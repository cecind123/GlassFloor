rating,review
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,It takes about 6 months to know that you’ve made a mistake accepting a position with Wells Fargo. It takes that long to understand why the turnover rate is si high
bad,"I don't recommend working the as a contractor to much work and low pay  and bad manager, every little mistake count and they can make your fire for a stupid reason."
bad,They sell you dreams of advancement yet never promote you. They work you day in and day out. I was 9 months pregnant and my manager MADE me do the ATM my whole pregnancy despite my complaints of physically hurting while doing so. It doesn’t matter the situation.. manager is always right. You are just a body working for this company and they don’t value you as an employee. If you want to be over worked under paid and unappreciated this job is for you
bad,Horrible company to work for. Every day I was stressed. Too much sales pressure. Never felt valued as an employee. Managers care more about numbers then actually helping customers or their team .
bad,Was in hospital due to kidney stones & threat to fire me if i wasnt coming to work after i brought mangers & supervisors paper work from doctors. Ended up quitting they are horrible
bad,I didn't have a good experience at Wells Fargo. It was a temporary position. Management was horrible. I wouldn't want to work in their lockbox department again.
bad,trained most of my supervisors in what I was doing and never got a raise or a promotion.  Our team was the best in the department and we had great camaraderie among ourselves.  We were never appreciated for our acquired knowledge.
bad,Did not enjoy working. I was overworked and underpaid and was never given breaks and was in fact just told to use time to eat when i can but not take an actual lunch.
bad,"Terrible company. Treated like a number, favoritism gets you promoted not hard work. Worst employer no room for advancement. Rate 0 stars if possible."
bad,Yet another service company not much to learn but recently company is making drastic changes to change the technology landscape which is exciting & other than nothing much.
bad,Only cares about making sales. Recent manager very controlling. Schedule never done till saturday before. You cannot plan dr appointments or anything in advance due to schedule always changing. pto requests never approved.
bad,"This is the kind of place and company you want to work for if you want to do the minimum possible and get no where in life. Management purposefully keeps you down so they don't have to work harder. NO incentive for doing well in the company, in fact if you do well the low level management will do everything in their power to make sure you quit or get no where. Even if you hit the benchmarks the management will lie and make up benchmarks to underpay you and keep you from advancing in your career."
bad,Stay away! Same old mess poor management poor work environment   They put employees against each other instead of encouraging a intact team.  They haven’t changed
bad,Wells Fargo will ruin your day! The managers make you sell products to a customer even though they don't need it. If you don't sell the product you'll get fired!
bad,The most corrupt company I have ever been a part of. Just google Wells Fargo corruption and prepare to be floored. This company only cares about their bottom line: Profit. They pay employees part and parcel of pennies on the dollar when executives rake in millions in bonuses every year. They lie to us in company emails trying to justify their corruption. Awful company that should have been dissolved when they opened millions of fake accounts.
bad,"•	Focused in analyzing clients’ situations and recommending credit products and solutions to help customers relieve debt obligations and achieve financial success."
bad,I had 17 yrs personal banking experience prior to Wells Fargo. My fiance was a news reporter and was hired one month after me. His starting salary was 7k more with no explanation.
bad,Please Do Thorough Homework Before Working Here. Very Negative Work Environment And Low Pay. Management Is Not On Your Side. Be Careful Who You Confide In.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Wells Fargo Financial  was the worst company I had ever work for.  It had broke down my morale and morals.  In order to keep my job and provide for my family.  I had to sell high interest rate loans that really didn’t make sense.  These loans preyed on the less advantaged people or educated. Wells Fargo Financial was eventually closed due to their predatory lending
bad,No work life balance and treated unfairly. No team work and managers get overwhelmed easily. When needed time off due to emergencies managers disapprove.
bad,"Not a career. Nothing but a dead end of circles on top of circles followed by a final dead end. Empty promises. Fake people. No development. Only care about numbers. Production, Production, Production, Production, Production, if its not Production, then its nothing"
bad,Horrible working environment would never recommend this job to anyone. Customer service is non existent for the bank it's all about sales by all means
bad,"nothing can learn "
bad,I worked for this company for 9 years and after being laid off. I tried numerous times to get back in and still to this day I have not been rehired. This company has no respect for the people that have been loyal.
bad,"If you're a woman, good luck getting equal opportunity. If you utilize HR, they will falsely accuse you of things you never did and not provide you with any supporting documentation. When you stand your ground, they'll terminate you."
bad,"Training took place in Manhattan where you get a feel for the culture WF wants to perpetuate. Once placed in the branch, it did not take long to see that the ""work life"" expectation was merely a corporate facade. Hired for part-time, yet was forced into unpredictable schedules that were not inline with given availability due to the branch's high turn-around rate. Computer-based training modules were made available to better oneself yet there was never anytime to complete them thoroughly, again, due to the lack of coverage and support. Management requires a complete overhaul!!"
bad,"My time at Wells Fargo, was one of the most challenging positions, I've ever endured.  Work/home life balance and the workplace culture was non-existent. I do not shy away from hard work but having an end time of ""work to completion"" which doesn't mean until your work is complete was unreal to me. Also the nature and time in which my department was notified that they would closing the department down and relocating was a little unsettling. My take away from this position, was prioritizing my workday based on the department as a whole."
bad,"The management was corrupted and unethical."
bad,"They do not care about their employees.  If you were as original First Union/Wachovia employee, Wells Fargo will do everything they can to get you out.  By far the worst mangers I’ve ever had.  They treat you so poorly."
bad,"Wells Fargo does not treat it's contractors with respect. The US based contractors are also forced to take 10 unpaid days off per year, note that Foreign base contractors don't have to take these unpaid days off. Also, the time limits for contractors were 18-months but now upted to 24-months.  I tried many times to get on FTE but WF policies don't allow for white males over the age of 40 to be placed on FTE position let alone if one had military service.  I think this is a very liberal orgainization that I really surprised hasn't gone under in the last few year based on its very shakey business practices both with customers and it's employment based."
bad,"management judges you, managers are not on your side. I wanted to leave my job because management does not support you. They questioned my work ethic."
bad,Do not apply proceed with caution ....Worst company and management ever ! They don't value their employees .The managers show favoritism towards certain employees ! Oh by the way they do not have a bonus structure.
bad,"Everything the got busted for by the government was standard practice, or at least encouraged by company culture. This bank is awful and shouldn't be allowed to exist."
bad,"The culture was extremely unorganized, leadership was all over the place, and lost to the point leaders some even avoided taking sup calls. Regardless if it was a brand new account it or not organization is key."
bad,"Leadership will not support you, and my experience has been that they are verbally abusive. No career path and work/life balance is non existent. I would not recommend this company."
bad,One of the worst companies I have ever worked for. Management constantly berates employees. Severely underpays. Expects employees to take advantage of the customers
bad,This company does not care about its employees. They also do not follow regulations for people with disabilities. There is no room for growth within the company.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,This company was a nice place to gain experience but they don't care about their employees or customers. Wells Fargo will also hire many managers that are external or do not deserve the promotion just to fill a slot.
bad,Not a good place to grow professionally nor provides the oppurtunity to learn newer technologies. Micro management is one of the major issues with the higher management.
bad,Unrealistic goal setting and constant pressure from managers. Hard work with bad number of hours and very low compensation. No job security and no advancement opportunities.
bad,I learned a lot from Wells Fargo and it enable me to move forward with my career. It also disabled me financially by reducing my salary without just cause. I eventually resigned to explore other opportunities.
bad,don’t do it. horrible work environment. no support. no appreciation. does not equip to do your job. does not value employees. horrible reputation as a company. do not value customers.
bad,"Cheaters and thieves.  They are the worst bank in America and perhaps the world.  Had to fire multiple CEO’s and the company still is under a memorandum of understanding!!  Pathetic.  Anyone who works there is foolish, in my opinion!"
bad,It wasn’t fair how it ended and I wish I had a better understanding after 15 years of service to be let go for no reason. There’s nothing much to report here.
bad,"No proper administration"
bad,This place stresses you out. Management will not help you. No structure and outside feels like a college campus. I found myself stressed out no help from management I came in with goals and no guidance on how to get there.
bad,Wells Fargo does not care about its workers. You are treated like a call center slave. Forced to sell and dishonest to customers and not allowed to move within the company
bad,Wells Fargo is terrible.  I wouldn't recommend working there is that was the last place in the world to work.  Wells Fargo doesn't care about the people that work there at all.
bad,"The advertised ""changes"" are non-exisitant. Still a sales based unethical culture from management. If you value your health don't choose this company, it leads to long term health conditions."
bad,"I’ve had jobs as a custodian before, this employer was by far worse than cleaning dirty toilets. Abusive verbally and emotionally, unfair, expected unrealistic goals, belittled in front of entire branch staff if you didn’t make quota the day before, forced to come into work sick and told to just vomit in the trash can, forced to stay late if you didn’t make quota for the day. Do not work for this company if yyou care about your mental and emotional well being"
bad,I worked for a couple of years at this call center and a day didn't go by where a co worker didn't threaten suicide or make homicidal threats. and Everyone was under tremendous stress and the company took no effort to offer assistance or make positive changes to their worker's daily struggles. Their expectations constantly changed leaving workers feeling clueless and directionless. I was so much happier after leaving this hostile work place.
bad,Very stressful work environment with no support. Sales goals are impossible to reach. Never are you recognized for work performed and sales is the main focus and not customer service.
bad,Will never change until the culture changes greed driven they play the semantics game very well increase your workload but pay you less the raises are an insult
bad,"Terrible Team focus.  Priorities were based upon job title, pay grade, and not on shareholder value creation/enhancement."
bad,Worked there for almost 11 years and I cannot say anything positive about that place I did a great job on my job duties and all management could do is bring you down stay away from business lending under Terra Tobin business direct
bad,hated the job. hated the hours. hated the lack of training and encouragement outside of first 6 week training period. worst job of my life. stopped banking all together after this job
bad,"Their loan officer software is antiquated, their new vp for the home loans department new nothing about mortgages, came from the credit card side of things and was completely egotistical and unqualified. His meetings were embarrassing he was so nascent. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,This was the worst job I have ever worked at. Straight mental abuse from customers and the company because wells fargo sucks and theres no support. It's not a great bank or company to work for. I would not recommend this job to anyone. You can never get a break. Tracked on everything and the management was not supportive what so ever. You cant breathe because constant calls of upset customers.  Everyday was miserable from start to end I felt mentally drained. I regret it it was not enough pay for the constant abuse and hatred. No support and no understanding due to me having school as well they would not work with my schedule. Too many things wrong with this company and bank in general. Dont work here!
bad,"Upward mobility is nil in the retail market unless you're one of the ""Good Old Boys"".  Issues with mid management are ignored by HR and upper management."
bad,It was very stressful to work for the Wells Fargo. I was not happy as an employee. The push to sell was overwhelming and stressful. Some questions were left unanswered. Training was lengthy and not managed very well.
bad,"Wells Fargo Advisors was the office I had the misfortune of working in. Truly toxic but if someone ""raised their hand"" there was retaliation. Never again will I work for wells fargo advisors. Anybody smart should steer clear"
bad,"This company only cares about making money and disregards the concerns of their customers and employees. They treat their employees horrible, state that you can transfer departments and then will not let you transfer. This by far was the worst company that I ever worked for."
bad,Working at Walmart is a waste of time for my level of education. There is a lack of advancement opportunities especially for those with college degrees. The company is run poorly and is severely understaffed. The funny thing is they expect you to do so many things and get away with paying associates such low wages.
bad,"Poor company culture, major political environment, and poor management. I would not recommend anyone to starting their career at Wells Fargo. Go somewhere else where you will feel valued and actually win some deals."
bad,The job is stressful the systems do not work. People are getting scammed by wells fargo. Management is all about who you know and favorite of picks when it comes to hiring management. Their are a hand full of African Americans in the call center in Salem. 5 African American managers there. You get treated like different. No diversity when it comes to the African American Culture.
bad,"Wells Fargo is the worst company to work for if you expecting to get treated fairly. Their pay is on the lower half of most companies in the area. The management is racists and full of ego. Human resources is a waste of time. Their systems and policies never match up. The customers are always frustrated because of the lack of transparency. If you want to work for a company that will make up lies about you, talk behind your back, and treat you like a 2nd class Citizen then Wells Fargo is the place for you."
bad,"I worked here for almost a year, I was involved in a terrible accident, the next day they asked me to come into work. they weren't considerate to the fact that I had this accident, and when I had surgery they didn't want to give me the time off. there were days I wasn't given a lunch break."
bad,I typical day was not very fun.  You had to call existing customers that have already been over marketed too and have no interest in speaking with anyone at Wells Fargo.
bad,"As a branch manager, they expected us to discipline through HR.. and after all of the “discipline” , if team members were let go, it affected our retention. "
bad,"Not enough people to do the work. Overlapping critical projects are tying up needed resources.  Projects are sloppy with poor testing and implementation. Projects are months and years behind schedule due to resource constraints. The constant usage of contractors from the big three is also a drag on work efforts."
bad,"I have outstanding cases ongoing against my branch manager and district manager! To no avail, WF has not responded in any shape or form! You want more, then address my unfair termination and the fact that the branch manager that unfairly terminated me is still there!"
bad,Not so great company to work for. Always had meeting that we contradicting to what was expected. Never felt like I was doing enough. Everything they teach you in the 8 week training is NOTHING compared to the actual work. you feel like you're constantly walking on eggshells. No guidance.
bad,Job requirements for a supervisor was a BA and 3 years experience in area. My supervisor had no college degree and no experience in what we did. But was hired for the position.
bad,Very terrible work life balance    Shady managers  could care less about customers     Worse change pay structure every week   Terrible place to work do not work here
bad,"the call center sucks and no one cares, they act like they care when you're in training and once you're done training they no longer care about your development"
bad,Wells Fargo Bank left me & my kids homeless when I left from there. It's by far the worse company to work for. I hate it & wouldn't refer anybody there.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,The management and business structure of Wells Fargo is a complete lie when I work there I saw many things such as customers being cheated if you did not sell them at least 16 checking accounts you're pretty much put on corrective action it is not sit well business
bad,"Unprofessional-ism everywhere, unfair practices, favoritism, good ole boy system. The company does not care about its employees or the customers. This department was one of the worst jobs i've ever had."
bad,"Wells Fargo is so messed up you can't get any work done.  The management there is totally clueless. They won't let people who know how to do the work have access to the systems and make you work through second rate indian contractors. A totally messed up company, AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS!"
bad,"They don't value their employees. I worked a lot of overtime and they expected and treated you like a robot. Couldn't take vacation bc there was a always ot. We could only take when no ot is required. When will that be? Never! I had put in my vacation, my manager approved it and told me that i waa doing well and then the next day they fired me and said that I wasn't meeting their standards. Not fair at all. We need are human too and need breaks too."
bad,"Pretty much you have to view every person as a sale. Act fake, and push the customer to get bankrupt by Wells Fargo, and you'll be successful at your job with no stress ever!"
bad,The worst company I have ever worked for. They treated their employees very badly. They made you work mandatory overtime without paying for time and a half.
bad,"Your success here will highly depend on what district you work in, who your managers are, who you are friends with, and how well you can put up with a stagnant company culture that rewards incompetence."
bad,"The culture fostered was to underwrite as many mortgages as possible.  It's a numbers game to Wells Fargo.  "
bad,"Grueling, mindless, stressful work. Soul sucking environment, designed to make you contemplate death. Don’t sell your soul to Hells Fargo. The pay is nice but you won’t have any emotional energy outside of work to want to spend it on anything."
bad,Rampant illegal activity to reach unrealistic goals by employees. Job threatened if goals not met. Area manager was encouraging activity. Leadership of company turned a blind eye.
bad,"Management was terrible.  no work life balance favoritism, no time off allowed, working more than my own work load, bonus was low. no flex time - lots of turnover"
bad,"You are micro-managed, can not make your own decisions.  Management is terrible, you have to get many signatures for a change request, it's all about approvals to get anything accomplished."
bad,"Wells Fargo was by far the worst job I ever had. I would never suggest it to anyone. The cylture was very negative, my manager made me cry on a regular basis and their reputation was terrible in the community."
bad,Poorly run and disfunctional!  Upper management does nothing to coach their associates or cultivate reasonable learning opportunities.  Advancement is zero!    The environment is bleak and the pay is pathetic uncommon for the industry.
bad,"When I start working at the company, the first day, I had an alarm in my head regarding the duration of the job. I have been told that the project was for 18 months. After the first meeting, I was thinking this won't last more than 3 or 4 months of development."
bad,"The company wants you to provide customer service, but their timing you on each call. The company lied to many customers about their services. The company makes it hard for you to make bonus. Lots of micro managing."
bad,"Employees walk by you in the hallways, elevator, etc. without making eye contact or saying hello. Cliques are quickly formed and gossip / bullying behaviour takes precedence. The competition with who knows more than the other or who can speak to a situation is better than the person who sits and does their job successfully. Upper management does not allow flexibility and discrimination is made against contractors. Favoritism is very common and obvious."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Wells Fargo is still stuck, within their old ways and the old history of america.  The more experience or education you have, the lesser your chances are with promoting/moving around. Too many Leads in positions they cannot uphold; team members' resolutions are used as their own instead of allowing those capable of completing the tasks to obtain the positions that fit their work ethic and sacrifices.  Knowledge is a threat. Highly stressful environment, over half employees are on some type of medical leave for stress or health related issues from stress."
bad,I was behind the teller line. Dealing with customers all day.  It was hard dealing with people with a lot of money.  The management at Wells fargo only cared about themselves
bad,"Its a typical IT job 9-5pm monday thru friday. The work culture and management is rotten and full of bad practices which are unethical and against policy."
bad,"My manager was incompetent as can be. I would describe her as a cold-as-I’ve slave driver, but that would be mean to black people. O wait, she fired our only black person. Never mind."
bad,"The management sucks, they are unprofessional ,the pay is poor.They show favoritism we are treated  with no dignity respect. We don’t have for advancement nor growth,if so it’s only pennies to take on more roles and responsibilities.The only only reason while I’m there is it’s by my house looking Fa a home and my job stability and I’m single if I had a partnership to pay rent I would quit rofay"
bad,"I would never go back having escaped during the highest points of sales pressure and unreasonable expectations. "
bad,"I was really excited to work there , but unfortunately ,I never felt that management was really supportive at the teller line. Wells Fargo does have a lot of rude customers."
bad,Worst place to work specially the one I. Spring. Even their newly hired just quit on them. They pretend they care about you. They’re fake unprofessional management who gets down and ghetto when stuff don’t go her way
bad,Favoritism you see it when you start to work there managers are always at Starbucks and take 2 hour lunches you’re pretty much micro managed by a work director that also falls asleep at his desk lets people use cell phones on the floor very unprofessional
bad,"Great company in as far a benefits "
bad,horrible people managers are only concerned about there own jobs never willing to take an risk or try anything new.  this is a punch a time card type employer.
bad,"I was working alot of hours doing more than what the job description is, underpaid overworked, They would steal your ideas take credit for your work.  Plus are not friendly to diabetics fired for taking insulin at my desk."
bad,"Bad working environment, lousy pay, no work life balance, terrible management, no job security, no opportunities for growth, bad culture, compensation structure is terrible."
bad,"Absolutely no work life balance, they do not care about your safety.  Manager's only care about impressing their superior but do not care about the well being of their employees."
bad,The place was a horrible place to work.  The expectations were unrealistic and I am glad people in upper management lost their jobs and the company was investigated by Congress.
bad,"I worked as a contractor at wells fargo. The group I was in, called Muni Matrics, was staffed with talented and experienced individiuals.  However, the company forced its employees to break the law."
bad,"Management in Spokane, Wa where horrible. This is a very unorganized company and they do not treat their employees with respect. It 's all about how much money you can make for them."
bad,"I left right after training because it was against my principal to ask each client three times if they would be interested on another product/service that i noticed/saw would be beneficial to them.  As a customer with (and thank goodness) with another financial institution, I feel bad that Wells Fargo pressures their employees which led these poor employees to open new accounts for their customers without their consent or approval just so they will not be written up leading to rumination due to lack or no sales."
bad,This isn’t a great company overall that I personally enjoy working for. The work environment is very unprofessional. The culture of Wells Fargo isn’t as it may seem either.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Hands down, one of the worst places I’ve ever worked at in my entire 30 years of professional work experiences. Entire organization of evil, money hungry crooks."
bad,"Wells Fargo does not care about their employees.  Management will give the corporate answers they do, but in the end it is all lies.  One mistake and they cut ties with the employee no matter how hard they worked."
bad,The place is a mess. They lie to you about your responsibilities. They require you to do unethical things. Hopefully they have gotten their act together.
bad,Very shady the service manager was very shady she wasn’t helping the teller line at all and the branch manager he didn’t know anything to be honest with you
bad,"Everything depends on upper management.  I worked with an advisor for over 13 years, but everyday my job depended on an upper manager who was not in our office and did not know the everyday workings of our office."
bad,Wells Fargo is NOT worth the hype!! They treat employees worse than the customers that are taking legal action! I would not advise anyone to work for Wells Fargo if you’re looking to work in a positive atmosphere with a company that uses inclusion while working with a team.
bad,"Worst Company Ever!!! I accepted a job offer from Weals Fargo 4 weeks ago and was asked to resign from my current position immediately, which I did. Wells Fargo sent the truncated version of my first name to their background company which delayed the process. I am now three weeks past my first expected start date. Everyone I was dealing with is on vacation for the next two weeks and the background check company has not even started the background process due to the recruiter, who is on vacation, not clicking an initiation invite from Wells Fargo's background check company. I was recruited due to my military service and then learned Wells Fargo HATES anyone who ever worked for the military. Run away from this company, they hate human beings and especially HATE anyone who ever worked for the military!!!"
bad,Not good it is a terrible environment. They have a poor reputation. People don't matter only production. Better suited for recent graduates starting a carreer
bad,"Makes you depressed, doesn’t value you as a team member. I have been with the company for over 4 years and it’s just horrible. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone."
bad,"I worked with a great team and due to the profit focused shareholders at Wells Fargo, we went to call center formats for customer service. We lost a lot of customers. We lost good employees. Wells Fargo didn't care about morality, just making money."
bad,It was a  very stressful  place to Work. I would not recommend   anyone t o work here. Horrible  management  and  a  horrible unobtainable  sales  goals.
bad,I worked here for 3 years. Was promised multiple things and they never followed through. Work home life being a single mom was impossible here for a long time career.
bad,"Wells Fargo only bases help and support on broken systems and numbers. The company does not care about you, the individual, nor the amount of stress they put on their employees. HR department doesn’t follow through and victim shames. Everyone just blames each other because they’re tried of the weight they carry. Upper management is too distant and has no idea what is like at the base level. Constantly asking for more with less. Sales goals have been taken away, but the job environment has only gotten worse."
bad,Would not recommend to anyone too many issues to management and consent orders.  Contstantly looking to place blame on others while not assuming reponsibity for their managment
bad,Terrible work environment high pressure sales disallowed for not meet numbers to pushy for everyone even regulars slow inefficient teller transactions because of prompted sales screens slowing it down
bad,"If you get along w/ your manager then this is a run of the mill corporate job. Problem is that if your manager doesn't like you, they can do or say anything & you will have no recourse. No work/ life balance. They will change metrics so very few or no people achieve bonus, so don't let them sell you on the great bonus structure. They switched my department with no warning multiple times, putting me in jobs I didn't apply for and didn't want so they didn't have to pay out any severance packages. Then, they allowed the new manager to block us from applying for new jobs that might have been a better fit for us. If you get a raise, it will be for 1% per year if you're lucky, even if you score high on their metrics because the managers can just arbitrarily decide not to allow you to get the raise you deserve and worked hard for based on whatever personal opinion they have formed. It's dehumanizing and degrading. Every company has an issue with playing favorites sometimes, and for the first 5 years I was with Wells Fargo and had managers I got along with, I just didn't realize how bad it could be. But, this kind of thing is built into the culture of Wells Fargo and it just isn't worth it."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Don't work here you will ne unhappy if you are an individual. They don't pay you enough for what you will be doing. They are not diverse at all. Just go to another company its not worth it.
bad,"poor management, hostile environment . Company still trying to making up with customer. Company promote as a good company but in reality they don't know what are doing."
bad,"Horrible company to work for. Their sales tactics are overly pushy and questionable, and the people who run the company are all bros that peaked in college (more on this to come). During my time here, I had multiple “leaders” and I was instructed to mislead clients into options that had no benefit. You sell on their ignorance. If a client doesn’t realize they’re losing money over 30 years, you sell it. You’ll be told to sell the worst loans so your leaders can win competitions."
bad,"Worked here for years. In that time, stagnant wages. Bonuses are boned down to the bare minimum. They say sales went away, but they only covered it up with a different name. They still pressure their employees to hit certain numbers. I left the company because it's going downhill. I don't know of anyone I've worked with who actually enjoyed working there. "
bad,"Collections department downtown at Wells Fargo specialty team is a joke not"
bad,Management horrible to work with. Unethical and unprofessional. They treat employees without respect. Not possibility to grow. Gossip from managers makes it stressful environment.
bad,"Terrible environment, horrible management,  you have to know somebody to advance regardless of how much more deserving that person is over someone that knows someone."
bad,If you want to be lead on for years with promises of promotion then this is the job for you. The rest of this is to meet the 150 character requirement.
bad,Was not happy there plenty of favoritism within the department not fairly treated everyone is always on there cell phone cannot talk to them they would tell you worry about yourself
bad,I have been a top producer for 5 years and have not been promoted and merit increases are very minimal. Work/life balance is ridiculous. The workload is horrible.
bad,"If you work any amount of time over your regular schedule, make sure it is exactly fifteen minutes for it to count.  If it is under fifteen minutes or somewhere in between you won’t get paid for actual time worked, despite leaving comments on your timesheet.  Comments are ignored.  They change start times often, despite what you initially signed up for and their job description is misleading.  If you like stuffing envelopes and no computer work, this is the job for you.  Team Leads are retaliatory and cowardly when it comes to telling you anything directly.  Horrible communication.  Had to figure out how to get into garage on my own and help other coworkers find the garage entrance even though they were there well before I started working there.  There is high turnover for a reason."
bad,"We were expected to forge signatures for customers who didn't want certain products. We had to do everything we could to try and get a customer to get 8 different banking products. We were expected to work off the clock on certain days to try and make our goals, which were impossible to hit. So you usually worked 3-4 hours unpaid a week. The hardest part of the job was smiling while management would curse(swear) at you or your coworkers whether a customer was present or not. The most enjoyable part was leaving. I reported these things to my HR and I was terminated for whistle blowing."
bad,Senior manager children are trained for supervisor position with only a high school education.  Employees with college education are forced to competed for jobs with high school graduates.
bad,"There was not one day that I enjoyed coming into the office.  The treatment that I received was inhumane, and although I complained nothing was done and he is still employed."
bad,The management was terrible and they didn't care about their employees. They expected you to push yourself beyond your limits with no appreciation or benefit for it.
bad,management micro manages the staff way beyond anything Ive seen before. They say you have transfer opportunities however its more you have to reapply and reinterview and have no priority over someone not trained already
bad,Really structured so a trained Monkey could do the job. Poor reputation so it's hard to get customers.  Fellow associates are  okay to get along with.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"I really don't have much good to say about Wells Fargo, so I'm not going to say anything at all. The coworkers I had made the experience a little bit better, but dassit."
bad,Management didn't have a clear path for my skillset. I didn't work with the tools I was hired to work on. I wasn't given the tools needed to excel in the position given
bad,"Just don't  even waste your time. Unrealistic sales goals, management is plain trash. Don't help at all. "
bad,Wells Fargo has a bad culture with no accountability for its leadership. It is all true as it comes out in mainstream media. They are unprofessional and do not treat their employees right. Working here is working with a company that really does not care about you.
bad,I loved working for Wachovia.  I hated working fo Wells Fargo.  I have had some friends and associates that continue to work there.  The culture is pretty much the same as I left it.
bad,"Wells Fargo has shifted to a much harder but noticeable aspect in how selective upper management and recruiting works around promoting individuals that has the qualifications to further their career, but its all based on who is on their inner circle and knowing the individual (friends/family) of a high position individual. There is no room to grow within the company and the hiring teams are very selective on the individuals due to the instructions provided by the hiring manager which is unethical to do"
bad,"Don't work there if you want to avoid being sue. Very little help given to anyone but top brokers, not a place to grow a business. not for young people"
bad,I worked there for 8 years and wish I could get my wasted time back.  Welcome to corp america where your a number and they don't care. I had a manager who was the worst and she is no longer there unmm wonder why
bad,Find other employment than Wells. You can not advance if the leaders don’t like you. I worked for them TWICE and both times were a horrible experience.
bad,"One of the worst professional experiences I've ever had. The manager was totally unprofessional, and I was one of 4 bankers in a new branch where about only 10 customers walked through the door each day. The manager would make me call the same list of 20 over and over again.Also make stand outside by the ATM if i didn't have enough solutions what they call sales almost on a weekly basis."
bad,Horrible place to work horrible work culture. Micromanaging is all time high here. Management does not care about you neither does HR. They always tell you you're replaceable.
bad,A fish rots from the head. They have a horrible corporate culture. They will throw employees under the bus at a moments notice and are always lawyered up and ready to sue you.
bad,They have so much to work on before they can be considered a great company.  One they improve they would be better but not yet. I was unhappy and always short handed andnit makes it harder than it is.
bad,"Bad management, super stressful place to work for.  high goals at the time,leadership was horrible, rarely took lunches due to high demand of work BAD"
bad,the company was so large.  It was not a good fit for me... I never knew who was doing what.. appraisal system was really horrible... the management was confusing.
bad,Wells Fargo is truly one of the worst companies. They do not care about their employees. Over 2 years of working here and still wasn’t able to advance anywhere. Even if it meant taking a pay cut. Wells Fargo is truly crooked and doesn’t care about their employees in the least. Avoid at all costs.
bad,I worked for a subsidiary of WF. It was the Auto Finance that was an acquisition of Wachovia (bankrupt). It was a very old school place to work where management was deeply entrenched and very clicke-ie. Most of the time was spend navigating politics versus straight forward work.
bad,"One of the worst banks to work for ever.  Management is only cares about management.  The employees do all the work, but management gets celebrated with dinners, and bonuses while employees get chewed out.  Do not waste your time."
bad,crazy amount of stress with sales... not worth the pay.. they make you do work the managers should do and give you no credit for it. after the lawsuites things might have changed but that was my experience
bad,I would not recommend working with this organization.  2 CEO's have been terminated in the last 5 years and the organization is poorly managed and under intensive scrutiny by the regulatory agencies for activities that are fraudulent as well as unethical.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Awful-my team members were treated unfairly and I had sexually harassed.  It took months of fighting with HR for something to be done about it.  I have had nothing but bad experiences with management with this company.  Wells Fargo does not protect the mainstream employees like it does it's managers.
bad,high pressure sales and not suppotive management.  Cared more about numbers in leiu of customers or employees.  Very stessful and never any praise.  Maybe differnt noe
bad,Management and department is bad very bad everything is disorganized no communication bi polar leadership too much work for single people leadership doesn't make decisions
bad,"Need more time for training to better understand the job especially if you had never worked in a bank"
bad,I would rather work where i am vauled and paid the amount of money after woek 8yrs. Im have been here for 8 years and il still not getting paid and i have yet to be able to get another position that pays decent so in reality im struggjng to make ends meet because I don't get paid decent
bad,The headline says it all. Another loan officer had 36 loans in his pipeline and they would close three to five loans a month his Fallout was unbelievable
bad,The scam was real. They forced us to sell solutions that customers did not want. They blamed us if anything went wrong. The managers were puffed up by corporate so they can continue with their ploy to scam customers and use and abuse bankers
bad,"Was the worst choice in employer I have had. The training is lack luster, and management was sub-par. The company itself was starting to come out with all of the negative publicity and I left due to the issues alleged against them."
bad,Would like to be able to work more hours. Commute is good. Work is not hard once you get a system going. Supervisor is helpful and gives me my space to get my work done.
bad,"I stop working with Wells Fargo before they got all the lawsuits, it was a stressful environment to work in. Managers weren’t doing the correct things and pressuring the workers do to more sales and sales and sales"
bad,"Unpaid overtime since expectations for what needs to be accomplished can not be done in time allowed. So you make up work on your own time or get a negative report for low production."
bad,I did not like working at Wells Fargo. They cared only about high stress sales and not about the customer service or the experience we as agents were providing
bad,"I didn't like the culture and their shady business practices. Furthermore, you have to be part of the clique to get anywhere. This is not an environment that I would recommend to anyone."
bad,"The news explained it all. High pressure to sell. "
bad,"Very stressful "
bad,I have by far the worst manager in my entire career here. She is a micromanager and an overall nasty human being. I do not wish anyone to have to suffer by working for this miserable person.
bad,I was not given any further training after asking specifically for more training during my time there. I was never given any further training for the position which I was hired for and only told that if I didn't catch on I would be shamed at meeting until I did catch on and eventually my position would be ended (Fired).
bad,"Management is not the best from lower management up to higher Executives. The LOB doesn’t care & management not there to assist you. Stressful environment working for Executive Office (CCRG) when all you do is fix internal employee/management/system mistakes! Pipeline management doesn’t work when you’re given 40-60 files to investigate & review, when it’s a job of 2 people."
bad,I would not recommend working at Wells Fargo. There is no work/ life balance and the company did not care about their employees or customers. It was for the benefit of the bank and not their customers or employees well being.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,A typical day was chaotic including lack of leadership. Very discouraging job long over due for overhaul of managment from top down. To many meetings not accomplising anything.
bad,It’s the worst company anyone could work for ...so much stress pushing for sales and hard to get days off so u couldn’t plan anything until we knew we gotten it approved
bad,Just read over their postings they are so vague that anyone with any clue of the area of interest knows they don't have a clue. So what happens IF the get someone in a position the employee is always rushed and pressured.
bad,I have nothing good to say about having worked for this company. It was poorly managed and they had a lot of unethical practices with extreme sales pressure
bad,Would not recommend. High sales pressure environment. Expected to be on the phones constantly making outbound sales calls if you don't have customers in front of you.
bad,"There are a very few good managers who actually know how to look after their teams. The rest walk around, including the site manager, as if you were below them, as proven in your title. You are expected to only work on meeting numbers while balancing a juggling act of QA rigid requirements. There is no room for anything else for you to work towards or build to other than how fast you can get through your calls. There is really nothing positive to say about the management group here. There is no leadership here other than glorified group of tenured personnel. As for the pay, you will literally have one check barely enough to pay your rent/mortgage and the next check for bills and other home needs - NO JOKE. The pay is not enough to meet a reasonable cost of living unless you have no bills or living at home with the parents. The training does not fully prepare you for the floor. Their computer systems are always shutting off  or not working while your on the phone with customers and regularly shut off every 30 to 60 minutes, all while balancing your time and quality. And last, the building is so very old along with the odors of having a large group of people in a very small space. There's no one to voice your concerns to because as lowly employees what could we know about providing anything worth listening to. This job is probably best fit for anyone who needs a temporary fill in until something better pops up. That's what I had to finally do and many others as well. Even the CEO recently resigned."
bad,As you can see all over media that upper management at this bank is disappointing. They have a favoritism culture and the only way to fro in this company depends on who you know. They blame front line workers first before the executives that establish the culture in the first place.
bad,Unhealthy work environment - poor management - stuffy atmosphere - horrific corporate culture severely lacking the clients best interest - very limited career advancement
bad,"Wouldn't work for Wells Fargo in future as I really didn't enjoy my time there.  "
bad,"Aweful and not stable. Turnover is Huge and the moral is not consistent. No loyalty, No support, Managers do what’s best for them not employees. They care more about everything and everyone else."
bad,"I can clearly see why wells is always being dragged in the media. Very unprofessional, has no respect or regard for employees. Understaffed over worked!"
bad,"No one knows what they are doing, I don't know how they managed to stay in business as long as they have. If you work there you will regret it get out as soon as possible"
bad,"No loyalty to team members with 10, 15, 18yrs experience.   Expect you to do your current job & the job you hope to be promoted into for 9-12 months before even thinking about posting the job that 100 others will also apply for. Constant changes with Policies & Procedures & extremely poor Communication to all levels of the team members.  Constant turnover in both Mgmt & Production. Then the new Mgr. usually has staff that follows them, which means any open or new postings are taken by these external hires which means very little room for advancement."
bad,Wells Fargo is unanimously the worst bank to work for in the United States. Many ex employees go to suntrust. bonus pay is good (if you are meeting outrageous numbers. I never was able to make payout 401k matching doesn't start until after your first year of work. Management treats you like a number and if your not meeting your sales goals. you are criticized and pointed out in front of other coworkers daily!!! (supposedly it helps with motivation) There is no help for management. They are under the same pressure as bankers. The stress levels are ridiculous. Yoga maybe?
bad,"This branch of Wells Fargo no longer exists. This was my first job out of college. I try to learn something from every experience. For this one, I learned that Id rather work somewhere else"
bad,"Enjoyed the job, good people and great opportunities to grow. Opportunities for growth and opportunities  for extra income through hard work. Many other opportunities that I was not able to use."
bad,"The scheduling was terrible. They did not care how the weather was, they wanted you there. There was an ice storm and they would not let us go home early. A 40 minute drive took me over 1.5 to get home! THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES!!!!!!!"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Micromanaged by an insecure, inept manager who discouraged me from communicating directly with people above his position. Same manager treated me like I was an idiot and yelled at me more than once."
bad,company culture was not as advertised. company was sales driven and not customer driven. very cash focused. very profit focused to the detriment of the customer.
bad,answered phone calls about equity loans provided customer service made sure to help as best as possible before transferring to another department set scheduled breaks
bad,I personally I had a very bad experience poor management and very unprofessional. I had a great relationship with my customers. However if there was better management that treated their employees with respect it would be a great place to work and learn new professional qualities.
bad,Wells Fargo was a very unprofessional job to work for actually one of the most unprofessional jobs I’ve ever worked for in my life because management was very unprofessional and would discuss any and everything among team members and upper management didn’t care to address issues because they were to busy gossiping as well and they would only promote people they like of were friends with and only gave raises to employees they like and would makes excuses as to why you didn’t qualify if your weren’t apart of their click or people they associated with.
bad,"Wells Fargo has a legacy culture that comes out of the 19th Century.  The emphasis is all on making money for the bank. Recent litigation is proof of that statement.  CEO Sloan discovered just how difficult it is to change a company that has been doing business the same way for decades.  From overly competitive and insecure co-workers to biased managers, Wells Fargo is a workplace to avoid, not create a future."
bad,"Terrible place to work, too much pressure.All they care about was sales, thats why they got into trouble. They call each sale, a solution, I hate that word!"
bad,This place was nothing but a failure to its employees and customers. This company didn’t care about making anyone happy except management. I did not enjoy working here but I did get a chance to meet some great people.
bad,Lots of meetings but accomplishing nothing. Lots of agendas. A company that promises a lot and seems not to keep them. Workers are disposable. Didnt feel set up for success but more set up.
bad,Wasn't the type of job that I wanted long term. A lot of good people work there but there monthly goals were easily obtained if explained correctly to customers.
bad,"One wells is not adheard to, they have different rules for mortgage and auto, and they would be a factor in accepting a job they do not live up to the vault they preach"
bad,"Its a nightmare when you report to a bad manager who lacks knowledge and unable to provide with support you need to do your job and use threats and  micromanaging. You’re constantly suffocating and hoping to make it through the day without losing your self esteem. Upper management has no idea what middle management is doing and causing good employees to quit. With all the bad press going on, you would think they would actually treat their employees better but it’s not the case. The damage is deep in the roots and will get worse if they don’t do something about it."
bad,"Poor Training  and Management "
bad,"Miserable company to work for. Abuses employees with constant mandatory overtime. When moral falls too low, they will find reasons to write-up employees so that they can eventually be fired and replaced by cheaper new employees."
bad,Terrible place to work lack of leadership and growth fraudulent bank stealing from the little people giving to the rich doesn't live thier true visions and values no work life balance
bad,Heavily sales driven to the point of exhaustion. Leadership would meet with you every couple hours to check in on your sales numbers and then make you stay for after banking hours calling to meet sales quota.
bad,Of course they treat you like a BAREFOOT SERVANT.  They're bankers.  The worst possible human beings on the planet.  Don't expect even due respect working for these hyenas !
bad,Favoritism was one of the most important problems and interruption during work. But it was just one branch. Maybe other branches are good. The manager was new too. So it could be the new management which was bad.
bad,"Unethical business practices imposed by management made it very stressful (this was back in 2014, before these practices were exposed to the public) but I know the culture is probably still the same. They have been sued for numerous unethical practices. Find a better company with better values that treats their employees and customers better."
bad,Wells Fargo is one of the best companies that I have ever worked for. Management was awesome and they made sure you was properly trained to do the job successfully! Awesome!
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"i worked there for 3 years and didn't move up as a banker."
bad,"Too much of a gap between the skill sets and experience levels of people managers and their teams. Worked with many team members who exceeded manager capability to make a decision, drive change, and truly accelerate the work. Program and project culture needs an overhaul of roughly 70% of the workforce or training post-evaluation. Change management practices require standardization by experienced leaders and managers - not vote of confidence placements."
bad,manager was always rude to everyone she thought she was better than others never knew how to multitask with out being in a bad mood things where always ok for her but not for others
bad,The atmosphere was not good and the management was horrible I am best thing about working there or was that the customers with building the rapport with the customers and some of the coworkers were amazing
bad,"I felt ,often times ,my personal ethics and morals and character were being violated by the tasks I was required to complete for the company, with my sales. The opportunity for growth is few and far between and the pay is rock bottom . The demands and stress is grueling and there was always an excuse as to why promised bonuses were not paid . I finally left the company because my conscience would not allow me to use my sales skills to swindle young and elderly and military people even though I could have. I refused . People hold value to me . They are more than a bonus to me."
bad,They hired me knowing I was pregnant but when it came time to actually stand by me they did not. Since working here I have found myself very scared to do what I love after being fired while in the hospital giving still birth. This is the worst company to work for.
bad,"Horrible- soulless atmosphere, sneaky clock punchers- no energy...felt like working in a morgue. "
bad,They take no pride in their employees. They will throw you under the bus the minute it doesn't benefit them to keep you. I would not suggest anyone work here if they can avoid it.
bad,It was Avery stressful place to work. Concentrated on all sales and that’s all they cared about. All scripted sales which was a pain in the butt. And the wrong people got promoted
bad,"Wells Fargo brings you in on promises of raises, advancement and skills that will take you far in the business world.  In reality Wells assigns its workers titles that aren't relevant to their work in order to ensure their future prospects are limited and they are forced to stay with the company despite the constant mismanagement, HR infringements and indecent conduct in regards to the well being and financial stability of both it's workers and customers.  They have no problem letting an employee believe they are doing a wonderful job and are working towards a brighter future until the day they complete their Automation projects and then lay them all off to supplement the costs of that Automation. Their HR team is atrocious and after submitting a case for clear Harassment, Discrimination and Relation not only failed to do anythign about it despite plentiful evidence but instead retaliated against the harrassed individual and eventually firing them for not speaking politely enough to their harassers/aka Management.  This person only asked for a fair pay raise with the threat of discontinuing extra work if that raise was not received (also note individual hadn't gotten a raise in 3 years)but after asking for a fair pay increase they were abused by management and turned into a pariah by the entire organization.  This is just one example of how corrupt the culture is at Wells Fargo but it is not the last nor is it the worst and no one with any decency will have a safe and reliable job as long as they work at Wells.  There is a reason they had all these Scandals in recent memory,"
bad,"Sorry but I have nothing good to say about Wells Fargo. Very competitive work environment. Gossipy, people trying to get people fired, not a healthy place for anyone to work who is empathetic like I am. Too much negative energy."
bad,"Wells Fargo is a completely unethical company that should no longer exist. They have committed so many violations against their customers, and have lost the trust of their employees and customers."
bad,WFBM was not a good place to work.  A lot of negative people and not very good training for people new to the industry.  They were not careful with destroying properly personal documentation.  Did not train very well.
bad,"Don't have one to give on this company, I was pleased with them for the time there. That's been years ago and I'm not going to be able to make any comments"
bad,I spent a year there surfing the internet on the Full Circle Team. Finally the day came to do what they hired me to do..I attended two meetings and told them all they needed was a simple 2 week code change that another department had to do. They told me it was a brilliant idea and then I had nothing to do again. Terrible management
bad,Not impressed with manager at location.  Pushed to open as many accounts and push for credit cards as humanly possible.  Not offered benefits of any kind.
bad,"Wells Fargo has a horrible culture! They treat their employees with no respect and insult the intelligence of educated workers by having managers that are non-educated and no where near qualified to be in that role. Executive level managers come up with goals that are unattainable and cause more confusion on the floor than assistance. The ability to move up in the company is based on who likes you and not what is brought to the table; no matter how hard you work! Unfortunately, Wells Fargo will continue to thrive no matter how horrible they treat people."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Work environment is micromanaged and Wells Fargo is your life. They don't care if you have a family, commitments or appointments, work is first. My work schedule is 7am-3:30pm M-F. I rarely get to leave at 3:30 and if I do, I get ""talked"" to about it. In September our job title changed and we got a raise. We finally got it on our paychecks in December. Then the manager decided HR messed up and we shouldn't of gotten the raise, so they took it away. The manager did say we didn't have to pay it back, ""Merry Christmas."""
bad,"Extensive amount of nepotism combined with recruiting friends and family instead of talent has killed the company's spirit to advance. Also, moving from bank to bank just to get an increased pay check brings lot of inefficiencies."
bad,Wells Fargo would be a nice place to work for if you have the right management. I worked at night and my manager was out of her mind! She didn't know how to talk to people and she is very unprofessional. She spoke to the employees in Spanish who spoke English and to me that is very unprofessional and is not a way to set an example for someone in her position.  The turn over rate is too high! I worked there for 4 months and too many contractors were let go or quit because of management. No company should have that many contractors as Wells Fargo has had in the past.  Someone really needs to look in that and see why the turnover rate is so high!
bad,"Looked at as a second class citizen, as I came on originally as a contractor. Management has no semblance of order, consistently cannot answer even simple policy questions and atleast in my lob dont even seem to be annoyed that productivity is lacking. My advice, look elsewhere."
bad,"When I worked their it was too sales oriented and not about the client. No extra perks, and bad work life balance. Management continued to pressure you to talk the customer into things they didn’t need for the sake of goals."
bad,"Inconsistent management, lack of follow-up training. Management disrespect. Can't depend on them to keep your job in this area. Not good for people with disabilities or needing unplanned access to bathrooms. Saturdays/Sundays and evenings required."
bad,You only got advancement and raises if you were a single mother or some other race than white.  Management listened to your concerns but blew you off and always canceled meetings unless it was to tell you that you broke ethical standards after management told you too.  Wells Fargo is not an equal opportunity employer.
bad,I was not happy with the Company as I was told I would become permanent.  But that was not the case as the dept was going to be transferred out of the country.  Also there was alot of micromanaging and no organization.
bad,Won't bank with them won't work for them and won't emdirse them at all. Every goal would change as soon as it was met making it impossible to bonus unless you unethically cheated by opening accounts without the customera permission
bad,no room for advancement. pressured by upper management to meet the sale quota. no work/life balance. pay is low compare to the industry . workplace culture is not the greatest.
bad,Not great place to work. Management is AWFUL. Vacation time is ok but you cant take it when you want. Company is not a great environment and goals are unrealistic.
bad,"A call center is hard in general, but this company is untrustworthy and has the worst management I've ever encountered. DO NOT WORK HERE. The pay isn't good enough for the stress that is put on each person. You will never have the support you need when you have questions. The amount of information they expect you to know is ridiculous...so if you need help you have to put someone on hold for 5 minutes or more while you run around searching for a manager that you're probably not going to find. The management is rude and unprofessional. Again, I can't stress this enough, DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY."
bad,"Over all I had a good experience they moved me up from my teller position within a year. They believed in me and wanted the best for my career. I think that they had a bad reputation back when I started and when I ended my job, they were being sued. They had good trainers and nice facility, but some of the people there were unprofessional."
bad,I has offered a full time position from the contracting position I held and they never followed through. They lied until I was eventually let go do to budgets.
bad,Too much time worrying about goals than the customer experience. Managers only care about their numbers instead of making sure their employees are up to date with regulations
bad,Good place to learn customer service skills and a great place to help people. But it is a tough environment to grow and also there a favoritisms played by management.
bad,"Commission paid at Wells Fargo was one of the lowest in the Mortgage Banking community.   Bad management in that they were always changing managers and area managers.  Not a stable company to work for.  Also, closing offices and managers every few years."
bad,they are not ethical there.  not under standing at all. you are just a number to them . atypical day you get so many calls you cant even take a breath.
bad,"Too much gossipy, too many bosses, no manager at all, they abused you if you're not part off the hanging out group (drink and.....), you can ground but they don't let you"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"The work environment , specifically the branch where I used to work is discriminative and harassful work place.  I am glad that I am out of that place."
bad,"Sufficient to say my boss - the person that recruited me for over a year - left the company about 5-6 months into my employment. He ""sold me"" on moving to Wells with the promise of training and learning new areas.  I received NONE of those. "
bad,"During my time at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, every employee was highly pressured to push ""targeted sales"" while handling very serious mortgage concerns in under 3 minutes per call.  The idea is to simultaneously deescalate mortgage customers while trying to get them to open a Wells Fargo bank account, credit card, or other frivolous product that was impertinent to their needs.  Many people were wrongfully terminated for 'not making enough sales', despite needing to achieve perfect scores in literally every other metric of their ""MPP's"", and being listed as a Top 10 or Top 15 employees in various metrics on their weekly email recaps, myself included.  Less than 6 months later after I left, the scandal broke out that has sent Wells Fargo to fire dozens of top executive employees, all because we were pressured to make sure customers had at least 8 Wells Fargo products - hence those fake accounts we all keep hearing about."
bad,It was the worst place i have ever worked. I was fired while i was on medical leave by letter only through the mail. I would never referrer anyone to bank with our work with the company wells Fargo
bad,"Low pay, impossible sales goals, poor communication."
bad,"Took over Wachovia and then bought out. When it was Wachovia, they were decent to work for. They also paid really well for the work we did and they were extremely flexible."
bad,It’s ok not good not great and some bankers aren’t trained to do their job.  The managers are ok this is a good starting point but they have no issues with giving you more work without pay.
bad,"worst company I've ever worked for in my life, unprofessional management, daily racism very stressful environment a lot of favoritism and banker picked certain tellers they wanted to help"
bad,"Wells Fargo is morally corrupt.  I had to perform duties that crushed my soul.  For example, I had to tell an 80+ year old woman, ""didn't you plan for this?"", after her husband died and she could no longer afford their mortgage payments."
bad,"...It's even worse in real life.  Only work for Wells Fargo if you're on the verge of homelessness."
bad,terrible culture and they do not support speaking out.  Retaliation was the means when I spoke up.  Management should be held accountable for bad decisions and lack of involvement in processes.
bad,8+ hours on the phone in a daily basis with a strict atmosphere that makes you feel almost as if you’re constantly walking on egg shells. There is a strong disconnect between supervisors and their management.
bad,"The environments where harsh, stressful and you were reminded on a regular basis that you were nothing more than a temp. However, I did maintain a great deal of experience which allowed me to move on to a better company and better pay."
bad,"thousands of wrong calls from customers, always people getting written up, managers are never there, they don't have clue how to teach people how to do work,,running people credit and saying sorry"
bad,Good place to start out training for a bank work enviroment but make sure you get all the paperwork you need for any disabilities or allergies you have before you start or you will not get any of those days compensated
bad,garbage place to work. Fake account scandal proved that. We did not work for our customers. We worked for the greedy corporate investors that look for artificial growth.
bad,Just overwhelming and the things they tried to make us do was unethical and they were sued. It was non stop upset customers being extremely over charged for bank errors
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,I worked a contract position in Payroll. My manager didn't speak to me the entire time I was there. It was a very stressful position that didn't give proper training.
bad,Horrible place to work there is a lot of retaliation against women of color and being promoted or heard. you can never get ahold of anyone in HR and they are behind on everything no communication within the employee or customers needs.
bad,"I can honestly say both times I worked for Wells Fargo in my lifetime were miserable experiences.  The management was poor and uninvolved with the staff.  Also the over all morale was tanked, no one I ever worked with there had a good thing to say about the company."
bad,"You might think that trying to cultivate a happy workforce as an elusive, time-consuming waste of important resources, but studies show that the opposite is true.  Creating a positive company culture begins with fostering happy employees."
bad,"Confidential would prefer to leave this blank for now "
bad,If your not the same race or not a favorite of the Managers regardless of how hard you work you will not go anywhere.  Regardless of how well you are working and doing your job.  The Managers will make something up or talk down about you so it justifies his or her actions. If a person looks at everything and research this matter you will see there is truth to this. Managers has to much power to do anything they please bc they can get away with it. I am speaking of the Managers I have dealt with.
bad,Gaming was happening while I worked there and it was common practice to try and meet your numbers.  The preached to push products that customers didn't need or want.
bad,"There was no work/life balance. Forced to sell products to customers who did not need it. Management will force you to work weekends, even if you requested off."
bad,They make you over deliver to meet goals and then you get reprimanded. They make the policies and they break the policies depends on who does it. They do not give the opportunity to investigate the cause. They are an at will company they will terminate you if they do not like you. They discriminate on race.
bad,"Worked my behind off for this company and NEVER was noticed.  POOR MANAGEMENT and unless you know someone you go NOWHERE!!!"
bad,Favoritism applies everywhere. Bunch of bullies. A lot of people will say it's is a nice place to work. This is only true if they like you. Worst Place to work for.
bad,"This job was less than desirable, management is completely out of touch with employees. Goals are unachievable and when you get close they always find a way to disqualify you."
bad,"Bad company to work for.  They rip-off there own customers and employees. Old boys company. "
bad,"I worked in a call center in Clive, Ia.  The supervisors monitored bathroom breaks and was a very stressful atmosphere.  Poor management that preyed on the fact that during the banking collapse they had a job and bragged that WF would replace anyone.  Forced overtime and micromanaged by power hungry managers."
bad,The management is all about hooking up and promoting their friends and people in their circle of friends. They don't care about your success or your abilities they just take care of their own friends.
bad,Not a good place to work if you have too much pressure on sales. Feel like better location is better sales positions than another place. Just. Leadership is very important.
bad,"Management lied to me, made promises then denied making them, and was indifferent to laws and regulations. The processing department was horrific. Anyone would be better off at a Savings and Loan or Credit Union who will value your experience and efforts."
bad,Back stabbing bosses who only care about reaching their bonuses is what you'll encounter at this employer.  They don't care about the customers and they care about you less.  I would read the newspapers and know that the whole truth has yet to be heard.
bad,The worst ever - nightmare. Pressure was so high to bring in business and cross sell where you were forced to open accounts for clients without their knowing
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Required to sell at least one or two accounts to new and existing customers. Very unprofessional, at least at the branch I worked at in S.F. on Bayshore."
bad,not a fun atmosphere. management was uneducated. micromanage everything. treated like children. salary was extremely low for the amount of information required to know to do the job.
bad,"Good teams within the company however the upper management cuts your job without any regard for you or your family. They will take your job in a heartbeat and blame you just to get rid of people as they hired to many people to begin with. Used to be a fun place to work, with the housing market slowing down this place will likely not be an place to move up or enjoy you work/life for a long time to come."
bad,Would never work for them again!! Not flexible. Favoritism. Management was no where to be found when you needed something. Worst work experience I ever had.
bad,"Working for Wells Fargo was my worst experience as a Loan Officer. Wells was initiating a systems change (going from paper files to paperless system) in early 2015 and as a result my loans on average took over 120 days to complete. I spent my last 6 months with the company apologizing to my clients daily for the production delays on my files. My clients and I were beyond frustrated with our inability to close my loans. I lost all faith in the company's ability to deliver our loan products as advertised. Management didn't focus on the production issues which were creating the client frustration, but instead  focused on my hourly habits that I spent both in the office and at the branch I was assigned to (which had the lowest volume in the region) and micro-managed me in an effort to make me resign. A terrible and unfortunate all-around experience for me."
bad,"To sum it up they have low pay but such high expectations in an environment where they preach ""culture of caring"" but management could careless. ESPECIALLY their upper management, your typical call center."
bad,"Nothing is fair, the branch manager does nothing, the service manager has to do all of the work, there is never enough tellers when needed, we get horrible benefits and can never go to the doctor without paying out of pocket, the district manager does not care about how horrible the branch manager is, it is a negative place to work and employees don't get paid well."
bad,"Terrible place to work.  Harassment, discrimination over political.  Working at Wells Fargo  was such a horrible experience.  Team members overly competitive, HR and managers do not care about their team members."
bad,"This used to be a great place to work and employees were highly valued. That is no longer the case. "
bad,Did not like the goals and the culture of sales.  Management was not educated in finance but rather just promoted internally.  Just like all corporate banks
bad,It wasn't a fun position. A lot of pressure for nothing. Unfortunately you are stuck in the position unless you know someone and they have to like you for you to advance.
bad,I didn't work for this company very long. There was no structure and breaks were not consistent. There was no room for advancement and the management was very unprofessional.
bad,All white people working here were slowly being replaced by Asian people. Why? racism against white people and in Minnesota we are the most gentle loving and helping people this country has.
bad,Current-state means that C-level is committed but far too many employees in jeopardy from poor execution. It's imperative to address organization behavior and project difficulty so a balanced portfolio can be actionable and executable. Too much of a mixed bag between great or incompetent co-workers. Don't recommend.
bad,"Workers do not get paid what they should for all they put up with. You are always pressured to sale even when there is ""no"" sales there is still goals you have to meet."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Maybe the worst employer and company to do business with. Your will be treated as just another number. The promotions are reserved for people they already have in mind. Their sole job is to make money for the investors. That is it. It is a eat or be eaten environment. "
bad,"I had a bad experience with an unethical superior. I wouldn't recommend this type of experience to anyone. Avoid this if possible. I felt working with people's finances, they deserve to be told the truth about what the bank is doing."
bad,"It was bad management, that's all I can say. A lot of unqualified people working for the organization. They just want to pay qualify people to do the job they just use the high school diploma and training them to do the job with bad quality"
bad,"The work itself was interesting enough. I wanted to contribute more and was not given any opportunity, It is my belief that the contract between Wells Fargo and the firm that was 'leasing' my services as an employee was more lucrative, insurance wise,. or unauthorized account wise, than it was to simply employ me and pay me a salary. "
bad,"Wells is probably only good to work at if selling isnt Your best thing. The interview process stinks. Also, it’s a wast of time, because even if there’s a job posted, the job may have someone in Mind within that branch already, and everyone going on the interview is wasting their times and gas! Also, there’s no way of getting a transfer, you have to interview for the same position, and that is ridiculous!"
bad,The management had no clue how to do the job they were supervising and were never complimentive of a job well done.  Always what you did wrong.  When tried to complain about another departments attitude towards an issue was never taken seriously.
bad,"I never felt good about working for Wells Fargo.  They're just not a well-meaning company.  And they treat employees terribly.  No exercise reimbursement or free gym, no reduced meals, literally no perks.  It was very much ""feel honored to work here"" mentality."
bad,"My work day was driven with stress to perform."
bad,"Wells Fargo is a company that doesn't care about your work or your growth. This place is all politics. People with zero skillsets get promoted and those that deserve it, don't. Save yourself the energy and work somewhere that cares about your growth and appreciates hard work."
bad,"Ok place to work if you like lying to people. Lots of stressful times, pushing mandatory sales. It was a bit relaxed sometimes, but that would just depend on the day."
bad,Management was not proficient in field came from different dept just to save his position with in company. I was never happy to assistance when needed.
bad,"Company had a culture of extreme sales pressure and would condem you for not opening enough accounts , district management would mico manage account openings every day and would just pop up"
bad,"The most corrupt company I have ever worked for. The management force their employees to do unethical sales practices, then fires them when the employee gets caught, while denying any involvement."
bad,"a very stressful, unconcerning and worst company that I ever worked for.  they have not concerned foir their employees or customers. I would not recommend at all"
bad,Felt like a number to them that was disposable anytime. I would rather not say much about that company. they had poor leadership and didnt treat me well when i was there
bad,"would not recommend it to no one, worst place ever, management doesn't know anything and they treat their employees like no one cares. no follow ups and no room to grow with the company."
bad,At the time of working for this company nothing was wrong. Wells Fargo was still well known for a good place to work till they started cutting thousands of jobs.
bad,Not recommended. I would not advise anyone to work at Wells Fargo. It is not a company that stands behind its employees. Nor does it genuinely care about customers.
bad,All of the recent lawsuits and stories are 100% accurate. I was asked to do so many unethical things to attain sales goals. Managers walking around with clipboards every hour harassing about sales.  Terrible!
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Typical day is helping people with their finances, the good and the bad."
bad,"The manager at the Wells Fargo forced us to create new accounts for the customers without their permission. The Directors and upper management knew this was happening and ignored it until the news came out. The Human Resources department also ignored this situation. They are still doing this same type of scam, just are being more careful about it. I would close my accounts with them immediately!"
bad,"they do not treat contractors well at all. your title within the company will always be non-employee. you will not be able to apply internally, and must always be treated as non-employee. any regards to pay or other non-work help is always directed to your contracting company."
bad,"Would not recommend anyone work here.   Hours are not flexible for working parents, rules are different for different levels of employee. No guidance, no mentoring, no growth opportunities and benefits are terrible."
bad,No support from management at all.  They are too busy with themselves to help with any problems or questions you may have.  They tell you one thing and then expect you to do something different.
bad,"There were goals to meet and the supervisor/managers were more worried about the goals than letting you do your job. You couldn't speak freely to the customer, you had to use their specific wording or you would get dinged for it."
bad,"It was too much if you didn't meet production you were called on it even if you had been around there for a long time and worked hard."
bad,"I've worked at Wells for about 2 years. It's terrible! The pay is decent and the work is mind numbing. The 'culture' is the problem. Hiring friends instead of leaders from within. Complete waste of money on things like thousand dollar chairs (uncormfortable and plastic) - you could have bought La-Z-Boys for that! Software testing for software they have zero intention of utilizing. Compartmentalization to the point that not a single person really knows any entire process, including management. ZERO procedure or technical writing. Training is non-existent for anything other than caller center positions. No room for advancement. If you want to move up in a field you like, you will first need to move to a different LOB for a year or two and then hope a position opens in the one you wanted. Most positions that are/have paid well are being outsourced to India faster than you can say 'curry'. To boot, though, they are still as corrupt as ever and do not care about their customers at all."
bad,Management is horrible. Most employees are more concerned with how they look and walking around in tight dresses to get customers. Would not suggest anyone to work here ever!
bad,Sales pressure and bad tactics to obtain across whole company.  Company is very lack in ensuring their tellers are taken care of rather than achieving their sales goals for the day regardless of how they are obtained.
bad,"Never received negative feedback on my position was always advised my department was secure.  Always received positive performance reviews.  Stayed within the same department, dedicated to my work, was brought in and advised I was laid off.  Was escorted back to my desk, told to put an out of office message on my email and my phone.  Then had to pack my desk in front of my team and was escorted out the door in front of everyone.  Never been so humiliated in my life.  I have the option to try and apply for other jobs within the company.  Thanks but no thanks.  They are reporting that they are going to lay off up to 10% of their staff over the next three years.  I would avoid unless you are desperate for work and then when you are there keep looking for something outside of the company.  While they lay off 27,000 people the executives are ever changing and always giving themselves raises."
bad,"Credit investigation, credit analysis, credit underwriting, "
bad,They treat you like a number. Most of the managers worked their way up and do not have a degree. Waste of time and life. Good luck if you decide to try.
bad,"Poor management, poor recruiter, poor HR, I’m very insatisfy with this bank, poor selection, discrimination about qualifications, bad training tellers, I think the Wells Fargo bank could be better than right now"
bad,"25 years of service. All the lying and sins they've committed are coming to fruition. Unfortunately not for the working employees, just the racist managers. Either way the company will go under shortly. "
bad,Everything was number based and very little care to the individual/employee. Personal life is not taken into consideration and it was extremely difficult to work there as a single mother.
bad,"everything from day one was a joke. you're lead to believe you will succeed, then there is favoritism, nepotism,  extortion, exploitation, people sleeping with each other, drinking on lunch breaks and physical harm done on site. it was ridiculous."
bad,"I was constantly pressured to open accounts and services that were not needed by clients. when i refused, I was written up under the guise of ""Not meeting goals"" Management was fully aware of the these practices and did nothing to stop it because they were under the same stress and deceit. "
bad,"All of the things that you have heard in the news about Wells Fargo is absolutely true.  They treated their customers terrible, stole from them and lied to them and they treated their employees the same.  Do not work for this company, I worked here for 8 years in 3 different roles.  So I am speaking from things I've seen. Not to mention I've worked at 3 different location so I'm not just being biased to one location.  HORRIBLE PLACE TO WORK!"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"I have been laid off twice at Wells Fargo. The first time was in 2004 as part of workforce reduction. The second time to eliminate my position. In each case, it wasn't due to performance or job functionality. I was denied a promotion to OSE 5 due to management policy, not performance. I was also demoted because I opted into a salary lawsuit against the company. It took two years just to get promoted to OSE 4, even though I was doing OSE 5 work. I was not compensated for on call support, nor was I compensated for extra hours (weekends and evenings) that I spent supporting the technical environment. I was given tasks to do without any training. Even when I asked for it, I was ignored and had to learn on-the-job. I was pigeon-holed into certain tasks and was not given opportunities to learn other skills. Management didn't care about me and never intended to find me another job when they knew my current job was being eliminated."
bad,"I worked for a company that was acquired by Wells Fargo, who initiated changes to departments and staffing immediately.  Not long after the merger, there was no one left."
bad,"The culture was very depressing, only focus was production, the pressure led to bringing friends and family in to open accounts. I would not recommend working at Wells Fargo."
bad,"Would not recommend working for Wells Fargo. It's all politics and favoritism not work place performance at all. "
bad,"If your manager likes you you get promoted "
bad,I didn't like working there.  I also didn't like the management work ethics.  They played favoritism with other employees who was hired from other organizations and they do not hire from withing.
bad,"Horrible place to work; "
bad,"Wells Fargo is a stifling place to work."
bad,"Working for Wellsfargo will give you the banking experience, but the company culture is a scam and how they mistreat employees and customers is absurd. If I had the second chance I would of chosen another industry or workplace to maximize my potential rather than waste it away at Wellsfargo."
bad,Its been several years since I worked for this company and I'm in no position to comment on that time frame. I didn't dislike the job but nothing stands out that is worth while
bad,On going legal case regarding a hostile work environment. Management did not bother to hear employee's reasons of why production did not meet goals or expectations.
bad,"The Worst Company I ever worked for, Management was a bunch of bullies that really didn't have product knowledge or relevant computer skills. I hope they collapse and current management is fire and better yet jailed"
bad,I was aware of the issues that Wells Fargo was involved in when opening accounts without the knowledge of the customer. I called HR a couple of times and made complaints. To which I never received a call back for or follow up.
bad,It took 3 months to start and I had a bun in the oven when we started. I didn't think this would be a problem but I had a target on my back for 2 yrs.
bad,"One big, leaky boat, where corruption, nepotism, and wrongdoing reign supreme. I was sexually harassed continuously, did not have management support to execute my business plan, and the list continues...."
bad,Easily the worst company I have ever worked for.  I would rather scrub toilets at the airport than ever work a single day at Wells ever again.  Simply awful.
bad,there was advancement back when I worked there they just took over northwest mortgage and that is how I became an employee and also had the opportunity too relocate .
bad,I am sure that you have seen all of the stories in the news. They are accurate and this is the worst company possible. They do not care about people. They only care about the bottom line.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"If you can handle stress and BS from management and not the customers this will be good for you. Management is terrible, sneaky, unorganized and rude."
bad,Wells Fargo was a very independent company. They had high expectations. They wanted what was best for their customers. They did all they could for them.
bad,"I would never want work at Wells Fargo ever again. It is a very pretentious environment. It does not recognize individual achievement. You will be asked to do legally questionable things and when the media catches wind of it,it is you who will be on made the scapegoat. Whatever position you hold will pay significantly less than what other offices will pay performing the same or similar functions."
bad,Wells Fargo terminated my employment with them after they bought the bank I was working for.  I have no information to give about this company.  Good Luck
bad,A lot of sales were required and I was not fond of sales or selling items to customers that did not need to use a certain account. I didn't like how pushy sales became.
bad,"not a recommendation for work, don't care for employees, money driven, scheduling was always so complicated and sometimes wouldn't be out on time, gossip throughout the company was horrid"
bad,No Comment about this company. I have nothing good to say about this company at this time. I had a bad experience with management and co-workers alike.
bad,"do not do it to yourself. Unrealistic expectations, no work/life balance. The management was terrible, i got written up for going to the doctor at 4PM."
bad,"Better compensation "
bad,This place is a very horrible place to work. I would suggest staying as far away as possible. its a vulture atmosphere and very toxic. Don't bank or work here
bad,management was very bad at the time i left before it was very good the new teller manager had a lot of favoritisium for women and she was a headache it was very stresfull to make the sales a lot of pressure
bad,"I was not happy with the senior management team   They did not support the sale team as they have promised.  "
bad,"Wasnt happy and expressed my concerns, and people constantly getting laid off. And being told to not worry about any of it. "
bad,Very bad experience I will not work for Well Fargo ever again. We were forced to sell products that were not in the best interest of the customers. I did not approve of this.
bad,Wells Fargo isn't a place to start a career. They tell you its easy to advance in your career there at wells fargo and you ward extremely hard and get no recognition.
bad,They don't reward for hard work. Its about who you know at the company.  Those are the pweople who get prom oted.  Not the hard workers.  There is no type of development for advancement.
bad,Do not work there unless you are complacent and do not want to advance. Not enough ways to advance you can literally be stuck as a  teller for 3 years and they hire some one with no banking experience over you for a higher position. Managers were always good but your experience will definitely be based off of your branch.
bad,"stressfull, low pay, demanding management, no enjoyable moment at work, any place to work is better than Wells Fargo, no promotions, compensations are always stress full"
bad,"Through my many roles at WF my team mates were the only bright light in my day and the reason I stayed as long as I did. My DM was so very aggressive, bordering on verbally abusive that it made the sales goals feel like you had to achieve them or you would be fired. I could not do many of the activities that were asked of me because they were wrong to force customers into products that they did not need. It was best for me to move on to another company."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,I was laid off before going to wells fargo never worked for the company so I cannot answer any of these questions. All though I am sure they are a great
bad,"They dont have the culture of taking care of their team they only care about how make up sales to the customers and forcing the customer to open accounts, and get more loans. That is not called a bank thats called theft. And regarding the salary I hold bachelor they offered me job of Only $12 an hour !!!!in Home Mortgage"
bad,"25 years of service. Manager could have cared less. You are nothing but a number to them."
bad,inconsistent company to work for. Wells Fargo seems to be culturally insensitive to potential job seekers and employees   ..................................
bad,"not interested at all to talk about Wells Fargo I am not looking for a job there at this point, but some other people really like it over there. I think is whatever fits your needs"
bad,"poor management ,lack of ethical work habits, unethical behavior is practiced from branch to branch. Managers are focused on sales and not customer service. Employees are pressured for sales goals."
bad,"not change to advance in a career, they consume your time, and as an employee I was more at work than with my family. a lot of micro management and manager"
bad,This company was a bad decision from start to finish. I equated working here everyday to the feeling in your stomach when going to the dentist office to get a root canal.
bad,I just did not enjoy working there. It has a HUGE pressure for sales.  the environment was always high stress and i needed more flexibility with school.
bad,"They made it difficult to build relationships with clients due to the aggressive sales goals. It was hard to focus on helping the client succeed with their financial goals. As a manager, you would try to develop your team, but upper management looked at numbers, not behaviors, and insisted on always writing up your team."
bad,"If possible, do not work as a teller in Wells Fargo. Management was horrible, not enough employees, tellers were overworked and not paid enough. Management would verbally harass employees."
bad,I will never work for a company like that very inconsiderate never again.I don't feel a company should treat they're employees in such manner. You live and learn the situation never weakend me as a person.
bad,"It was Wachovia  when I worked there.  I was hired to be a Relationship Manager, but due to consolidations, I ended up in branch as a financial specialist.  I was hired to do insurance and investments, but instead ended up selling bank products.  This was not a good fit for me as the culture was too pushy."
bad,"the job wasnt that bad, but my position did not have much room for advancement. It was difficult dealing with team members in other departments that were incompetent yet making more money than me."
bad,"Wells fargo was just ok. Having worked there for more than 15 years, most of the work was sent to sc. We were all downsized without notice. Watch out."
bad,Do not work for these people under any circumstances. They will lie to you and treat you poorly. Were guilty of unethical business practices. One of the worst companies I have ever worked for
bad,"I didn't like it. I think they are racist and they do not care about their employees. I would not recommend anyone to work at this job and if you do, document everything"
bad,"1) typical day at work: I would come in, sit down at my desk, log into programs needed to do my job and begin taking calls--"
bad,"Being a teller for WFB wasn't bad, but the up-selling was pretty unethical. That, and disagreements regarding up-selling with my manager was the primary reason I left."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,This company only cares about their higher up. They do not care for their employees that are under their DM's. I would never work for this company again. It is so sad to see all of the money that Wells Fargo waists.
bad,"Management for me was lacking. I was in a sales role and didn't receive a single new lead for 3 months. I had other ways of getting business sure... but not enough to meet the very unrealistic sales goals. Now, Wells Fargo isn't even allowed to grow as a company per the Federal Government. So yeah, when I worked there, they were trying to expand at an unsustainable rate."
bad,"poor work culture "
bad,"This company fired me after I had been out on disability for my messed up back. They looked for a reason to get me out the door, this was the first Job I had EVER been let go from. It then started my road down work anxiety that has only continued to worsen over the years so thanks a whole lot for that Wells! The worst company I have ever worked for!"
bad,"Sell company products. sell ideas of debt free."
bad,"Do not work for this corrupt organization. Read the news. See what they do to you, or your family. Everyone is affected. Do not give in to this garbage organization. Be a part of the solution. Do not work for them, close your accounts with them and move on. It is time for their imminent failure."
bad,"Poor workplace culture"
bad,"A typical day at work is assisting people with their home financial needs. I enjoy helping people purchase their dream home, starter home, second home, vacation home, etc. Making a dream come true for Wells Fargo Customer's has been a pleasure."
bad,It was extremely hard to get a bonus especially with the area the branch was located in. The manager talked down to all of their employees and treated them as children. The customers were disrespectful and the manager let them be that way.
bad,"Typical day at work for the minority women contractors was dealing with a manager that was unethical, lacked leadership and was unprofessional; allowed the male colleagues to do whatever they wanted, and did not act on inappropriate behavior from the males on the team."
bad,"Just watch the news, and you'll know all you need to.  If you like micromanagement, phony people, and a glass ceiling for an old school work ethic, then by all means.  It's totally the place for you."
bad,By far the worst place to work in. The Management style is terrible.  The pay is horrible and they don't care about their employees at all.  Will expect you to show up to work even under the most horrible weather conditions.
bad,"boring job, poor management. no room for career growth. poor leadership at the department level. no employee motivation. stress work environment.!!!!!!!"
bad,"Very hard work for very little compensation. The management team also seems far to 'casual'. Did a bait-and-switch right off the bat, about what days were to be scheduled, and it went downhill from there."
bad,When I was hired I was so excited only to be disappointed once I started in the branch. I did not like how they tricked customers due to hard sales goals.
bad,"Management was very high stress sales driven. Management was disrespectful, and un-concerning when it came to personal time off if you had kids when they became ill."
bad,By far the worst and least ethical place that I have ever worked. They micromanaged everybody so much. They would walk around and stare at our computer screens. Very high stress. They wanted to know where you were every second of the day. Absolutely no autonomy. Lower level management and senior management did not feel it was important to resolve ethical issues. I had a meeting with my manager and his manager and left a formal complaint letter. They did nothing to change their culture. They would not reimburse me for my tuition after they already agreed to it! They did not compensate us well at all and often treated us like we were numbers. I have never hated working at a company so badly.
bad,"I worked in a dead end department for two years. The pay was bad, the hours were bad, and management was bad. Not much more to say but this section is unfortunately mandatory"
bad,They encourage you to lie and to steal from customers or there is threat of job loss. That place is STRESSFUL and no wonder people are medicated. Terrible.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Do yourself a favor and don't work there. Worst company EVER! They would have to fire all hire ups for the culture of this company to change, their reputation matches their daily business practice. This company lacks integrity."
bad,"There are many good reasons to avoid working for Wells Fargo - lots of illegal and unethical things going on, leading to billions of dollars in fines, and a push to do things which are not in the best interest of the customers."
bad,"The bank is a horrible machine that is /has ruined the advisor side of the business."
bad,I was very unsatisified working for this company. Goals were unrealistic and ethics were not followed. Employees were encourraged to meet sales goals at all costs.
bad,"While working at Wells Fargo, my coworkers and I felt like we didn't have a voice. Management was inadequate/sub-par, for lack of better words. Managers would stick together despite their wrongdoings. Managers wouldn't adequately resolve issues, especially at the expense of job loss. The service manager showed favoritism and was extremely combative with Tellers. Illegal and unethical practices occurred on a weekly basis by the service manager. We were pressured to perform at erroneous metrics for the sake of surpassing our sales goals. The hardest part of the job was knowing that your boss stood in the way of advancement and would use negative reinforcement as a means of corrective action. Workplace culture was terrible-unbearble. We were not happy. The most enjoyable part of the job, besides the bonds I made with my fellow coworkers, was the day I resigned. That day, I regained my independence, integrity, and confidence. That day I regained my voice."
bad,It's okay work was stressful but was easy to help customers an work on computer I liked working with others an going onto work early morning also the manager were very helpful
bad,unethical nonprofessional damage my career for not matching the racial preferences of a member worst work experience in my life abuse me verbally for matching the racial preferences of a customer.
bad,"No longer work for this company.  I started my banking career with Wells Fargo.  I started as a part time teller and worked my way to a Service Manager,  I managed 7 tellers and 4 platform employees,"
bad,The worst place I ever worked at. Stay away. The worst 9 month of my life. I rather work at McDonals than work at Wells Fargo ever again.  The manager would threaten to fire you everyday.
bad,The firm is weak in the wealth management area and I would not recommend the firm.  Manager in the Morristown office is awful and provides no support for his staff
bad,Typical wild west!! Upper management looking to hire unethical middle management. Almost seemed a requirement. I would not recommend WF to my worst enemy
bad,"You should never come into work only to feel stress all day every day.  The training or lack there of need to be longer than five weeks, this will help."
bad,I was told I would be told weekly what all I needed to work on. They gave me a clear idea but then never actually did it and then gave me a hard time over everything. They over hard-pressed us to sell and the management never listened when I ask for their help they would just rush me to push mistakes that I admit that I had made.
bad,If you are going to go into the banking industry make sure to go in on the side that best suites your personality.  It is very difficult to move from one position to another.
bad,"As a part-time person you will open, close, and do all the work while full time people are gone, on their phones, shopping online, texting on their phones, chatting, snacking, gossiping, etc."
bad,"Wells Fargo is a horrible place to work. They have horrible managers, horrible ethics, and they do not care about their employees or their customers. Management openly discusses other employees business to other employees, Management in the banks are particularly terrible to their employees and the customers."
bad,There is a lot of turnover here and if you dont meet your goals for new accounts they will find a new person. The atmosphere is very competitive since everyone wants to keep their job.
bad,"I did not appreciate the unrealistic sales goals while I was employed by Wells Fargo, I left due to being asked to do things I knew were wrong, and the fact that it was happening around me."
bad,"Work on a computer and try to listen to customers over team lead, assistant team lead, and banking coach yelling to supposedly motivate you but it drains you and hurts your ears.  Then the other coworkers talking about gossip and how dumb their customer on the line is."
bad,I didn't like working here.  The requirements of the metrics and selling unnecessary products to customers was the thing that kind of turned me off about them.
bad,"This place is extremely busy and stressful."
bad,"Unflattering Environment and leadership. Low salary for experience , promotions are rare for internal members. Probability of opportunities to advance = 1%"
bad,"They did get tanked publicly and that was all the truth. What do you expect when companies bottom lines are profit? Sales pressure is a given in these environments, and so is internal fraud, due to said pressure."
bad,"Very restrictive environment, and I found the corporate values reprehensible. Couldn't quit soon enough. I will say the people I worked with directly were generally nice."
bad,Workplace culture was pleasant; was treated well; management  was available and helpful;good hours; rating not currently valid - been years since I worked there
bad,Management is a lacking sensible vision for their IT infrastructure and takes it out on employees when things go bad.  There is very little  concern for direct reports and the focus seems to be to just making themselves look good to upper management.
bad,Mortgage industry was going through change. Wells Fargo was no more or less friendly than any other banks surviving at the time. The bank is not employee friendly.
bad,"If you call the ethics line, you get fired when they are doing unethical practices such as opening account without the customers permission and you call to report it to the ethics and it comes down from the CEO to fire you."
bad,"Poor management, low pay, pushed heavy for sales.  the hours were inconsistent, little flexibility.  we were constantly being pushed to sell more and more every quarter, competing in not a good way."
bad,When I worked there all they focused on was sales. The location of the bank was not a very good one and many checks were questionable. I would not recommend working for Wells Fargo.
bad,"Wells Fargo has you lie, cheat and deny what is right for the borrowers.  The managers literally destroy all motivation employees have to do their jobs.  Most employees are on depression medication and anxiety meds."
bad,I loved wells fargo before I started working with all the creeps I worked with I wish they took better care of their employees and really cared about their personal lives and paid the employees what they are worth
bad,"This was one of the worst places I have ever worked. The company does not care about their customers. All they care about is making more money by selling their patrons product that they do not need. I could not continue employment with Wells Fargo because of this practice. When I refused to sell unneeded products, I was told I would be written up and eventually fired."
bad,very uncomfortable environment to work in supervisors used customer service techniques to influence employees mangers micro managing employees no opportunity to advance
bad,"I worked for Wells Fargo over 4 years ago, and don't feel that i have an accurate representation of their process now.  At that time I was not a fan of the job itself which is why i sought other employment."
bad,"bad company, improper sales practices.  do not work here, stay away.  even as a teller you will have sales goals and now they have commercials saying they dont have sales goals but it is a lie."
bad,"Only concern was sales. Mgr would interrupt during appointment with client to see what you were 'selling'."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Would not return. Workplace culture poor as employees are constantly being over managed to meet goal. employee moral is down. I enjoyed leaving the job.
bad,"Did not enjoy working there I look forward to not needing to ever deal with Wells Fargo again "
bad,Do not work for this company. They lie to you and they make you apply for packages for customers to increase the numbers. They do not back you when you need it.
bad,"you are stuck at the same job, unless you leave the team or the company.  I wouldn't recommend to work here.  Management push employees too much so they could get their bonus."
bad,"Things may have gotten better but this place treats you like robots!  When I worked there, the time you spent at lunch was at the discretion of your manager. Overtime was mandatory, they did not care about your home life. You were scolded if you took to long in the bathroom. And we all know about the sales culture! They cared more about accounts being opened than their employees and customers. I also remember being written up for calling out sick one day....hahaha. Worst job ever!"
bad,"You'll hate your life here. You are just a number and they don't care if you are alive or dead, they have the same outlook on their customers. Everyday could be your last day here."
bad,"I learned how shady their practices were first hand and refused to work for them anymore, so I left. The bonuses were alright I guess but that's if you reached their ridiculous quotas."
bad,wasted 2 years of my career will this company. Poor Management  No Communication. Fun Place to work but  because of lack of communication it was stressful
bad,"EGS India(Wells Fargo's service based ) is run by some managers who understand they're Good."
bad,"very stressful, very stress full , very stressful, not fun, poor management, unfair , inconsistent rules , not a fun working environment , very stressful very stressful"
bad,Not a great experience this time around with my employment there.
bad,"Lost in space organization that does not have a clear strategy on much of anything.  People talk, people walk but they never deliver here.  It is a comedy of errors from my perspective.  They really need to clean house at the top."
bad,"Following the Fiasco that happened in California, Wells Fargo decided o stop focusing on sales that Fiscal year and deveop a more consumer friendly Customer Service Program. "
bad,Workplace culture was very slimy.  I could not get a hold of anyone that was working on home loans for resolution of any client questions or concerns which led to poor client experiences.  It was like banging my head into a wall.
bad,"o	Managed a large pipeline of loans to ensure that files handled efficiently and timely."
bad,The mangers care more of numbers and production and have no empathy and they have zero tolerance in errors it’s more like a jail and made to do mandatory overtime
bad,"Wells Fargo Advisors doesn't care about the financial advisor, only their bottom line. WFA takes a large chunk of your commissions and make it so complicated to figure out if you are getting paid correctly.  They even round down and keep dollars of your earnings just to ACH the funds to you monthly.  If you push back on the culture they just let you go without remorse."
bad,this is an awful company to work for and have been fined by the us gov't for over 1billion dollars because of ethic violations to employees and customers
bad,"The bank culture is nothing like Wells Fargo"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"The pay is not enough for a single mom. With living costs (babysitting, rent, car mantainence and other) is a struggle to work there. Even though their culture is all about helping you keep growing, that is not the true for everyone. It depends in who is your manager and how they work with you. For all the tasks and survillance you get as an employee, you will find that you are actually being underpaid."
bad,Terrible work environment per management. Great team leadership and friendships.Weekends off was a plus. Customer relationship building and self development.
bad,"Alot of sales pressure! Makes the customers annoyed ! Even if you have asked customer twice about the opportunity for credit card or loans, management still wants you to continue to ask customer."
bad,The manager of the Licensing department is a tyrant. The supervisors try to make the work place culture a positive environment. However the manager isnt acceptable to change.
bad,This was just a Temporary Job While I was Looking for other Employment that more closely related to either of my areas of education. I enjoyed the people I worked with for the most part but felt pressured to up-sell services.
bad,This was not a good experience working here. A very toxic culture and terrible management. Lots of gossip and back stabbing. I was very relieved to finally leave.
bad,They treat you like you're an idiot at Wells Fargo. Even though you know more than upper management. Wells Fargo is a very unethical bank. Stay away at all cost. There are better places to work.
bad,Would not go back. Management is no good. Manager became involved with assistant manager which was promoted to Service manager which is a higher position. When one was out of the branch so was the other leaving one person in charge to handle over 15 employees.
bad,"management is only concerned about numbers, not what it takes to get job done or the employee.  you were constantly on edge that you would lose your job.  No self  gratification."
bad,long hours.  never want to py enough people to work.  overworked.  undercompensated. everyone plays favorites.  they will lie on you and force you out
bad,"Working here was a disaster. They had unrealistic goals based on the location. The management was never helpful and quite condescending. For a lack of a more educated word, they were very shady."
bad,"On a personal note I always loved my customers and always strived to take care of their needs first, but as far as the management and fellow staff members things went on that I didn't agree with, things were reported, and issues never seemed to be taken care of and were swept under the rug."
bad,"Terrible culture, hostile to contractors. Do not work for Wells Fargo, unless you're absolutely desperate. Even then, make certain your resume is up to date to take something better."
bad,"This was a very stressful job. You are not guaranteed a job if you do not make your minimum numbers, even though you make your mark on going to Hawaii twice out of five years of service. Poor reliability of the quality of work."
bad,"I've had a lot of sales jobs, but there is a reason that Well's Fargo has the reputation that it does. ""solutions"" goal was not reasonable, and management fostered an environment of ""turning a blind eye"" in order to hit goals due to lack of morality by DM's and above."
bad,"It was the worst job I ever had.    Goals were not able to be met , by anyone.  Leadership team was not helpful. Worked in Eden Prairie, MN and was not happy there."
bad,"I didn't get pay for overtime. The manager ignored my overtime hours. They know it's illegal but they just do it, from the manager to district manager. We complained to HR. They ignored us too. It's a toxic environment. The pay is low. I don't recommend this company for anyone."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Was an awful place to work for. I literally wish I never would have went to work at wells fargo. It caused migraines and my endless hours of hard work went unnoticed.
bad,I was working in the basement. Breaks were scheduled like you were still in high school . Not a very positive place to work in my opinion . We got in trouble if we went to the bathroom too often. We couldn't go get a drink or coffee or whatever unless it was during the scheduled time.
bad,My direct manager and his manager are very biased towards certain team members. It is very much like high school and you have to be in the “in crowd” to succeed
bad,Very cyclical company and lays people off when times are lean  but hires when times are good. I was laid off 3 times  in 14 years along with my whole team.
bad,"not a good company to work for, poorly managed, unfair to staff and customers. Unwilling to work with their employees to resolve employment issues. Micromanaged employees."
bad,The management was very poor.  I don't know how some of those people ended in management positions.  All they did was gossip and it made me wonder what they said about me.  I would never work their again.
bad,"Wells Fargo should be require to have a health warning.Wells Fargo Phone Banker call center is the very worst place to work. Unrealistic time limits set on calls for customer account servicing. Call Center is extremely stressful, irate customer all day long. Required to up sale on each and every call. You are not a person you are a number and the numbers are all they go by. Never any exceptions. Very high turnover people can not wait to get another job. Very low pay."
bad,"Management was the worse and like at any company they would have their favorites and treat everyone else however they wanted.  Very unprofessional people to work with, especially management."
bad,Lacks the proper management skills for the the department that I was in. The call center should run the same hours that a regular bank is open instead of the rotating hours.
bad,It was ok but I would not ever return for employment. There were management issues and nothing was ever addressed in an orderly fashion. I dont believe it is a family workplace.
bad,"With all the requirements for performance evaluations, etc. annual evaluations remain primarily subjective for employees,"
bad,"It was great when it was First Union/Wachovia. Then Wells Fargo took over and it became a nightmare. Lots of pressure down the line to sell, and very little recognition when you did."
bad,worked with a lot of nice people just being able to talk to people over the phone was a wonderful experience I just love when the customer say thank you so much for helping me made my day
bad,"Don't put your livelyhood in their hands.  Racist and cut throat. "
bad,typical day was stressful i didn't learn a lot working there and management and the workplace culture was horrible. hardest part of the job was the lack of communication and how management did not prepare employees
bad,"No actual training, no manager support; very cut throat and it is encouraged. There is nothing more to say; it was a very odd working environment. Ok?"
bad,I would never here ever again. I would work her again. They were terrible an drove you to do unethical things to get sales. they also scare into thinking your job was in jeopardy if you didn't meet the sales goals.
bad,I was disappointed in the unfair management and the fact that they had so many employees that were fraudulent.  Also they expected employees to be professional and respectful however they could speask to their employees in such a condescending tone at times.
bad,Wells Fargo was not a good place to work they required you to produce and if you didnt close any loans beacuse your draw was negative you would get laid off
bad,company does not care for you or about you or your well being. They thrive on pressure and stress and force you to have unnecessary conversations with clients in order to sell something.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,This was before all of the drama with the lawsuits so maybe things have changed. But while I was there a year ago for three years management was horrible but now I see the pressure they were in as well.
bad,"I was not big on this job, I felt like I was just a number. my manager didn't know my name until 6 months of being there and all the extra hard work was not noticed."
bad,bad company only there for money not for the customer also to many demands poor management and really bad hours poor pay for the work exspected all in all poor company bad policies
bad,Wells Fargo was a horrible place to work that did not treat their customers with respect.  They only cared about getting more money for the company. I would never bank there or work there again.
bad,"Actually I never worked for Wells Fargo, during my early days at Staples I was a senior customer services representative that handled the Wells Fargo account."
bad,I would not recommend Wells Fargo to anyone. This place was great to work about 3 years ago. Then the new leadership they brought in to collections department didn't know anything about collecting cause they worked BK and FC. It's just all about who you know. They don't give a care about their customers or emoloyees
bad,"Can't do your job due to the negative work environment.   Lacks respect and sensitivity towards employees.  Leads slack off just like the managers until there is a visit from higher up.  Managers aren't around so didn't have access to funds to meet customers needs.   This branch has no values, beliefs, direction, teamwork, trust, future, skills, leadership,  equal treatment, and two way communication."
bad,It was a pretty boring job. The end of the day always came but some of those days I wasn't sure. Had mediocre coworkers to share the time with. Cut and dry.
bad,This was at the time Wells Fargo Financial and not associated with the retail bank. We did mostly cold calling and it was for customers who had never met us.
bad,"Typical work day, included, arguments."
bad,"There was nothing I liked about working in the Home Mortgage Department. The managers were horrible, the job was boring, and the pay was barely minimum wage."
bad,"I was employed at Wachovia On Call was never employed with Wells Fargo"
bad,"It felt mis-managed, once a quarter on release of the next update had to work until 10pm then work the next day (Saturday) at 6am to support the release"
bad,"Management would “listen” to concerns about work flows and training processes, agree with you, and then do nothing. It was 100% stat driven with no leeway. Training was inadequate before taking calls and nonexistent after hitting the floor. If at all possible, work elsewhere."
bad,"Not very friendly to work for, They didn't care about my needs and always were trying to find a why to get rid of people. "
bad,"Wells fargo exists to please the shareholders, employees are not valued. Pay is below the market. Management is poor at best, most competent management left the company awhile ago."
bad,"As a contractor for a Staffing Agency, I found myself in a role that was not advertised to me. I enjoyed learning the systems they employed for streamlining the Mortgage Process but the pay was substandard and the role was beyond reasonable expectation. When I came on I requested I not be in a call center environment and away from scripted roles as that worked against my skill set and physical limitations. In essence, they lied and I found myself in a strict call center environment in which a simple thing as going to the restroom could bring about severe disciplinary measures. It was no joy and all stress."
bad,"I was a temp to hire contract worker and immediately regretted taking the job after meeting with management. My contract assignment supervisor was encouraging and believed the training would go well. Overall, the management staff was a bunch of over-stressed, passive aggressive people who had no knowledge of any kind of how to lead a team or department. They overworked and underpaid you and demanded you work over-time to make up for the fact that their strategy to bring down call volume was a sham. Their selling practices were borderline harassing and, in my mind, criminal; the lack of turnover due to lack of sales was astonishing. Despite being out of work during the holidays when my contract was up, I was happy to have left that job. I recommend strongly that you stay away from temp to hire scenario's when it comes to Kelly Services and Wells Fargo."
bad,"The organization was all research, investigation, determine the problem of the issue and resolve the issue. The typical day consisted of in-depth research of customer account activity, complaints, financial mishaps associated with the account that required research in fining the source of the problem. The work environment can be stressful at times based on the complexity of the problems being investigated. Overall, the organization was a great place to work and it requires skills in detail-orientation, problem solving and resolutions."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,if the training was better wells fargo would have a lot of people wanting to work there but over all is still a horrible company to work for its only about collecting money and nothing else
bad,Wells Fargo is a poorly run company from top to bottom and fails to stand up to their promises whether in writing or not. Typical day within Wells Fargo's real estate sales division resulted in handling consumer complaints due to missed promises or expectations with the end goal of up selling them into another product.
bad,Wells Fargo is abusive towards its customers and employees.  Unfortunately this starts at the top and trickles down.  They claim they care about customers but the truth is that everything is done to benefit Wells Fargo.
bad,Great place to work but seems hard to promote out to other positions.Plenty of openings but very hard to get out of the call center. I suggest not making the call center your first stop. You do learn alot about the banking industry in the call center because they teach you alot.
bad,"Job culture was more focused on profits then what was best for the customers. In my short tenure with the company I saw quite a few unethical and immoral practices which led to my decision to leave the company. There was little to no management supervision and when management did supply input it was always negative in nature. "
bad,Company originally started out well in 2010 while it was still considered partially Wachovia.  Over time the sales goals crept in and caused a great deal of stress and a very high turnover rate.  Management either was helpless to change it or didn't care it was happening.
bad,Very busy day supporting various senior leaders. 
bad,"did many things for wells fargo, small task like organize mail and sort files. clean desk and also answer phone calls and other computer programming. a little of everything."
bad,"underwrite usda loans including reviewing incomes docs which includes pay stubs, w2s and tax return. also review the customer credit reports. also work closely with the home mortgage consultant and processors"
bad,My experience was disparate treatment. Management would reference the knowledge of being underpaid as if it were a lifestyle for this employer.  Individuals from the outside would come in making more money and the existing employees would have to train the new hire.
bad,"Sales goals were outrageous."
bad,"but was merged with Wells Fargo during the financial crash. Culture was totally different, Wachovia valued customer service, and Wells Fargo did not. It was a very stressful environment. I have no idea if the culture is different now, as everyone I knew has left the company."
bad,"Very biased, hard to keep up with stats, great pay, flexibility with schedule, great management, open door policy, learned awesome customer skills, met different people with different backgrounds"
bad,They put unrealistic goals on their employees that caused fake accounts to be opened and a hostile work environment to be created. Liberty did not have a manager or service manager for like 2 months and the whole place went to the dumps.
bad,Fmla discrimination. No lunch. No overtime allowed even tho you worked over time.  Management pushed in ethical sale tactics. Maternity leave issues. Harassment
bad,This place is a joke a bunch of unprofessional people getting promoted not based off of performance or abilities but from personal favors and relationships. THe environment is toxic and unprofessional.
bad,"Wells Fargo is a horrible place to bank or work. They don't appreciate their team members, they promote unprofessional people to manage others its a joke."
bad,"Took inbound customer service calls for credit card customers.  Checked balances, relationship with the bank.  Sold banking products like money market accounts etc."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Prefer not to say minimal advancement lack of encouragement, perception is everything. No one adds value they only subtract. Management plays favoritism heavily."
bad,"Poor management and terrible work culture.  There is no way to obtain sales goals and no matter how good of job you do, the management will find ways to make you feel worthless.  The management there is a revolving door, so stay far away from this place."
bad,"Wells Fargo, when I worked there, was very cut throat. There was no collaboration, no communicating and it always seemed like there was no morale. I don't miss it at all."
bad,"I worked at Wells Fargo for about 4 1/2 years and it was a horrible experience.   They don't like to promote qualified people for management jobs - Instead, they promote people based on gender and race whether or not they are qualified or not.   The two people that I worked for there are prime examples of that.  They were only in those positions because they were a certain gender and race NOT because of any expertise they tried to say they had.   Also, when things went bad which they often did, they would hide behind that status."
bad,"Incompetent and poor management they do not care about employees. I would not recommend employment to anyone at all."
bad,The job sucked. Customers complained when you ask for Id and the overall work environment was not friendly. I would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"Wells Fargo is cut throat, you have to be ready to swim like a shark and produce like one to survive. If you didn't produce sale's, your manager will make sure to put you down in front of the whole staff for not reaching your goal.  Be ready for constant anxiety for sales. Best of luck!"
bad,"Lack of Management/ Support. "
bad,"If you enjoy a competitive sales environment, don't care that customers ignore you when you do a good job and then go psychotic on you when you make a mistake, if you can navigate an environment where you are trained to do things one way and then when you start working everyone tells you to do it a different way, this is the job for you!"
bad,"Do NOT DO.. simple as that.  If you value your morals, character, integrity and self respect, STAY away.  It is not worth it.  Tons of other banks to explore, that actually value customers not just frauding numbers and false checking accounts."
bad,100% do NOT recommend WF!!  Horrible management. Senior management especially. They only care about making a profit. They treat their employees and customers like garbage.
bad,"Mission-driven organization making a positive impact on a massive scale"
bad,"too much drama and poor management"
bad,"The management at Wells Fargo was not was I was accustomed to. There was rarely any support from the management team and I was left on my own to figure out the guidelines and the company software programs. The goals were very unrealistic,and the forced compliance audits on individuals were intimidating."
bad,"Remove the old computer equipment and replace with new updated computer systems."
bad,"a typical day here was very very hard"
bad,The general public assumes that you're as good as the company you work for & that goes for all the media scandals regarding all lines of business regarding this company.
bad,"Too much diversity, most managers don't know how to manage or don't do anything, production too much of a priority, not family friendly, people walk around like they don't have any work to do, work ethic does not exist."
bad,"Wells Fargo Home Mortgage in the Orlando, Florida area is plagued with manipulative and dishonest management. Most are truly unqualified; for example, processors with zero underwriting experience are placed as Team Leads over experienced underwriters. Their job is to placate loan officers while maintaining an assembly line atmosphere for underwriters."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"As a Mortgage Loan officer, it is not a great place to be. The processing and the underwriters work slow. The guidelines are strict and the pricing is horrible. They don't want to close business there."
bad,wasted my time working there. dead end job tried to get me to relocate to promote. closed the entire division glad i left the company. only positive thing was volunteer work thru company.
bad,"Iam dissapointed i invested 2 years of my life there. A job is just a job here no one who has your interest in mind to help you succeed. Poor management who do nothing to get you prepared for the next role, but alot to critiseize you for trying to move on"
bad,They do NOT have their employees best interests in mind. They promise you the world and nothing is ever in writing for a reason. The HR department is horrilbe
bad,"this company I will not give positive feedback for due to personal things and things the company did. no one should work for this company, they don't treat their employee's well."
bad,Not a good company culture.  Way too much pressure on the sales people and constant meetings and training. People were treated like a number and no thought was given to quality of life.
bad,"Constantly in customers' personal business trying to get them to open more accounts with Wells Fargo.  It was not about providing excellent customer service, it was about opening more accounts any way you could."
bad,big mistake when i took this job. the managers are beyond bad. i  don't have words to explain it. they don't care about the employee or the customers.
bad,"The saying ""Its who you know"" is very relevant to this company and that's saying a lot.  I do not want to belittle the company as a whole, but in the department I am in, its very stressful and the workplace culture is by far nothing I am accustom to.  I can only say this about one department."
bad,"Poor management, low minimum pay, no room for career growth, lateral internal promotion no more then 12% at a time. No training support................................"
bad,"Extremely stressful, not a pleasant atmosphere. Too much upselling of unnecessary products and services. Lots of verbal punishment if you didn't sell enough products in a day."
bad,This company is closed.  There is no need for this review however it is a required field.  I do not have anything to say being that the organization no longer exists.
bad,"I honestly didn't care for the corporate structure nor the syndicates that were build within the walls of the company. Great company in the 1800's, far from its structure now."
bad,Answer calls in a timely manner. Assist members with account information. Upsell members on products they could use to their banking advantage while keep member satisfaction at an all time high.
bad,"Very stressful.  no work-life balance.  They only care if you produce.  Managers sits in their offices all day and do nothing.  Technology is advanced, but leadership can use a lot of training."
bad,Overall it's going to be pros and cons everywhere I just think each situation is different and my phone personal opinion shouldn't effect the discretion of this company.
bad,I honestly did not like working as a teller at wells fargo. I felt like they wanted us to lie to customers and offer them accounts they did not need and that was horrible.
bad,Liers and cheats again they told me I would be a bonus for the people I did their taxes for but they didn't give me it due to something stupid I hated it
bad,"Wells Fargo only cares about their top share holders. Do not assume they care about you as an employee. They do not. I repeat, they do not care about you as an employee, nor will they ever. It's all about the 1% and making them more money."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"No value for human life, compensation, or long-term advancement. Pay was seen as extreme burden and hardship and not given generously to meet team members needs for market expense to live and have any work/life balance."
bad,Poor management that just turns a blind eye to issues. Service manager will get personal with you if you stand up for your right! dealing with bullies here
bad,"This is one of the worst jobs I ever had.  The management was horrible and there was a racist manager that did unfair things to employees according to the color of their skin.  She was very passive aggressive and would use other managers to do her ""dirty work"" for her. I would not recommend anyone to work in the Financial Crimes Investigations Dept. at Wells Fargo."
bad,"Never ever ever work for Wells Fargo, they will set you up and make you feel like the most important person on earth there and then once you follow commands given to you they will try to fire you for fraud."
bad,"Wells Fargo is making a lot of changes after all the negative media attention due to the cutthroat sales culture, but the changes instituted a year ago left team members making 20-30% less money than before, and everyone is miserable. Very negative environment"
bad,"Working at Wells Fargo was horrible and I would not recommend it to anyone. I worked there before its public financial issues came to light, and I can say first hand the organizations was pushing employees to do unethical banking practices to meet business goals."
bad,"bad company with pathetic work culture. should avoid this at any cost. ruined my career. no fte positions available, only contact ones. no notice, simply kicked out"
bad,There is nothing about this place that I would recommend for someone to work. Wells Fargo don't make the workplace fair for their employees. It's all about numbers and if you don't meet their requirements then you don't have a job.
bad,Such a terrible company to work for  ridiculous sales quota for a bank not to mention that the traffic was so slow and there was little accountability
bad,i really didnt like working at wells fargo in california there was alot of pressure sales everything they do is so wrong manager will bully the employees its all politics if they dont like dont expect to move up in the company
bad,Corrupted upper management. Terrible turnover. Understaffed all the time. Customers trying to take advantage of bank burning.  No stable scheduling. No promises kept. The bank is upside down. Run!!!!
bad,They will train you and let you go. Do not give this opportunity a chance go somewhere else and I would not trust them with my account less alone employment
bad,"High volume and fast pace environment, low salary wages, poor management and on hands training. Would not recommend this company. Company always laying off departments."
bad,Wells Fargo offers poor compensation for more work. It's ridiculous how much work you do for $15/hour its highway robbery. The company as a whole is good for teenagers.
bad,"After working for years at Wells Fargo, I can say that the lack of leadership from upper management has driven the successful and hard-working individuals to look for jobs elsewhere. HR is equally at fault for mismanaging cases on an every-day basis and exposing information to upper management that should have remained confidential. "
bad,Collectors and manager called consumers and released info to 3rd parties and threatened consumers with jail time if they did not return vehicles that were out for repo.
bad,"I got hired on with this company through a hiring agency. At first it seemed like it would be a good fit, but then the management became really over-attentive. And it was a lot of work that didn't feel like we were getting compensated enough."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,The internship I had with Wells Fargo was enjoyable and very short. I mostly watched the teller working and learned from them. It was not hand on internship. It was boring because all I was doing was fixing up the desks and supporting the employees
bad,No communication. They lie instead of telling you the truth. Terrible pay.  There is a lack of communication between everyone there. You can be working on something and 50 people will be involved but they just don't know it. They treat you like you're trash. No type of respect.
bad,Poor management. Because of the lawsuit upper management refused to help the mortgage department get referrals from the branch. We were doubled up as loan officers per branch which made it a cut throat culture.
bad,Horrible leadership!  Leads lack work ethic once promoted.  No discipline since they are related to family members.   Managers afraid to fire those.  No role models to follow here.   You wonder why customers talk to us the way they do.   Managers are ruthless.
bad,working for wells Fargo was very stressful.  they would not work around family or personal life.  the management is untrained and some dont even know how banking works.
bad,"Poor management, unorganized organizational structure, no proper trainings were provided. The job was low paid and overloaded. There was very high turn over ratio in the work place. The longest person worked for the department I was belong was a recent college grad who only worked for this company for three years. Had to handle so many customer complains daily some screams and yelled at me since services previous administrators provided them were so poor and kept doing trouble shooting everyday. Some employees were so frustrated and hostile due to overloaded work with low paid.  Job performances were evaluated by managers' favoritisms.  You get maltreatment and abuses when managers and their friends don't like you."
bad,Very stressful place to work. Not helping clients its all about the money. worst years .they lost all the good employees.The leaders were not helping they adding stress.
bad,"Managers play favorites!  They say it's easy to move up in the company but only if you have proper management.  Being a teller is one of the easiest jobs a student can have but Wells Fargo made life very difficult for no reason and they don't stick up for their employees.  Also if starting as a teller you have to start as part time and in order to move up in the company or even be full time, you have to interview all over again for the position.  Easy if you have good management and people rooting for you.  Difficult if you have horrible management and managers wanting to see you fail"
bad,"great this is a great place to work, great health insurance, great benefits. I would recommend any one to apply for a positions. They would love it as I do."
bad,"Company has no business integrity, work ethics, or structure to avoid fraudulent sales practices.  The sales culture of Wells Fargo is far worst then what’s reflected on the media.  If you are not an affluent client, you are considered “trash” as they call it among themselves.  I will never work for them again, or care to work for them ever again."
bad,Wells Fargo pushed it's employees to the breaking point just to make a dollar. This company should be ashamed of itself. The sales practices that were pushed upon the staff were criminal.
bad,"after seeing several outstanding employees cycle through the company, even though employees customer service skills were outstanding, their cross selling skills failed to meet the Wells Fargo minimums,  it was apparent Wells Fargo goals had nothing to do with customer satisfaction. finally law suits and fraud claims have hopefully put their culture in a more positive direction? who knows?"
bad,bad work hours bad pay. never get days off.  always under staffed.  mostly under staffed because they do not pay well.  never move up in company unless you know someone in management. don't do it!
bad,Apart from giving me my first opportunity to work in the USA when I moved from England this experience was a poor one. I did get to learn the US banking system but Wells Fargo was too obessed with selling products to customers that did not need them. Even to the point of class action law suits against them.
bad,"Job was data entry. Left due to long commute, low pay, limited opportunities for advancement. Sought more interesting work in a more interesting company."
bad,"Management is unprofessional, and not understanding at all. Team is also underpaid. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to apply or work for this company, most locations are full of unprofessional management and shady business."
bad,"When Wachovia Bank was purchased by Wells Fargo..... our world crumbled in a matter of no time.  The stress and work environment was horrific."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work at Wells Fargo. Same way they treated customers is same way they treated employees. Pressure to sale for incentives that could never be met
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"i learned about faced pace customer service, cash vault, business accounts and managing bankers and tellers, opening new accounts and closing and opening branch."
bad,It's crazy when it comes to sales they say it's not there priority but that's totally false. They cut that part out of our incentives but they still require we sell and it's insane when everyone knows about the law suite
bad,"This Wachovia  job was a temporary job position, never intending to be a permanent job here.  I went on to work at Republic Mortgage Insurance Company."
bad,"would work from opening to close would have to stay two hours after closing and would hardly ever day get a day off, would have to eat standing up while working most of the time."
bad,Wells Fargo Advisors is the worst place I've ever worked.  They give you no guidance on training and when you ask for assistance while learning a new form or overall work you are told to Google it.  Management cares nothing about it's employee's and only about padding their own pockets.
bad,"it was ok, lack of advancement and growth, I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there if they are trying to grow and move up in the company its lackluster"
bad,"Wells Fargo is a machine. It eats people and spits them out with little of no regard for the results. There will always be another client. There will always be another ""cog"" to jam in place when an employee leaves after being crushed."
bad,The department I work in has very poor communication when it comes to management. Everyone is not treated equally. The manager runs the department likes a dictator and not to Wells Fargo standards.
bad,Worst company I've every worked for. Dishonest. Liars. Manipulating. Unmotivating. Horrible. Thieves. Careless. Devil. I wish this company would cease to exist.
bad,"mid management passes poor quality assessment and bank inconsistencies to lower management"
bad,your job is never secure here they are always hiring and firing. They hire on people for more then what you make the management sucks. people act like they are in high school there
bad,Most of my time with wells Fargo I loved my job.  Management is Getting bad and they are hiring managers with no experience.  Workplace culture is bad. Management shows favoritism. Many employees are unhappy.  Wells Fargo is weeding out the wrong people. Moral is low
bad,Everyone had to fend for them self. Our morning meeting were simply reminders that if we did not perform we did not keep our jobs. I love the job just not the threats.
bad,My position was to contact Government offices to find out the property taxes for homes that were to be foreclosed on by Wells Fargo.  How easy it was to get that information.  Management was not easy to work for and very hard to talk to.  The culture was very cut throat and hard to concentrate.  The hardest part was not knowing what was expected of you.  The most enjoyable part is hard to say except when I gave my notice.
bad,"Horrible manager that played favorites, bitter and very mean. Was retiring soon so didn't really care about anything except sales numbers. Preferred females, constantly put males down when a referral was not achieved."
bad,"I don't think that Wells Fargo is the worse place to work, but it is the worse place to work in Alamogordo, New Mexico.  Employees and management are very immature, and lack professionalism.  No room for advancement unless you join the right clique."
bad,"Responsible for all internal accounting , functions including disbursement , balancing and reporting to meet expectations. Worked under minimal supervision."
bad,"Stressful, and unethical. I watched cheaters prosper and hard workers get let go. It seems that they may have temporarily fixed some of the problems, but they will come back. We had conference calls hourly, you got in trouble for doing things ethically, and the only people who survive are either drunk on KoolAid, or sleeping with their superior."
bad,This company requires you to work overtime. Does not pay you very well. Management is lacking on all levels and they are not organized and scheduled at all/
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,A typical day at work. What you learned. management. workplace culture. the hardest part about your job. The most enjoyable part of your job. Review guidelines.
bad,"worst place in the word. They do not care about their employees only numbers. You are a slave to the job 6 days a week, No accountability. Poor management and lack of employee benefits."
bad,Wells Fargo Advisors doesn't practice what they preach about helping customers.  I noticed that a lot of the long term employees spoke down about customers.
bad,"Do not work here.  first, they interviewed others right in front of me. (I had a contract). Then they did not bother to ask me or encourage me to apply for the open positions. The team went to lunch without inviting me along. I was invited once. Then, I was accused of something I did not do. I was not treated well for 6 months. Pay is good. One star."
bad,"Your given a job and trained - for that position on their software"
bad,"Very Low pay, Feel like your just a number. Poor morale, unapproachable environment, Management does not really care what the employee wants, just pump out the work, and make one mistake and they will treat you like you  as if you have not done a great job for the last 10 years. They could cut you off in a second and not think twice."
bad,"Very bad work experience."
bad,"I started as a temp in helping the transition from First Interstate Bank to Wells Fargo Bank. Then I worked in the department that corrected account errors. However they tried to move the department from Concord California to Phoenix, but nobody wanted to relocate to Phoenix, so we lacked proper training."
bad,I did not like it there. Terrible culture almost like high school clicks.  People had to suck up to management and be treated like children just to keep their job.
bad,answered phones.. advised home owners of short sale process.. advised what papers they need to submit..  answered any questions I could to help home owner save there homes
bad,"Too many work politics. Hard work, but must brown nose to move up. Basic 8-4, or 9-5 schedule. Compensation is little to nothing. Would not recommend to anyone else."
bad,unless i sold a ton of credit cards and savings or checking accounts you were treated poorly. consistently required to sell credit cards even if the customer didn't need it.
bad,This financial institution has now merged with Wells Fargo which as we know have their own set of issues that are representative of Wachovia Bank's culture.
bad,"Wells Fargo does customers badly, just as they also do to employees. Wells Fargo likes to lure you in then have you do five jobs for one man without the proper compensation and fabrication of incentives. Despite any situation when you call employee relations and/or human resources, while management fabricates and manipulates, you are looked at as the one in the wrong, when you're not. You can do all of is expected of you and for years try to get promoted but unless you're favored you will not get anywhere, although in fact while you're doing a superb job, Wells Fargo does not look at your 5 man job you did for them so with all your experiences with this company and your great past background from other jobs and education, is gone. Management's personal behaviors make or break your performance depending on the day per month, and your merit increase, and over all outlook of others due to false allegations. Management like to claim that you don't like your job or even put on behalf of Wells Fargos name an injunction of harassment when they lied about you. Even while they are still in the media and suites are going. Very horrible place, breaks my heart how they treat people.  As far as personal banking. As also a former customer now,  Wells Fargo dealer services is also in suit. In addition with violating many laws in which I was also a victim of their harmful tactics in this manner as well. I also had my personal money in,  from Wells Fargo Bank checking account all of a sudden missing and the tellers and managers had no clue where or how it disappeared although they could see"
bad,"Worked out of a bank branch. Started out great. Loved working with people and striving to me meet goals for advancement. Bumped to a personal banker after11 months. Management played favorites, struggled to meet expectations that were unrealistic. Accused of things that never happened. Pushed until I quit."
bad,I was there during the scandal. We all know how that went.   They definitely push us to make sales and open accounts. The bonuses were for how many accounts one opened during a certain period of time.
bad,"I can't speak to working for Wells Fargo.  The company I worked for was WFS Financial located in Irving with a corporate office in Irvine, CA.  Good company to start out while in college."
bad,My experience while working with Wachovia was exciting because everyone there was a team player and they knew their purpose too. I loved to come to work everyday.
bad,Loved working for Wachovia. Wells Fargo took over and I couldn't agree with there ethics & morals.  No longer enjoyed doing what I loved everyday.....
bad,this job was repetative and was great second job. the management was great and they took care of their employees they also offered benefits for part time employees
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,I've already reviewed wells fargo! i dont understand why this website is making me do it again. I disliked working there and i would never go back to that company.
bad,"WFHM did desk share and required very odd daily hours.  The company is notorious for reverse discrimination.  Even though policies advise against bullying and retaliation they do this frequently (via management) and HR overlooks this.  This was a horrible place of employment, even down to VP attempting to ruin my life after layoff."
bad,"Worst company to work for."
bad,Don't ever work for this company. You never know what your going to be doing or when your going to be out of a job. There's no job security at this place.
bad,"Very competitive environment among employees. Management doesn't care about career advancement opportunities for employees. No coaching, training or development."
bad,Toxic work environment with little pay and even less benefits. You don't exist until after a year of working. Unrealistic expectations set by management.
bad,Make sure you ready the fine print. It was not a very comfortable environment. Very unprofessional environment no room for growth. Not willing to work with your schedule
bad,This company does not pay fair nor do they address employee needs or concerns. Not a relaxed environment at all. Older employees are pushed to retire while younger employees are hired that have no work ethics.
bad,"I use to work part time at wells as a Equipment Operator at the CIC building in Charlotte, its Horrible there. Management is horrible.. team leads are also. I wouldn't recommend no one to work in this department maybe someone right out of high school cause this is the type of behavior that works there.  They micro manage like you are a kindergarten.  I CANT!! and didn't."
bad,Wells Fargo is VERY hard to work for at to work at. The management is not so good and does not care about anything besides you hitting your sales goals.
bad,This was a temporay assignment. I did not enjoy the position. There was no prior training.  I was clueless as what to do. The help was minimal. I was thrown on the phone with very little assistance as how to direct the calls.
bad,"Worked there for 5 years.  Although the standard benefits are good, the pay is low - which is the same for morale, and management is an absolute ""cluster"".  They work you like a rented mule, find every way possible to take away bonuses (regardless of how much you produce and how well you do your job), they also micro manage you to death.  There is no reward for loyalty, hard work, and sacrifice.  You earn every penny you work for, and management acts like they are the ones doing you a favor having you work mandatory overtime with no consideration for work-life balance."
bad,"My work experience with Wells Fargo was okay.  My only gripe is that they are inconsistent and have many displacements. It was nice to be able to work from home, but there were lots of closed door meetings and you knew that a layoff was coming very soon."
bad,"This company has had very poor press and deservedly so. The worst corporate work environment I have ever worked in. forcing products on clients who did not ask for them. It was like selling socks there... All volume, without regard for clients or employee needs."
bad,Communication is pretty much nonexistent and no real answers ever provided. Recruiters rude and turn around for them seems to be high so you never with the same person more than a month or two f they still work there.
bad,"Worst company to work."
bad,target made some bad decisions and now current employees are paying for it. each employee is wearing multiple hats to keep the job and work life balance.
bad,"great place to work. I would not have left, but I could not turn down the additional money especially with getting married and trying to get pregnant. I would go back."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Work environment was decent.  I only worked their for two months before being let go per the nationwide closing of our branch of the business.  Training was pretty good and job consisted of all cold calls.  Issue was we were all calling the same people and it seemed like I was being fed left overs that more senior people could not get closed.
bad,Wells Fargo works you to death and does not pay you enough for the amount of time that you need to put in. I was only able to stand them treating me like that for a few months before I had to find something else.
bad,There was very little structure when I worked for this company. It can get very chaotic and stressful. They do not pay you enough for all of the stress you will take in while working for the company.
bad,Although I was able to advance a bit it was very hard and limited. Becoming a lead took several sales quarters of meeting high sales demands. Did not wish to continue employment here.
bad,"The job became very stressful, competitive and the goals set became unattainable. The management practiced unfair preferential treatment to some people. I worked in Clackamas, Or."
bad,"Lots of pressure to sell sell sell, no one knows what they are talking about and leading people into terrible financial places. Very difficult to meet expectations."
bad,"I didn't find the business model very effective to attract and retain customers."
bad,"I could not stand the management of Wells Fargo.  They are all crooks and only care about making money, no matter what the cost.  They do not care for their employees or customers"
bad,Unimpressed with management and how things are managed seems like there is a lot of wasted time. Work is not consistent and not always sent in correctly again management is not good
bad,Low pay and few raises .There is very little room for advancement. Very little room for growth. I would not recommend this employer. Most companies pay double their salaries.
bad,All about sales goals and if you don't get any you get yelled at they even create there own wells fargo homework a big pack due once a week and training how to sell products and role plays on products you know that is not good for the customer but they are so heartless you have to get your whole family to open accounts for sales if you are not getting customers to do so I would come home everyday feeling bad for the customers and upset I never felt proud of myself I was always stressed and in a bad mood when I would come home do not work here they are completely selfish! they don't see the knowledge in you they only look at the sales side. I never got a full hour lunch never because I was at such a small branch all the time a quick 10min lunch. sometimes Nothing at all.
bad,"Not sure why this is necessary, my experience at this company is confidential, and should have no importance on my new job search, don't feel comfortable with this required response"
bad,"Absolute toxic culture. Would never recommend to my worst of nemesis. Everything you see on the news is correct. Arrogant, coked-up management and grueling punishment for messing up."
bad,Never cared about employees it was always about the store numbers ! I personally took a lunch maybe 1-2 a week short staff at all times and salary manager took 2hr lunches !
bad,"management terrible, company terms ur U4 when u hand in resignation just to spite u. jobs overregulated/impossible/scripted. company in turmoil.Awful!"
bad,"Management is there because of who they know not what they know.  Very poor pay; the longer you stay at Wells Fargo, the less you will be paid.  Culture is horrible."
bad,Does not take care of their employees. Has no problem just getting rid of great employees. I would not suggest working for this company. I have no been looking outside of the company to find a better culture of a company.
bad,"The company Wells Fargo is very greedy and they only care about one thing, which sales quotas being met. They love you when your numbers are high and as soon as they start to drop they will drop you."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Transacting business for customers..Daily interacting with customers,balancing cash drawer,continually learning ways to excel in customer service..Learning ways to advance my career ."
bad,Very unprofessional environment.  Run like a ma and pa shop.  President set the unprofessional tone of the company.  He was  demoted during the time that I worked there.
bad,Very stressful environment with unethical principles. I am glad to hear that the company is improving but I was not able to sacrifice my integrity for the position I held.
bad,No effort to see the employees succeed.  Managers primarily interested in their own advancement.  Other folks may have had better experiences but I was not happy.
bad,The employees are pushed to meet unreasonable time frames.  When I applied the job description didn't indicate that employees are standing for the complete shift except for breaks and lunch.
bad,"Busy all day..."
bad,"Mismanaged.   Everything incredibly lax.   People come and go at work as they please.  Most come into the office once a week.  Poor communication, low pay."
bad,"I was a collector, and even when you collected on calls, your manager went over calls, and would tell you what you should have done different. Very stressful."
bad,they don't pay anything. no benefits or you can't afford them. I have nothing really to say about this temp service. it is what it is. they suck. its a temp fix until you can find a permanent position
bad,I would not work at this bank. They were not very customer friendly and the pay was one of the worst in the industry. The sales culture is very product pushy and not about what best for the client.
bad,"How to read and review accounts create work orders, and assist callers with customer service and information regarding there mortgage account and or directing them to the correct department. The hardest part of the job is learning out to read and fully understand the loan account and the status."
bad,"politics at this place are unbelievable...the culture is not where it needs to be..there's limited to no upward mobility available for people of color...all upper management are of Caucasian decent...very racist in nature and the only way to rise up is to know someone else...i worked here for 5 years, went out on STD and returned to be fired within 5 days... this place is the devil..beware"
bad,Horrible place to work. Always about how many services each teller could assist in adding to accounts and customer service was not a concern. Money condition was horrible.
bad,"Any Wells Fargo location I've been at, I have seen managers on amazon/ebay for most of their work. Once normal employees turn into managers all of their production stops. Each manager has a best friend in the business and that is how they move up."
bad,Did like the way The job was presented and how it actually was. A typical day consisted of taking care of the customers however you had to sale additional things to them on every single call.
bad,"Manager never shows up to work no assistance in putting in loans and you are expected to contact 10 realtors a week but the catch is the manager who is never at work (most of the time) is supposed to call the 10 people you made sales call to and check to see why they haven't sent you any loans.  Atmosphere is depressing and manager is inadequate at the managerial role. "
bad,"I would never suggest a friend or family member work at this bank. Shady managers, shady workers and bad work environment. They do not have the best interest of the customer and are all about sales, sales and more sales."
bad,"At first it was a really fun place to work at, but after the new manager started everything went bad. We also got robbed. Very dangerous. They don't care about their employees, they only care about sales."
bad,"Cons"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,After what I have learned working at Wells Fargo I would never ever work for them again and they are still in the news for wrongfully foreclosing on those poor people.
bad,"even if you get hired as a customer service rep, you are doing sales. they push sales extremely hard. its un organized so if you ever need a manager you literally just stand there waiting for a manager to recocgnize that you need help"
bad,"Company Focused on sales, don't care about customers. Managers are incompetent. Trainings are focused on sales not product knowledge.  A lot of discrepancies when it comes to ethics."
bad,store manager physically chase me to the car when i was going for lunch. she has mental and anger management problems. she gets very weird mood swings. i am so happy i no longer work with her. she needs to take her bi-polar medication so she won't snap at people.
bad,It was very difficult to work for a company that was so selfish in there ways. They would ask you to work way longer than you should and if for some reason you had a sick child or family emergency they would never allow the time off
bad,"unreasonable demands were placed upon bankers to provide each ""customer"" with at least 8"" products.  branches were called ""stores"" and we were forced to shove all of our products down the customers throat whether they needed it or not"
bad,My supervisor when i worked at wells Fargo only cared about sales and how much her bonus could be. No wonder they had a huge sales issue when encouraging and rewarding people like this. wells Fargo made it impossible to give customers the customer care i was supposedly hired for.
bad,Wells Fargo is a company who is all about money and their benefits. Wells Fargo do not  care about their employees. Wells Fargo is unfair and do not treat everyone the same way when it comes to policies and procedures.
bad,Unreliable Job. No job advancement opportunities.  People get laid off randomly without warning. They do give employees PTO and free lunches.  But has a high stress level of being laid off on any given day.
bad,Not a good company to work for at all. they are extremly nosey and always up in everyones business the supervisors do not look to help there employees at all
bad,Wells Fargo is a low paying sressful company. Promotion opportunities are chosen by favoritisim and ethnicity. The company has a high turn over rate. They do not show appreciation to employees
bad,"Days would be full of reviewing reports, being on calls with management to discuss various topics.  Unfair treatment of team members and long work days with late lunches"
bad,Skills were not utilized/work was not appreciated/management was not helpful/everyone left my group/co-workers compared it to being on 'The Truman Show'.
bad,"they sure know how to over work you and then make you feel unappreciated for your hard work and time they would like your time to revolve around their world and then not compensate you for it. they also love to talk about the work culture but, have none."
bad,Wachovia was not a good place to work and will never recommend anyone to work there. I did enjoy working there when it was First Union though. Not a good working environment.
bad,"I was asked to do things that I felt were ethically inappropriate and when I voiced my concerns about it, I was punished for it.  They were originally working with my health issues, but when I stated that I was uncomfortable with some of their requests, I was dismissed."
bad,"This bank is only interested in sales for them.  If you con people into opening accounts versus succeeded financially, you will do great here.  if you are more interested in customer service and helping people, this is the wrong place to work."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Managens non technical.They get hired by support from peers,they don't know anything,Notice period 3 months.Employer pf also get cut form salary.HR Worst.Too much politics.Employees also don't know anything.Not a place for talented individuals"
bad,"We have seen what the company has gone thru in the last couple years. No need to explain. 500 people, inclucding me, were laid off in one day without any warning"
bad,"Sadly the company is a great organization but the employees and the environment is not all that its cut out to be. The managers are not helpful at all. the Employees are rude and don't speak even if you speak to them. I hate to say that racism still exists, oh but it does. I have never dealt with such a large host of unprofessional individuals. I would not recommend family, friends or colleagues to their BPS department if they owned their own business."
bad,"My typical day at work, was doing all my managers work. I learned how to be extremely efficient and how to deliver professional customer service. The work environment was okay, not the best. Upper management sucked, but nice people in the branch."
bad,"Place is a meat grinder. Typical old fashioned IB mentality that there is a line stretching around the corner for each seat, and everyone currently in those seats is disposable. Would never work here again."
bad,"Horrible sales culture, I almost did not want to work in banking anymore after working at wells fargo. Clients are awesome!!!! History of being consistent"
bad,No good place to work never had a supervisor or if we get one quit right away very poor management not care for the employees at all nothing more to said very bad  area to work for wells fargo
bad,Had access to training yet never had the time to complete because of so much work.  Employees were constantly looking for better positions due to unhappiness in their role
bad,Negative Publications in the media. High pressure sale. Manager is corrupt. I would not recommend. Too many lawsuits pending. Partnerships have backed out and their own loyal customers are no longer wanting to invest with the company. Very hostile work environment
bad,Worked with spreadsheets daily and projects. Learned a lot about agricultural products. Management was great. Culture very laid back and nice. Trying to get more work. Enjoyable was the different thing is worked on and learned.
bad,"I worked 5 years for Wells Fargo, at first the experience was amazing and then you start learning all the cons regarding how mediocre the management really is, ethics behind the company is tainted."
bad,"you have to clock out to use the restroom. they try to keep you trapped in your current role even though they sold all of the opportunities for advancement (""we will put you wherever you want to go after one year in this role!"")"
bad,Worst company to work for after what they did to customers and they are currently under federal investigation. They don't care about customers nor are they focused on customer service. A typical day would be logging into my computer and talking to customers and telling customers they cant bank with Wells Fargo anymore because they committed fraud against the bank. Management was horrible and so was the training.
bad,"management will lie to your face in order to fill a position.  They will promise you the sun, moon, and stars.  However, once you start they go back on there word."
bad,terrible place hard to use the bathroom very controlled environment everything is a write up pay is terrible beyond stressful and management was horrible good luck
bad,"The building is filthy, over 100 employees were attacked by bedbugs, management uses the department allowance for their own personal use like gas in their car and as always, it;s all politics"
bad,"intimidation is the norm mediocre management and blatant corruption  are part of Wells Fargo core values."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,the management there was the absolute worst. they made bad decisions based on feelings and not facts. be wary of false friendships.
bad,My time there was a horrible one. Im so glad I left. The managers there DO NOT CARE about the people. They only cared about their paychecks and how to grow them.
bad,"This is not a place of employment, it is a recognition with Wells Fargo. Not sure why this was placed as a job, it does not exist, nothing more to be said"
bad,Everything you're hearing  is true!  They don't care about the employees or the customers. Management knows what's going on. All the way to the top!   I don't even bank with them.
bad,"Overall a corrupt company, just look at the news on any given week"
bad,"Volitaile and lazy people there. Insecure, game playing losers."
bad,"Hired on as a Contractor during the time where Wells purchased Wachovia or some other bank, I forget. They were converting all of those customers to Wells Fargo customers so there was alot of Support needed. We were essentially Online Bankers and Advisers. The Leadership was horrible, the Company treated Contract Employees horrible. Of all the contract jobs I've ever taken on, this was by far the worst experience. They would bring Candy carts around for all the Employees; working overtime and bypass Contractor Desks. They did Catered Food Events for Employees on mandatory overtime but would not allow Contractors access to the benefits. Yet Contractors were pulling a big majority of those mandatory overtime hours. The company agenda was to Sell Sell Sell - even if dealing with a customer who was having financial trouble, sell sell sell that mortgage or credit card. Terrible experience and I'll never be a Wells Fargo member because of it."
bad,excellent working place area and excellent place to work with and more time engagement. more engagement with  people and other community services
bad,They push you so much with sales managers are constantly telling you to do un ethical stuff and when you do they wont back you up and HR doesn't care. Wells Fargo culture is known to open multiple accounts for customers and they don't care if they get overdraft fees. I left the company when everything started to get out of control and ill go home feeling guilty about my day.
bad,"Every time I hear one of my friends interviewing there, I tell them not to.  They will chew you up and spit you out. I started there when they were First Union, went thru all the mergers with a smile on my face,  We were told that they would not get rid of the old Wachovia people....the were dropping like flies. They have no loyalty to their employees as they like to make people think,  I was there 14 years.  I know"
bad,"Team was severely understaffed for 5+ years. Supervisor would call it job security. Each investigator was assigned over 60+ cases at a time & was told that the normal case volume was 30. It was next to impossible to hire internally due to supervisor's reputation. "
bad,This position is a front line position. you are the first line of contact with customers. The Teller position involves working with customers to provide them with excellent customer service.
bad,"Sales and only sales. You either sell or you are not worth anything."
bad,"I helped mortgage holders with their billing questions, and helped them stay in their homes if they were facing financial issues."
bad,This bank is good for a person who is first entering the workforce but not someone who is an experienced professional. Your co-workers are friendly but the management needs to learn a new concept of loyalty to both the company and employees.
bad,the employees were very mean and un-professional. and the training was not very hands on which left most of us that were recently hired very confused and needing extra help from our managers.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,annonymous. wells fargo can be challenging at times. management is not consistent. it is never enough
bad,"Wells Fargo is defined by a culture where paper never meets reality. They say that they know their employees and customers are important; however, they create policies that are fully against both. "
bad,"A typical day is putting out fires started by other people, every one seems to have their own view on numbers, and correlating them is a nightmare."
bad,"There is no job security, no bonus is easy to get, no part time available, they don't let you do overtime unless you are exceeding their expectations. One thing is right one week, but changes the next. They hire external people for jobs they know nothing about."
bad,Terrible terrible company to work for. Worst culture ever. Management is clueless they come out of McDonalds as dishwashers to Directors at Wells Fargo
bad,"Great diverse place to  work. No call is every the same when on the phones.   Wells Fargo encourages  employees also to move up the corporate  ladder."
bad,"marketing, project management and more. As a result of rapid growth, we are searching for skilled applicants who share our values of quality and outstanding service. We are open to candidates from across North America or Europe."
bad,"The people there were amazing to work with, I enjoyed my supervisors company, as well as my teammates. Upper management were very rude. Their expectations are absolutely ridiculous. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for them."
bad,"Worst Company Ever. Unethical sales, cold calling to customers past business hours.  Managers appear helpful but are very shady and only look out for themselves.  They preach about service but haven't figured out how to implement exceptional service."
bad,I was a top performer when it comes to putting applications in.  The problem is that we worked with a best balance score.  Meaning that if you where off on anyone of the scores they would deduct pay.  I was a mortgage consultant but for some reason they did put more towards putting loans in.  They just went to this audit score system which only would review two loans a month.  Last month I did 40 so if they chose on of them and I did something incorrect then I would be deducted on my best balance score.
bad,"Don't work here unless you plan on starting a career here. Management are constantly breathing down your neck to get sales and do well with survey scores. Thus, the high turnover rate which adds more to your stressful day."
bad,"*Answering phone calls and helping costumers"
bad,"the could do better with how they conduct their business with their employees. nut overall I loved my job and the people I have worked with in the past. I wish things could've different, but you can't help who is in charge at the time."
bad,Wells Fargo was initially the place to be employed but is now going down hill. I have been here 6 years and have rolled with the punches but I'm now ready to try something different.
bad,"Wells Fargo is one of the worst companies to work far. High retention amongst other things support my claim. I worked at wells for seven years since graduating high school and can't believe I stayed as long as I did. All they care about is numbers and no matter how long you've been there you're replaceable. If you want daily stress, no job security, rude upper management-then work here!"
bad,"Poor pay, sales job, not a professional financial position by any means.  Quotas, not quality, are the rule here. Every aspect of this job is driven by ""What have you done for me lately?!?"""
bad,"the pressure to hit numbers makes this a tough place to work."
bad,"10 years behind the rest of the market. Out of touch, untrained, fear-based management. Very depressing work environment."
bad,"The goals are overwhelming and they promote unethical behaviors then act like they didn't. They talk out of both sides of their mouth. They don't care about their employees or customers, just what they can get out of each. I wouldn't recommend working here to my worst enemy!"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"No work/ life balance."
bad,They hire you as a tempoary employee knowing have no experience with loans. No training at all for five weeks. Just to try to do the job the best you can.  Then they are upset with your performance with no training or feedback. Management is terrible all they care about is themselves. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage has a huge problem keeping employees and it comes down to terrible management.
bad,"There is nothing good to say about this place. The pay is bad, the people are bad, all they care about is sales and making money. Customer's best interest is never in mind."
bad,"I sued and won $15,000 over my commission check because they put me on final corrective action for opening up a fraudulant checking account for a customer, when I had no clue that is was fraudulant and we never received training to recognize fake checks. They are criminals and you will be just a number and they do not care whatsoever."
bad,Poor management.Lack of respect for employees. Turnover rate very high.Always short staff. Company only do whats convenient  for company. All positions are sale related. Stay away from SUMMERVILLE MAIN!!!!
bad,i think that this is a boring company that makes me think that we will have to know that it is all about money and it is about getting more from the customer and not giving them anything.
bad,"low pay for industry. "
bad,Management does not do their job. Newbies are treated like exploited interns. Many promises are made during the initial group interview and even during training bu the reality is something else. There is no advancement in your role unless you know someone. There is way too much push for products and sales. If a customer is not giving all their money to wells there is nothing bankers can do to help. Managers do not assume their roles. Feels like you are working at a fast food restaurant instead of a bank.
bad,"It has been a pleasure working at Wells Fargo, yet it is time for a change. It has been a good experience but at this time no room for upgrading."
bad,"wells fargo is always busy, everyday you go to work you will take a minimum of 95 calls a day! everyone wore sweet pants and hair in buns the supervisors always world get angry when you get a supervisor call. I didn't like working here"
bad,"Such a horrible Turnover here, Management stays for a very short time as well as other employees. almost always hiring someone new"
bad,"The management seems stressed which interned stressed the employees on the teams, there goals set were so out of reach and management job was to dangle incentives that were never met in order to get employees to push harder. This made for a bad work environment and that to me meant non productive."
bad,i worked here for years!! at this exact location. they cant keep tellers because there is no management and NO job security! they took away teller bonus initiatives by cutting them IN HALF> ALL in ALL i would NOT recommended WELLS FARGO to ANYONE unless your ready to be t work from 7am to 7 pm and have no happiness in your life because this store is AWFUL and will suck the life out of you. the management SUCKS people you work with SUCK just don't waste your time there is no possibility with this company they will lead you on and NEVER  deliver. there was NO enjoyable parts of the day. the even refused to let me have a lunch for three whole months when working 10 hours a day when we were short staffed. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. do i need to say it anymore. don't waste your time other banks are 100 million times better. WELLS FARGO SUCKS
bad,"This was an ok company to work for and I really, did like the bonus and the people where not so friendly. management was no so professional."
bad,Not a good company to work for. Very political and no room for advancement. Bank is VERY results driven and does not matter where you get your accounts from as long as you get them.
bad,"Terrible, the people i worked with were very fake and shallow Wells fargo cares more about customers than their employee's."
bad,I have worked for Wells Fargo for the better part of 10 years. I was on my way of moving up in the company until I came into a certain department. There were some issues that had came up in which I involved HR and it was sided with me. Then a week later they decided to let me go for leaving 2 minutes early and did not reflect on my time card. There was no warning and there was no awareness of this and my LM had approved my time cards.
bad,"Responsible for full cycle loan package/document handling from origination to set up of closing"
bad,not a good place for advancement. there are allot of politics and clicks. they are very behind in technology. management does not have the proper leadership or management skills and play favorites to certain employees.
bad,"If I could put a 0 star I would. They treat you like a number not a human being. They say it's a family environment, it's NOT. I have NEVER hated a job like I hated Wells Fargo. They don't actually take the time to solve the customers issues, it's all about rushing them off the phone to meet the numbers."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Very stressful work place. No place for advancement. supervisors are awful. Upper management never knows what is going on. Supervisors talk about their employees.
bad,"I had a great relation ship with this company while working as a consultant in USA for over 7.5 years, they understood the whole consulting business and made me feel comfortable."
bad,not enough staff and they set impossible sales goals for the bankers to meet. if you did not meet them you were slowly terminated. this was not my idea of banking. Very sad that this is what the banking industry has turned into.
bad,No organization. No training in this field. only has one employee who happens to be the owner. the pay is good but its a hard job for one person.
bad,"This is the worst company in the world. You will not be considered a human being by this company, they treat people like cattle, bring them in one and push the previous group out of the other door. Terrible, terrible, terrible."
bad,Production driven environment not built for much movement. Culture is not very inviting for people who actually want to learn and grow.
bad,There is no need for me to speak about working for Wells Fargo Advisors. Things simply did not work out so I resigned. Enough said.
bad,They only care about sales. Wells Fargo views everyone including their employees as a means to get more money. This was the most stressful work environment to which I've ever been subjected. Morning meetings were basically management threatening everyone's jobs/ talking about disciplinary actions if sales numbers were not met. Worst. Job. I. Ever. Had.
bad,I enjoy working for Wells Fargo. I needing to find something closer to home and I would like a change of pace. I think there could more challenge for this job for less turn over
bad,The call center in which I worked was a complete JOKE! They pay awful-and expect the WORLD. Not something to make a career out of
bad,People I worked with were o.k . Management was not very professional. Manager would yell at employees every morning meeting for not making enough sales. Would have been a good job if not for that.
bad,Had a great time working there. Management was great and so were the benefits. Worked on loans and enjoyed helping people save money on there mortgages.
bad,Phone bank 2-handled incoming calls from customer regarding their banking need  all about sales not helping the customer
bad,I enjoyed waking up in the morning and going to work.  I felt like I was helping Clients succeed financially. I also loved teaching about the do's and don'ts about spending money.
bad,"Talk about pressure sales to THE MAX! Banking is NOT what it use to be anymore. This institution has become very greedy and SALES driven.  Customer service is NOT their #1 priority either. EVERYDAY you were required to have appointments for new accts. This is the main goal for Wells Fargo. Open as many accts as you can in a day. Your salary and commission was centered around your production. And you better hope your appt. shows up and didn't cancel because if they did, your manager was looking at you as to what your next plan is to meet your daily goal for the day. There was no healthy balance between family life and work life. IF you called out sick, you better make sure your numbers (goals) look good or they will make you feel bad for calling out. Micro managed and ""coached"" ALL THE TIME no matter if you had a good previous week of sales. Definitely a banking industry that convinces you and manipulates you into thinking that every customer you sit with has a financial need in that moment to uncover and a sales product to sell them on, regardless of what you believe is best for the customer financially."
bad,this again is a job for a person who is just getting into the work field. if you do not know anyone who is working there then you are very limited on where you can go or your future in the company
bad,Company merged with Wachovia Bank back in 2002.  I made great friends there.  I think it's downfall was the fact that their service was so horrible.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"The sales structure is horrible. I understand it was a sales job however when people go to a bank they want a couple of things first, security and customer service. But instead we were to sell and sell and sell even if customers did not need a product we were to push it on to them to hit our numbers. If we did not then there would be a meeting and then a write up."
bad,"Stay away, unless you like to be hounded down like a dog by your store manager because you did not make your daily numbers or you did not offer that poor old lady on a fixed social security income a line of credit."
bad,"The company, employee's and managers are some of the best.  Great culture environment.  They give good training and information."
bad,"impossible long days, very hard budget constraints, no support from corporate or the management team, do as I say not as I do attitude"
bad,The problem is its such a big company. The management sucks and you have no balance in work and real life.You come to work open up everything than sit around and hear all the people tell you how horrible your sales or service is. Nothing ever positive. Its a very draining work environment.
bad,"The most stressful company you could work for."
bad,This company is so into sales they forget about the actual part o customer service. They are very picky for sales. If you do not sale they will write you up really quick. If you do not sale they will also try to fire you.
bad,if you want your own business - this is the place - except they only pay your overhead for a short time period. Short terms vs long term gains and relationships
bad,Horrible experience all-around.  Upper Management forced employees to open multiple accounts for clients without disclosing pertinent information
bad,"Awful treatment, I felt like my opinion did not matter and that I was sort of locked in. The income was strong, but I was also a full time student working a shift from 2 to 11 at night"
bad,"All upper management is concerned with is the Borrower and Wells Fargo's bottom line. Wells Fargo wants to be in every household in the nation, that is to have every household's mortgage, checking/savings, charge cards, everything!  What they don't tell their ""clients"" is that they send their financial information overseas to India so they can ""help process loans"" while we are sleeping. This is so concerning to me and I voiced my concerns while I worked there.  What is to keep people ""overseas"" from stealing our identities? We are giving them everything to do so - tax returns with addresses, social security numbers, other documentation with birthdates, etc. Could we really prosecute people in another country if this were to happen?  Management does not care about the employees, does not care if you have a ""life"" or are happy or what you think. HR is in another state and is not supportive.  Beware of this employer!"
bad,I was trying to rate all stars I really enjoyed this jog helping customers with there credit cards. I learned about banking and there products
bad,Sales people were made to push multiple checking accounts and other services clients didn't need and would increase monthly service fees for the bank. Supervisors had favorites and coached and mentored them while others had to opportunity to move up.
bad,This job I worked as a temporary employee and it only lasted for a month then the assignment ended. Working for this company was good I learned a lot from my co-workers.
bad,"Company has recently changed to Direct Insurance.  Company went through a few mergers over the years and a many changes.   I was a victim of downsizing.  ""Last one in, First one out situation"".  Still loved the company.  Not much room for growth."
bad,"I would start my day with answering inbound calls for customers with questions regarding they health savings account, apply payments as requested and check account balances. I learned mostly the difference between IRA's and HSA's. Management monitored how I handled a customer and if anything I said needs to be adjusted. The hardest part of my job was learning the many templates that may needed to be added to the account. The most enjoyable part was the flexibility."
bad,"This company is only good for people that enjoy being dishonest to meet sales goals. Pay is below market. They originally said that employees only had to work one weekend a month, but many ended up working every weekend."
bad,"I worked in the Modification dept, and here our main focus was to help customer with the loan modification, Typical date starts with reviewing a file and do income analysis, with the ratio we run all the tool to see what rate and term would work for the borrower."
bad,The mortgage management team treated everyone like you were on a production line.  They might as well have had a whip in their hands.  The more work you did the more work they gave you.  It increased and increased and increased until you were under so much pressure you could have burst.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Great place to work for, great benefits. great training program, great place for advancement. Management is great. Management opportunities."
bad,"If you want to be treated like a number, with minimal pay and horrible hours, apply here.  The management doesn't care about the employees or the customers.  Everyone either quits or gets fired for petty reasons so they can find new people to take advantage of and pay them less."
bad,"A came to work at Wachovia through there acquisition of World Savings. First Union, the bank that acquired Wachovia, took on the name of Wachovia but not their management- or Worlds. Wachovia did not survive the 2008 recession and was acquired by Wells Fargo."
bad,horrible hours and no job advancement that's why they always hiring. nothing against them and who works there but its just not a stable job
bad,They don't care for employee who else will they care for? Managers care less. They never come to work or leave early and they retaliate if you call on them. They have been given so much power that your future relies on them.
bad,Training DID NOT prepare you at for what happens once you hit the floor - in training we had to complete 35 tutorials - that was a big waste of time - now when you hit the floor you have team leads that at first seemed nice - BUT THEN THEIR TRUE PERSONALITIES CAME OUT!!!!!  You have to have a 45% referrel rate per day - management cares ONLY ABOUT NUMBERS AND STATS!!!!!  You see people if you don't make 45% referrel rates YOUR MANAGERS don't get their bonus.  They push you - they scream at you - they embarrass you every single day - they roll their eyes - they gossip about you - and your lunch gets stolen a lot -  and if this is the environment you want - please be my guest - out of all of the call center I have ever worked at this one was the worst - that is why they are always recruiting for this department - because everyone QUITS!!!!  Don't fall into this trap - because you too will become part of the WALKING DEAD
bad,"Loved the job. Benefits were great, Employees very friendly . Financial management, business operations,  customer service and retention,  promotions are key."
bad,New management was completely incompetent and unprofessional. It became a very stressful work environment to where employees that had been there for years wanted to leave the company.
bad,i highly recommend that no one works for this company. very shady people. all the hard work you do with such no pay. they do not care about the employees. they just want customers to get charged a million fees and have 100 different accounts. horrible management.
bad,You should only work at this company if you have no dignity left in you. your performance is not going to get you any where in the company but who you know and who you.........
bad,This company does not care about it's employees! I worked here for 4 years and the new hires made as much as me! For a big business that gives it's CEO 18-20 million a year I'm sure they can pay their tellers more. For someone who worked here for 4 years and always helped and did more then needed it felt like I was not appericated. The sales goals are very high and unrealistic. This could be a great place but upper management is too worried about sales to care about it's employees! Be prepared to be punished if you don't meet your sales goals!
bad,got called into a temporary managers office because someone said I stank... it was 110 in the summer.... lmao to this temp manager and she was offended that I didn't take her seriously
bad,Management is terrible!  Pretty bad when your management went out with particular tellers in evening to go drinking...bank management also told whole teller line about her s__life and very personal information (how can you respect someone like that). We were required to solicit every customer that came into bank all they want is to sell products.  I would hate to bank somewhere where I'd be nagged everytime I was there to do business.
bad,"Management is a joke, this is the branch managers first job. If you like getting told by a little kid who has no idea what she is doing then its the job for you."
bad,Don't get use to your team. They have a high turn over rate. I am a top performer across the board. It's not supportive here. You take it home with you. They do not support your advancement and learning. Management is kind of ghetto here and most employees. You will be surprised. I ended up being diagnosed with serious health issues even as a top stressing performer. The pay is not worth this. So many more employers will pay you more to do this type of the job. You will only bonus like $40 a month. There are some very weird characters working in these call centers. A lot of unprofessional employees hence the reason for the high turnover rate. Inappropriate language and acts of violence. No extra perks and the coffee is horrible. The only way to get ahead is to work tons of overtime. The opportunity for advancement lacks here. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time.
bad,"- Mind your own business. Remember what you're at work for. Do what you're pay to do, not what the next person do."
bad,I do not know have anything good to say about this company.  This company was so pressured driven that it forgot how to treat their employees.  You felt like the money that came in was more important than your life.  No one should work for a company like this.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,I love the Employee Benefit program. atmosphere was too intense everyone was complaining about management. Unhappy employees who are always seeking a new job instead of being happy where they were.
bad,Morning huddle stage direct sales and more sales the most enjoyable is helping the clients and making them happy. wells Fargo is really aggressive in sales clients and there needs are the priorty
bad,"Very busy branch"
bad,"Dont work here. i worked here at the age of 22 my store manager was the same age. She didnt deal with stress well. When she faced pressure from upper management she would go as far as saying ""I hate being the smartest one in the room  . ."" she would confront you about your stats in front of other coworkers and talk aout us to one another. She set the tone for more disrespect to occur . She thought it was comical when my coworker would ask me "" What ?! You cant  cook fried chicken ? , Hey are you going to Boosie ( rapper ) concert tonight ? Im christian and quiet nothing exudes ghetto but at first site of frustation , if even a look , i was called ghetto ,"
bad,good place not to work. poor leadership. only concerned with numbers.
bad,"You are on your own, as in no support. Supervisor is there to collect reporting and conference calls. Extremely unfortunate."
bad,"Classic example of a toxic work environment.   Poisonous political environment, antiquated technology, a million layers of useless middle management who sole goal is hanging onto their paychecks with disregard for the clients or other associates."
bad,Pay is horrible your stuck at your desk all day no flexibility no stability no career patching its a revolving door people constantly get hired and fired no one likes the environment.
bad,not a place you want to work in Ma. poor training and management that feeds you false promises
bad,"Very Great!! "
bad,"Not a place I would suggest working for, Typical day starts with a meeting about number goals, I learned that banking is sales driven, management is overwhelming, coworkers are fantastice they recruits outgoing people, hardest part about the job is selling products to people that don't need it, Is talking to new people everyday"
bad,"the teller position was to competive"
bad,I really hated it. Always had to push sales to customers that didnt want it. If you were off that day by something small a team lead or supervisor would pull up with you and ask you what you were going to do about it! even if you were doing everything you were supposed to be doing.
bad,You have to arrive for your shift 15 mins early every day to even be one time!  Then if you ask your direct manager a question you get an answer then ask a different manager the same question you get a different answer. You have to deal with customers all day who are not at all appreciative. Most of the time they dont listen to anything you are trying to tell them more the less try to upsell and cross sell something to them to help them out.
bad,"Poor management since 2011 drove Eastern Washington Home Mortgage offices into the ground."
bad,"I was told this was not a sales job when I was hired.  However, it was nothing but sales and almost no customer service.  My supervisor advised me once to send a customer to the branch for assistance because it would take me too long on the phone.  She then told me to sell him something & transfer him to the sales department."
bad,"I really cannot speak for the entire group of employees as Wells Fargo is in 38 states, but in my area, if you know sales, you can work here.  Otherwise, forget it.  Management is consistant cookie cutter robots."
bad,"Racist management, they treat you like trash if you're not brown nosing upper management, they have no respect nor loyalty for long time employees, they promote who they like and not who is qualified, they don't care about their employees health, and they don't care about their employees life/home balance.  They constantly make it known that Wells Fargo should basically be more important than anything else in life."
bad,I would never work here again. Very stressful and sales driven not caring about the customer.
bad,"Hi Employee turnover,  mainly management,  training was horrible for the new systems implemented."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Now know as wells fargo"
bad,"Too much work, not enough money, only care about the number you produce, and management is terrible."
bad,"A typical day as a manager with Wells Fargo is filled with stress.  Companies should focus on helping improve the internal customer experience, instead, Wells Fargo heaps upon managers so many miscellaneous tracking exercises and conference calls that you don't get to really manage the sales process. Rather than coach and show coach to success, senior management in exercise punitive measures on any given day a branch doesn't meet a daily sales goal.  For example, if the branch doesn't trick enough customers into taking unnecessary products and services, bankers must stay to make extra phone calls as punishment.  Managers are held hostage on conference calls late in the evening in order to explain why a particular goal wasn't reached.  On these calls, managers are talked to in a condescending manner on an open conference call."
bad,"The company wanted to get as many loans processed. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, it was a fast pace environment."
bad,"Call center no mater where or what department you were in. it was always about numbers to report to the gvt. "
bad,"call center environment,"
bad,"This is a terrible company to work for, they say they want you to enhance customer relations with Wells Fargo, but what they mean is do everything possible to cost the customer money and if your sales slip even a tiny bit for one hour they bark down your neck as if you're just not trying and try to get you to quit. They constantly tell you that if you are doing above average but not excelling all goals that you could be terminated. Finally their attendance policy is so strict that it doesn't matter if you're throwing up at your desk or getting robbed at gun point, if you are off the phone they threaten you with occurrences and termination. Every time you come in, there is someone there to threaten you with termination. They don't care about employees, they don't care about customers, and they won't care about you. Avoid Wells Fargo like the plague."
bad,bad management under paid high risk to get fired worst envioment to work in honestly
bad,"management sucked , unorganized hated being talked too like you were nothing and the pay sucked. i just hated this job ."
bad,Management not able to lead or delegate to fellow co-workers. Over all horrible environment.
bad,"I notice for the start that team support wasn't part of the job.  Our help resource team made it very difficult to get assistance when needed.  Their job was to assist the reps. with situations beyond our understanding. However, they would make reps feel less of themselves to discourage them from calling the support line."
bad,Contracted employee with no permanent opportunities. They work you to the bone and don't offer benefits or a permanent position even when people rave about your work. They milk the contractors then dump them in the trash.
bad,"Both managers were pregnant and so I was fed to the sharks to figure out how to do their job. I learned I shouldnt have left where I was at the time for this job because I knew when both managers would come back they wouldnt need me. They would tell me this is my teller line, but reality it was her teller line and when I wanted to do something I couldnt."
bad,"Received calls for customer service allowed no time to complete my own work."
bad,I have no complaints working with this company or the people. Everyone was very helpful and if I had any questions there was no problem with answering my questions
bad,this company only takes temps and never hires employees full time.
bad,"Fun loving environment"
bad,This dept treats you like a number and management is awful.  Worked there 14 years and placed in this dept last year....was the most awful and stressful job with no support from management
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Worst company ever. I wouldn't recommend this job for anyone
bad,Wells Fargo does provide a stable income. it is a good company but it doesn't provide flexibility for women with children.
bad,"Maybe it was just the branch itself, however, in the beginning it was a nice, new , exciting enviroment. After settling in, I realized how high turnover the company had . They blatantly told new employees that we had to ""sell"" three products a day to our clients or we would be written up. The threats continued with lists of rules that would get you ""terminated"" with the company. In training they explained that the reason sales were so important was because if a client had only a checking and the company messed up their account, the client could close and walk away and go somewhere else. However, if the client had insurance, checking, savings, credit cards, and etc. it would be harder for them to close their accounts even if we messed up their account. They basically told us that we would mess up, or the company would... then they would threaten termination, termination, termination.  On top of the fact the co-workers were always trying to step on one another for advancement in the company. People who did gain advancement were unqualified or uneducated about that position. All they cared about was money and not the people who had the accounts with them. All about the company but not the employees or the people with accounts."
bad,This was the worst job I have every had the management and staff lie just to keep you trapped there. It was like working for the Devil in the pit of Hades
bad,The sales pressure is unreal!!! You don't matter and your customer doesn't matter! Only sales numbers matter. They don't care about anything you do right. They only care about what you do wrong. It was the WORST company I've ever worked for.
bad,"poor management"
bad,"The corporate culture here was awful and the managers are completely unprofessional.  Would not recommend Wells Fargo, Business Direct to anyone as an employer.  The Operations area is poorly managed & they do not appreciate hard working employees, but rather utilize favoritism and friendship as their gauge for employee performance. Additionally, the training they offer is poorly developed and facilitated."
bad,Do not care about their people. They are totally a numbers company.
bad,I am a teller...I would like to be a banker eventually. I think it's an ok company...there are a lot of changes that have to be made.
bad,"I enjoy the fast paced environment, I like being busy through out my day. The sales pressure is extremely high so if you cant handle stress this is not the job for you. Very difficult to find opportunities for growth."
bad,"Proactively cross-selling products through various sources such as: referrals, offsite, local traffic, and outbound campaigns.  Emphasized on customer relationships so to provide financial counseling, and product services.  Ranging from checking/savings accounts, leading opportunities, and retirement investment.  S.A.F.E mortgage licensing and NMLS compliant."
bad,"I started with this company March 10, 2014.  I was the only external out of 22 associates hired.  From day one I saw behaviors that I thought the banking industry does not allow.  Management is completely horrible.  Training is substandard.  The LAM 4, Loan Administration Manager 4 over FHA is a nut case.  In her words ""She would respect you more if you came in sick then left for the day instead of staying at home watch soaps"".  Completely disrespectful.  The managers will admit that they do not know what the associates do, that was evident with my manager.  The work Directors are also horrible.  Many of these managers are promoted because they are liked but not because they are qualified.  THEY DO NOT HAVE DEGREES THEMSELVES.  They lower the salaries and push for you to get bonuses when in other companies you can get the salary without the bonus.  I resigned in a matter of 2 months."
bad,"Production enviroment "
bad,"I provide pay histories, collection notes, letters and 1098s/1099s to internal employees and to the customers.  Work along side with other external third parties for ordering/requesting prior servicers pay history, collection notes and letters if available.  Learned to work side by side well with others internal/external and get along extremely well with all.  Management is typically ok, except mine likes to ""micro-manage"" which does not include assisting with better managing my capabilities.  Management above her, is outstanding.  The hardest part of my job, is when a team member needs a pay history escalated right now and they know I'll take care of them because that customer is depending on it...but rules and procedures deny me this obligation and I have to tell them that they need to apply to all the above and escalate to management and to the microfiche email box.  The most enjoyable part of my job is all my team members through out the company!  Doesn't matter what state, everyone I work with, be it NC, MN, TX, SC, CA, wherever, they all are super great people to work with!  I love giving people the business. Keeps their minds off the everyday excitement!"
bad,"I enjoyed my time here; however, I will not be working with the company again due to their customer service policies and poor integration across functional units. The hierarchy of the company prevents any advancement. I tried to advance within the company and the recruiters were not open to moving me into a job appropriate for a college graduate; however, once learning of my employment with a successful start up, they were willing to offer me a lucrative package. I decided to say no due to the company's policy of how it treats both customers and employees."
bad,good teaching good hours good people always had chance for and advacement
bad,Not too fond of this company. They don't pay too much. They treat the employees like a number.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Management is only looking out for the firm.  The salary is pretty good compared to the industry but it's a tough environment to succeed
bad,"In office by 7 got ready to tackle my day.  Reviewed the most urgent files for funding purposes that took about 30 min. Started reviewing in order of urgency. By 9 we had some kind of conference call that would last anywhere from a 1/2 hr. to an hour.  After call, we would have an impromptu meeting for another 30 min. Oh and in between all of this we had to review new submission, submit them, make sure our funding's were in order. This could range from 3 to 7 new submissions and maybe 10 or so already in processing and then hopefully another 5 or so to send into funding. Now we are at lunch time, and of course I couldn't take it because I've had most of my morning interrupted with conference calls, meetings and doing some kind of tracking report for upper management. Oh, I forgot to factor in any issues that may arise in funding, processing or submitting a file. I also will stop for any co-worker that is needing my help.  So really out of the 10 to 15 files, I have actually sent maybe 1 to funding submitted maybe 2 if there were no issues and then review 1 issue ridden file that has been in the process for a while and I'm trying to work it any way possible (25 days from start to clear to close, what a crock).  Now it's 4 and I'm supposed to leave (Wells doesn't like to pay overtime, they just like to occupy most of it).  So in essence of all this, my day was cut drastically by management.  I've learned that I truly enjoy working for the borrower in any way possible.  Some of my co-workers are very wonderful.  The hardest part of the job was doing all the meaning less reports"
bad,I enjoyed working with different people with new and bright ideas.
bad,"Smile no matter how your feeling, impress your costumer and use any tactic to sell. Honestly can't even continue writing about this job it's to bothersome and scary. Every day was a challenge due to employee harassment and mangers abuse to prove the sell to all customers obtain their bonus and impress regional directors. Employees live at a high level of fear, panic from regional's and directors. these are beyond non working conditions for any human being. Horrible cause stress, loss of memory, falls, weight gain, bone pain, sleep disorders, food binging, etc."
bad,"I was trained to do the same thing all day, every day and no chance of advancement. I worked there for many years and had no raise in 5 of them. I would apply for jobs and got nothing but rejections, no matter how many times I got awards for my stats. If you are looking for a job to work until you find something better, go to WF. They are just going to look at you as a body to fill a chair anyway."
bad,"-take customer dinner order"
bad,collecting was easy hardest part was dealing with supervisor and manager politics
bad,"I loved OT but hated the idea of them forcing it on us,, you have to work OT and in one department they forced us working 2 days until the system lock at 11:30 pm for a guy that start at 6 am that was tough working almost 18 hours in a day then have to be back at 6 am the next day."
bad,sales demands that do not look out for the best interest of the customer.
bad,"A place that teaches you values. You learn a lot on account, goals of selling products."
bad,All they do is therein you about sale and if you don't make sales you lose your job they do not care about you pay sucks to
bad,"Management needs to inprove  "
bad,"High turnover of loan officers (HMCs) due to unrealistic expectations. Their goal is to originate perfect loans while making the customers happy.  Yet, customers are unhappy when their applications are rejected. "
bad,"9:00. Am on Monday, sales meeting. Sales mgr advises you that you are not meeting minimum expectations.  The mtg originator ask! uh? Sales mgr cannot show any numbers, because they are always unprepared.  Mgr. asks what are doing to get outside sales numbers, the HMC responds, and as always, the mgr give no good ideas or help, just note writing.  Poor Sales Managers : is why mortgage business at WFHM has need declining the past 12 months, and they continue to layoff employees!"
bad,"Bank Teller, providing financial needs to customers in a fast paced environment"
bad,Where to start? The most unprofessional work experience! I felt that I was back in high school! I am not trying to be sexist but if you are a female and well endowed then expect excellent treatment. Sales goals are absolutely insane to the point that I was lying to customers and clients. I was guaranteed advancement in the company within two months of date of hire because of my previous work experience. Nine months have passed by and still no promotion? I worked my tail off to the point where I was becoming unhealthy and feeling that whatever I did wasn't good enough! Absolutely no recognition whatsoever! Only apply if you are in dire need of a job!
bad,"HARD "
bad,"The teller training is good, management accuse you when mony missing from other teller instead of investigating, they racist towards minority, management is never honest, they paint a perfect picture to work there when its horrible. The customers especially the old ones most of the time is nasty and mean,. Supervisors look out for themselves, they believe that the bank comes before your family, and never trust management they just tells lies along with passing blame for their faulty system and lack of operation loss and security for the employees"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,I have worked with this company for 1 1/2 yrs. as a contractor and saw a lot of injustice when it came to hiring and promotions. The department I worked in was mortgage and I can't understand how a perm employee didn't know what a deed of trust was. I have been on several interviews no job offer. My contract expired and I'm unemployed. Funny thing is I have a real estate background.
bad,This is a employer of last choice in all categories. It is an awful place to work. You will feel like just a number.
bad,"I was brought on to build a natural gas derivatives trading desk at Wachovia Bank, NA. After the merger with Wells Fargo I took over Base/Precious Metals and Agriculture Derivatives Trading. I then took back Head of Natural Gas Derivatives Trading before taking over the Head of Crude Derivatives Trading."
bad,the worst place I have ever worked. if you love to be lied to all day and have no follow up done on your request then this company is for you. if you love hearing customer cry bc someone lied to them or opened an account up for them with out them knowing then this company is for you.
bad,"This company was the worse job I ever had. All they wanted us to do is sell products to customers. We were in a low income area, to which no one was approved, so sales were bad. This company does not care about the customer, only all the bad products they push on people. Run far away from this company!!"
bad,unorganized management and company do not work at this location.
bad,You feel bad that you are working for such company every day and salary sucks
bad,Everyone is out for themselves there. They don't care about tellers or bankers.
bad,"employees opinion doesn't matter, felt like a slave at this financial institution, forced to push customer to products they don't want or need."
bad,"*usually good- management was never around or available but if you had to miss a day or came in a little late and made up the time, you were talked to and warned."
bad,No job security when your sick.  Management had their picks. The company is unfair to certain employees.
bad,"company is focused on what you can do for them, but when you need them, they are not there."
bad,WE were monitored daily on our personal times and ACW. They treated us more like children than adults. Would give you multiple positions and new duties however wouldn't pay you for it.
bad,lots of promises and they never came thru.  No sales department and are not family friendly.  Its a lower version of West.
bad,A typical work day would be very Negative. As with most environments that are negative it spreads around horribly through here. There is really nothing positive to say about Wells Fargo or at least the department I worked in.
bad,Loved working downtown and the option to work from home too!
bad,"I do not have very much to say about working for this company. Based on past experiences, I would not consider working for this employer again."
bad,I have very little respect on the way Wells Fargo and other Bog Banks treat fellow emplyees. THey secretly laid everyone off a week before christmas after looking at us all in the eye telling us us it wasn;t going to happen.
bad,"Management is more interested in being your friend then your boss. Promotions are given to people the District Managers like, not who is qualified. You're daily life consists of doing your own job, and cleaning up after everyone else."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Internal Customers call for technical support."
bad,"Taking calls all day and forced sell, sell, sell, the people are nice and some management really do a good job, but I would not recommend this company if you are looking to advance or make a career of it."
bad,"Worst company i have worked for my life and i am ex military.  Rude abrassive and total non professional of"
bad,"I worked for this company for five years and it was the most unorganized, deceptive, demeaning and unprofessional job I've ever had. The management was horrible and looks were the only thing that got people anywhere. I would not recommend Wells Fargo to anyone, especially since they lay off people it seems like every hour."
bad,Wells fargo is the worse company that has been established to serve us. They do not honor their core values for the employees or their customers... My advice is to leave!!!!
bad,"Typical day at work varies. Co-workers are team players."
bad,"Out of all the big banks i have enjoyed working for wells fargo the most. in fact, its not even close. My management is very hands off but is excellent on being there when needed. A typical day is calling on leads and creating my own marketing to generate loan applications for new home purchase or current loan refinances. The hardest part is getting the new business. everything else i really enjoy"
bad,"Goals are very high- every PB2 in the district has the same goals regardless of how busy your branch is or how many other bankers work at your location."
bad,I suggest you only take a job with this company if you have a strong sales background and live in a BIG area. I am from a small town of 1500 people and they expected our branch to have goals like a town of 3500 people. It was absolutely ridiculous! 
bad,"Big time micro management, sales target reviews weekly, lazy top management, top down communication only. Worst place I ever worked. It was quite disappointing for a nationwide company.AVOID!!! Look elsewhere. "
bad,used a computer to put in accounts and amounts of the items I did about 2600 an hour with amounts and 850 with account numbers and tran code numbers and so on. The management was nice and you learn to get deadlines done. All my co workers were nice and even help as references. I loved the hours the most. 7 to maybe 1pm some nights and even weekends if they needed me.
bad,"A typical day at work was listening to the co-workers gossip about each other in between customers. I worked with a younger group of individuals. This was the hardest part, along with trying to sell the banks products to the same weekly customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was engaging with the customers and talking them into seeing a banker to get a sale. Poor management, which allowed the unprofessionally to continue. I wasnt able to focus due to the negativity going on in the workplace."
bad,"Every day is some kind of stress for no reason. Mgr want to have you meet this sells goal with not enough tolls to do so, So you have to do what you have to do for loans and accounts and most of the time they kno and tell you to do these things until something goes wrong then they act like they didnt kno. Banking should be about helping the customers Wells Fargo is about helping it self. Hate it!!"
bad,"Work conditions, pay and opportunity of advancement all poor at the head office location. Wells Fargo has since begun to pull out of the Canadian market."
bad,"big firm, not a great culture.  Not a great work/life balance"
bad,Managers knew less than employees.  My manager was very sarcastic.  The married men in the department were very inappropriate with their comments and gestures.  
bad,"I had to keep selling customers products such as credit cards and savings accounts, and when I did make meet my goal I would never get my bonuses it was always an excuse."
bad,balance the  bank accounts; accounting; book keeping; customer service rep of Credit cards approval department; numerical entry by touch.
bad,They say they will support you but dont have monthly meetings to see how you are doing and little or no support unless you are doing great without their help.  No recognition either.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad, 
bad,I've worked for many banks in my career and none has been as bad as this one.  All they care about is selling selling selling.  Theyre practices border on unethical.. My manager would force me to open accounts for people who werent even present in the bank.. No one seemed to care about the customer just the bottom line.  
bad,no morals no values collect the money at any cost. constantly kept in fear of what would happen if we didn't meet our goals.
bad,"Co-workers not embracing change."
bad,"If you are starting off in Mortgage as entry level with Wells Fargo, DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY, I repeat DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY.  I was overworked almost every single day. Some of your co-workers will not know all the steps in detail so then your work directors will just push all of that work onto you.  Also, be advised that work directors and upper management do not do anything but pawn all of their difficult work off to other employees. They do not listen to their employees or consider any of their needs.  I voiced out my concerns to my work director numerous times and he stated he would take care of it.  But nonetheless, he flat out did nothing about it.  I ended up leaving.  I was still in contact with a good friend of mine that worked under the same team and SURE ENOUGH, they were struggling without me."
bad,"Was responsible for reviewing loans that were either in foreclosure or foreclosed on between specific dates to determine if proper federal and state procedures had been followed"
bad,everyone was always in someone esles space and  bussine......................
bad,"Wells Fargo is the 4th company I have worked for and by far the most disloyal, unappreciated company I've ran into. These people will not think twice about screwing a customer out of their loan to make their numbers look better. You have to learn how to brown-nose to be able to move up within this company, no matter how great you are at producing. If you know someone or know how to brown-nose you might find a better position making $16/hr. Yes, $16/hour for acting fake and having dreams to be the next top gun. Once you get use to the program, you will start realizing people are successful by lying and cheating to make their numbers look better. It's so unethical that they stream these customers along and keep asking for more and more documentation all while making customers continue to make higher payments that they cannot afford. The management there is an absolute joke. About 10 % of the managers are actually qualified. Yes, this is including Senior Managers too. Once you get in this place you will find out EXACTLY what I am talking about when you get presented your Senior Managers and listen to them talk and how they represent themselves. This was probably the most brutal thing in knowing you are under someone who would be laughed at by any company. One other thing about this process is not one Manager, Mortgage Consultant, Underwriter, or Closer are on the same page. SO much mass confusion and disorganization. Also, for the interview don't even sweat trying to look business professional because you will work with people straight off the street."
bad,Good working Environment and great location
bad,they are notorious for hiring a ton of new people and laying them off when they are through with them. I have a friend who was hired and fired from them 3 times already and they still call to re-hire him.
bad,"Wells Fargo doesn't care about employees and not even customers. Managers treat to like you are nothing. Just keep watching the news and you will see...what goes around, comes around. WF just worry about ways to makes sales and open customers accounts. Stay away, think before you take a job with them and get humiliated ... managers that don't have A CLUE! !..WF will get their pay back for what they are doing with employees."
bad,"This company is, by far, one of the worst imaginable places to work at. The pressure to sell is so intense, that cheating and gaming are rampant. Management knows and turns a blind eye. HR knows and covers for Management. It's bad. Really bad. They actually pressure you to do things that everyone knows is not only unprofessional and immoral, but flat ILLEGAL. NOT WORTH IT. Trust me! I was there for 14 years!!!!!"
bad,"I was ready to walk out of this job after only 2 weeks of observing before even staring my training. Branch Manager and District Manager have absolutely no concept of Leadership Skills. They treat their employees with no dignity or respect. Maybe it was just the Branch/District/Region I worked in but hearing from other members of the same training class I attended it is across the board. Along with that having worked for a few banks before, the selling practices at Wells Fargo is in a class of their own with their unethical sales practices. I should have known this was an issue when they require you to take a Sales Ethical Training Class which I have never had to do for any other bank in my 17 years in banking. It’s no wonder this bank has a high turnover rate. And no I was not terminated, I resigned with two weeks’ notice."
bad,"worked there for 9 months it was the worst job I ever had. Knew what we were doing was wrong. After I left they eventually, being part of the problem in the subprime mortgage lending industry, closed this branch of Fargo down."
bad,Pick up and deliver valuables. Serviced and fixed Atm machines. Lots of driving.
bad,"Horrible Employer, never work there. Not worth your time to work there. Very High turnover."
bad,Training is a rush job; Management could care less about your life.;
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"This company is all about sales and creating sales, management is constantly over-shadowing, HR was horrible during orientation, and second guessing on all my credentials, work culture was poor and lacked real personability, and capacity. Overall this company from day one contantly was about meeting sales quotas, making sales thru competing with co workers, creating conflicts between associates, fighting over sales (cross sales etc.) incentives, I dont think of ever working here again and i would never recommend working for them for so much less."
bad,"I worked there since it was First Union.(15 years) Ever since Wells took over it has been terrible..Not only do the majority of all employees hate it but also the customers. They don't care about customers at all!! They tell you to sell to every customer without regards to whether they want it or not. Drive thru you tell them they are getting this or that and then turn off the mic. They sell credit cards without telling them they are credit cards & never give them the required (by law) paperwork. There insurance is a total joke. Where I worked ( in florida) you had to sleep with the management to get promoted. Ever since I left four months ago I have felt like I escaped from a cult..Oh, also don't expect to get any raises if you work there."
bad,Wells Fargo is only concerned with their profit margin. They have no regard for their employees and assign goals that are unrealistic to achieve. Their pay scale does not provide for a decent wage. Most employees that have a family must work two jobs in order to provide for their family.
bad,"no review taken its a temporary job for a month only, we are 12 employees on training not even one was continued on training very bad company to work."
bad,The worst job I have ever had this company is horrible do not care about employees nor customers only want solutions solutions solutions thats the only thing they care about solutions= always selling products customers do not need.
bad,I've been in banking my whole career and this was by far the worst place to work. They don't about their customers or their employees.
bad,"Just all around bad place to work. The pay is terrible, advancement dose not happen forever. Which is ridiculous for someone that has a degree. The job is stressful and management is always changing what they expect out of you."
bad,"I consider myself pretty easy to work with, but not there. There was a change when Wells Fargo took over Wachovia Bank. A culture change. There where incentives to sell more products to customers, but there where cocnditions to this that NO One could ever achive. If you messed up and told management you where written up for the smallest thing. Please don't work here, it is a revolving door."
bad,Well Fargo does not value its employees. I enjoy the work but the company makes it hard to do your job.
bad,The most agressive management team. Out Manager left who was the only person who tried to protect us but I guess she had enough of the abuse. We watched her passionately try to get us extra help and even she had noone to help her but she worried for us and got shot down. Its never enough. NOW WE ARE ALONE
bad,Lousy pay and benefits
bad,"The typical day of work consists of a morning huddle with all staff, most of the time it's with the Personal Bankers, Small Business Banker, Mortgage Consultant Banker, and Financial Advisor. The corporation has different sales vision varying based on corporate objectives, (i.e. Sell Home ELOCS) on a daily basis. It's the Personal Bankers responsibility to bring in new business (i.e. Checking, Savings, Debit Card, Credit Card, Mortgage Referral, and Financial Advisor Referrals) and meet those sales objectives, while giving ""exceptional"" customer service. The company has a ""Daily Activity Planner"" sheet that every employee is required to fill out in the morning before the store opens. The ""DAP"" is used as a ""tool"" for the bank to measure what different activities you have planned throughout the day. Typically depending on the store location and the foot traffic coming into the store, keeping occupied can be your advantage or disadvantage. If it's to your disadvantage the company has different databases which help you ""scrub"" (""Scrub: Finding other means to create relationship banking. I.e. Cross-selling other bank affiliated or partner products). For the most part scrubbing will help you find leads; those leads which will help you identify the clients and their needs. From that point on the Personal Banker will attempt to contact the client to have them get a ""Financial Check-Up"" or call to find out more information from the client. The goal is to get the client sitting in the Personal Bankers chair to go over their financial information; daily money management (checking), planning"
bad,Reviewing fraudulent activity on customers' checking accounts. I learned that a lot of customers are very dishonest. Management did not support employees at all. Most tumultous part of the job: going to work.
bad,The hardest part of the day is every hour check in calls with managers
bad,Just depended on the management. My experience with the management when tricked by a customer was terrible. Nobody had my back or even tried to assist me with getting the person charged with falsifying a check. I had to take the hit. Second this mistake cost me my job but the crazy part was that they expected me to spend five more days coming to the bank to sit around and not be able to conduct transactions instead of going to look for another job. Not a great experience at all.
bad,This was one of the worst places I have ever worked. Management works you sometimes 10 hours with out a break to eat or use the restroom. The would get mad at you for things beyond your control and never try to help you preform better when you did mess up.
bad,"N/A Have nothing to report Manages the teller services function to ensure prompt and efficient transaction processing and the generation of sales through quality referrals.

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Call all day, useless reports every 2 hrs and compensation is just disgusting, to anybody thinking about it, just go to Chase or any other bank."
bad,"Company is unfair, inconsistant, over bearing, uncooperative, and down right dirty. They expect morals and ethics but have none themselves."
bad,"I would not recommend this job. Long hours, one break for lunch, sales calls, and no job security."
bad,They require you work at least 50 hours a week (mandatory) and management is horrible! Just look at how often they are hiring people. The turnover is off the charts!
bad,"It is banker mentality trying to run a brokerage. Policies aren’t in line with the best interest of the client rather, office profitability is the mandate."
bad,dont enjoy it no family work balance
bad,"A disgusting political cesspool. Competence, integrity, and hard work are not rewarded.. People are treated as objects (Biological Resource Units). They don't understand the concept of keeping their word."
bad,"Wells Fargo does not care about their employees. As an employee of Wells Fargo, you have absolutely no human value at all. If you are not above exceeding in your sales goals you are treated like you didn't even exsist, only long enough for constant write ups and threats in order to raise your productivity. I did not receive my breaks at all during my time with Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo is an AWFUL AWFUL place to work. Be warned. You will have a nervous breakdown."
bad,Every negative review on the world wide web is true...
bad,The wrong people are in management. They can care absolutely less about their workers.
bad,"I want to begin this by saying that I resigned from this horrid place because I found a better job, I was not fired or asked to resign. So, my opinion is solely based on my experience there, not any retaliation. With that being said, I worked in the Collections Dept in Jacksonville, FL for 3 years. When I initially arrived we were still pretty much governed by Wachovia even though WF had already begun the merger and it was great. Unfortnatelly, about midway through my employment there, WF started to rear their ugly head. They do not care about their employees and will defintely let you know it. Nothing that you do is ever good enough, policies change daily and you are punished if you do not conform right away to whatever ignorant idea they come up with next, the supervisors are mean and nasty, especially the one that i had to deal with. The management and supervisors there will try to take every once of self dignity away from you and they do it with a smite. During a floor meeting, someone from upper management implied that there would not be so many collectors remaining there within the next year. And to be honest, the way that they are firing prople left and right, I would say that either he is a prophet or they had all of this planned out for a while now. If you are still there, I say RUN!!!!!!! There is definitely better out there, I can testify to that. I would NEVER tell anyone to work there unless they absolutely had to, and even then, I would suggest that you continue looking elsewhere. WELLS FARGO IS A HORRIBLE PLACE TO WORK AND I WOULD NOT WISH THE JACKSONVILLE COLLECTIONS"
bad,"Very stressful to work for Wells Fargo, poor management,"
bad,"No comment, i dislike working for the company and it made me want to leave banking in general"
bad,the work is hard and little paid. Certains managers have their favorite employees
bad,"Unfulfilled. Even though they said no sales, you had to sale every call and in this economy, it is hard to make people say yes to even a savings acct. Your performance was based on the sales end of the call. Bad place to pin a career on"
bad,Travel for home preservation is great. Coporate call center environment.
bad,This job requires you to sale accounts to customers that do not have enough money to open them. If you don't sale then your fired. Not worth it at all.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Disaster. Micro-management ran the office into the ground. Relationship managers with great technical ability but with little ability leading people were placed into management roles.
bad,"The management of this company is at best HORRIBLE self centered morons. They do not do what they say and are only there for their own careers and will ruin anyone that gets in their way. Job security is NOT what this company stands for. Also, they make you work thru your breaks and lunch due to understaffing and then tell you that overtime is not allowed."
bad,My co-workers were great. The hardest part of my job was listening to the newborn in the backround and me having to tell the family Wells was taking their home.
bad,"i used to love my job when was wachovia, but unfortunatelly everything star changing when they merge with wellsfargo, benefits dropped, customer service, everything with the employees, so thats why im trying to look forward for something better because i deserve it."
bad,"I worked part time, I learned how to overcome sales objectives."
bad,"When I started with Wachovia everything was great, but ever since Wells Fargo took over there is a lot of changes for the worst. Manager from the West Coast that move on the East coast are firing all the employees that started with Wachovia to replace them with new employees and paid them less. I would not recommend this company to anyone unless you are desperate for a job."
bad,"No one was selfish to help you, if you need assistance. Everybody treated one another with respect. We all treated one another like family."
bad,save your time & your sanity. the management is terrible. the people are awful. and they set unrealistic goals which are certain to drive you mad.
bad,"For a company to have such a vast portfolio of programs to assist the client, the employee gets penalized for going above and beyond to assist the client base."
bad,"Wells Fargo DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR TELLERS, we are treated like nothing. They only has too much promises when you are hired. The regional manager says what people wants to hear . THey only care that we make our sales goals , that's it. THey do not care about anything else. SALES SALES SALES ....And they do not look of a mess they have @ the branch. People waiting on line cus we need to call for the CSM for everything , and so many other issues!!!!!!!!!! RUN AS FAST AS U CAN!!!!!!!!"
bad,"the teller position pays next to nothing, fast food chains in my area consistently pay more. i was hired part-time with part-time benefits but expected to work over 40hrs, stay late, take shortened or no luch break( and forget about any other break) this place was a nightmare. no one lasts long and everyone is miserable. they tell you that its a sales based job but what they dont tell you is that you are completely dependent on bankers for your sales, so if you arent one of the bankers favorites they wont help your people and you get no sales. i can not stress enough what a terrible job this is."
bad,"I worked at WF for 4 years. Each year was worse than the next. Sales pressure is intense on a daily basis. The goals are unrealistic. Senior management is incompetent, unprofessional and micro-managers. The culture is unnecessarily competitive and abusive. Compensation is a joke and it's virtually impossible to meet requirements for annual increases. Forget about scheduling a vacation. Management won't allow more than a week off at a time, no vacations allowed in January and February and only so many bankers can vacation at one time. Turnover is extremely high for Teller and Banker positions."
bad,"You are pushed for sales, no customer service left in the banking industry.,"
bad,This company has no sense of its employees. They don’t care about personal time or family life. You try to tell them how to make it better they don't listen always say it will get better
bad,Got fired for stealing money with no proof no camera and the sad part the co workers i had who went to vouch were never ask anything it was based of being the only black lead teller in the area no proof or anything
bad,I had that worst manager in my career. From what it sounds like all the managers are babysitters watching linked to make sure you're at your desk or logged in. bathroom breaks...
bad,i wouldn’t work for Wells Fargo again they treats employees disrespectfully and don’t care all they do is favor representatives that brown nose they are inappropriate and managers talk negatively to you in front of other employees in meetings degrading!!
bad,This was before the allegations came out about Wells Fargo. They always pressured us to get the sales. It was not a good work environment. All they cared about was selling to customers. They did NOT care about the needs of the client.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"I worked there when they put so much pressure on employees in order to meet goals, that fictitious accounts were opened. When I contacted the Ethics hotline, I was basically forced out of my job by management."
bad,Wells is very micromanaging. Giving feeling of being treated like children. They expect us to take each customer through a roadmap  to uncover needs that will deepen there relationship w Wells. A lot like sales road map before but this time the team not given bonus for there work. Claim no sales but really sales
bad,"Used to be great till new management took over and they sold the department!  Since then everyone is leaving, therefore, you're overworked and certainly underpaid!  Location is terrible, you literally have to fight for a parking spot.  They care more about meeting their numbers than they do the participant's experience and certainly their employees.  Run, not worth it!"
bad,They under pay and overwork you. The turn over is unbelievable. The procedures change weekly it seems which is a high risk to the bank. Everyone is miserable working there.
bad,"As much as I love many of my foreign coworkers; they have formed their own sub-culture, caste system, and under handed politics influencing the work environment landscape in USA in general. I know in many 3rd world countries, people, especially managers, think you have to stand over the worker bees and whip them into submission and they bring that 3rd world mentality over here and think that's how it works here too. No person from such countries should ever be in management position unless they take a lot of HR and management courses; they don't know how to handle it and be nice to their subordinates. A lot of weirdos that no other company would hire, are in charge @WF! And as far as the so-called coworkers, they're very exclusive and NOT inclusive; they congregate during lunch time so they can comfortably speak in their own tongue, clueless that they have now formed a clique excluding others! "
bad,My managment was never there for me. They don't care about much except if your hitting your stats at the call center. It pays ok but its a miserable job.
bad,"No help from management and they don't do what they say they will."
bad,"Horrible company to work for, they try to keep you down. Don't promote nor help move up within the company. The management is horrible, and the company is shady and do not pay correctly."
bad,"If you choose to accept a position with Wells Fargo I admonished you to document EVERYTHING. If ever given the platform and opportunity to return to their old ways, they would do so in a min. and they will, just give them time. "
bad,"Wells has a very ugly company culture. Managers are dishonest and promote others around them who are sycophants but not competent. Layoffs were frequent. Overtime was mandatory over a long period of time due to poor staffing decisions and low retention, and pay was below what it should have been. Really not a company where employees are treated well. I would never work at Wells again."
bad,"Do not work for this company, no work life balance, people call in all the time and the company allows it, poor pay and benefits for what you ahve to put up with, no job security with all of there lawsuits and them closing branches and allowing thier pets to abuse other employees, the mangement bullied for goals and they said goals are gone that is so wrong you are still having to amke goals if not your fired.  Job culture is back stabbing and unfair and unethical and in my opinion illegal and they should be shut down they are a  disgrace place of employment and cusomters need to watch their accounts.  This is my opinion of my 5 years there"
bad,High pressure sales designed to sell products that make people pay fees. There is nothing redeeming about this company. The whole institution is exactly what you would NOT want your bank to be. This organization is terrible.
bad,"Non professional company management is disorganized, unprofessional. No training or explanation on how to perform duties promised 30 hours plus a week and only averaged 9 hours a week."
bad,"Working at Wells Fargo was a very stressful situation for me . They ask you to consult a Virtual library that almost everybody knows that doesn't work properly, have to have good customer service in under 2 minutes phone calls so you have to rush your customer and try to cut the conversation and the scale for bonus is almost impossible to achieve because they check 6 calls every month and you average must be 94% or higher for 3 months in a row plus your handling time during those 3 month must be on average 2 minutes and also your attendance got be almost perfect. For every time you miss a whole day is 1 point for half a day is a half point so if you have 5 points in a 6 months period you get fired. The process to present proof that you were sick is so long an complicated that most of the time people do nothing and get the points."
bad,Managers favor people they know and relates to people in their faces daily. Managers do not care about my input. After I mentioned my abilities and desire to work hard. Been involved in asking critical questions and I was dismissed based on assumptions
bad,Hours were great except for the cold calling after hours. We were forced by management to stay past 7 making calls for sales. The amount of pressure for unrealistic numbers and the culture that was building based on fake sales. I didn’t want to be part of such thing. Values and ethics and priceless. And doing the right thing as well.
bad,"Lots of sales pressure without sales rewards."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"One of the worst organizations I have ever  experienced working. Culture is backstabbing undermining and disloyal."
bad,The Risk & Compliance department is an unhealthy environment at this time.  It was a great place to work 2 years ago but so many organizational changes due to the consent order and negative media has brought in some team members who are not focused on the risk but rather loyalty among former team members.
bad,"The company does not care about the hardest & most stressful employees - the Tellers & Head Tellers."
bad,"This company had a horrific culture. After a crash course  6 week training program, management sends you to the wolves with little or no shadowing or on site training.  "
bad,"Everyone has replaceable noone is thought of as a ""valued"" employee. Very stressful, fast paced and thrown to the wolves once you are put on the floor."
bad,"Gossip, racist management, heartless management, make up rules as they go, bend policy when it benefits them or a favorable employee. Micromanage, 30 min break only and scheduled 830-630."
bad,"I worked as an MLO in the home mortgage dept. You must meet your mortgage closing targets within a few mos. or you're canned."
bad,If you want to work in an environment where you are back stabbed and your managers are unprofessional and discriminate against those they personally don't like then this is the perfect place for you! A typical work day at this location was easy and fast paced it was the leadership or lack of it that is discouraging
bad,I really would not refer anyone to work for Wells Fargo Auto. They don't treat emplyees fairly. Its no room for growth with the company. As of now they currently took bonus structures away.
bad,"Horrible conditions and poor training practices. Turnover is constant as well as hiring. Company's priority is profit, not employees or customers. I would not advise anyone to work here."
bad,"they are taking to long to process applications from start to finish. in order for me to get paid, I need to close loans in order to provide for my family on commission base only."
bad,"Upper Management are puppets with no banking knowledge or experience"
bad,"This company does not like to advance from within.  They do not help or work well with working parents.  You have no paid family time off if your child gets sick, and little to no understanding from management.  Management gets rid of employees due to cost of having you employed there, and then tries to hire you back and lower pay."
bad,"Wells Fargo had the right mind set when they wanted to reset their intentions and start from scratch.  Unfortunately that doesn't mean the same for its employees.  Those who had a 'numbers' mentality seemed to have a clutch on how operations would go. By the end of the day, greed and corruption was the fundamental factor that influenced management decisions."
bad,"Very stressful work place. Management only care about themselves all they want you to do is sale, sale, sale. Its also possible that you can be terminated for bad CEM scores which are surveys given to customers and if they are not approved for a product they will give you a bad score and you will pay for it by management."
bad,"They will tell you about a workplace culture that looks for critical thinkers or how they will help you along a career path. However, all of these are lies, you are a thing an organic robot to make calls and think of nothing else. Any questioning isn't accepted. Any carer goals other than making phone calls for the rest of your life is not welcome."
bad,"Everything reported about the poor and unethical sales behaviors are not only true but were actively taught and managed from the upper levels of Management. Opening accounts without consent, calling family and friends to open additional accounts to hit ""widget targets"" and not securing Clients financial and personal information were common practices"
bad,"Wells Fargo sucks. Apply somewhere else, don't waste your time, or you'll just end up crying in your car. The sales goals are ridiculous and they'll force you to open accounts that customers don't need just to meet the sale quota."
bad,More like a telemarketing job. 30 calls per day. 6 mandatory appointments. Company just care about numbers and sales. System screen clients for offers and employees need to call clients constantly to try to sell offers.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Um. You don’t want to be here right now. This company is almost as bad as IBM. Nepotism, greed, arrogance, are the only way to describe senior management. Run far away from here."
bad,It was a toxic environment with toxic management. You were discouraged from asking question all while handling millions of dollars for large companies. It was also very sexist.
bad,"Work at this branch was my worst experience, the gossipy it horribly, and the managers are the worst; having a group for parties and stuff and if you’re not part of the drinks you’re going to have the worst schedule you can’t imagine; if wasn’t for that will be a great place to work and grow"
bad,"As their culture goes on Wells Fargo has no backing for the employees or new managers,  some managers had never cared for the branch and the area that it is located and hard work was never appreciated."
bad,There is alot to be said about Wells Fargo Document Management. First and foremost talk about manager disconnect. And by that i mean they have absolutely no idea what is happening on the actual floor nor do they care to learn. The benefits are not good considering they are a huge company with massive profits. Compensation is lacking as well. Going from a 9% raise to a .9% raise is despicable.
bad,"Ever changing policies after each scandal. Management not transparent."
bad,Save your time and career. Unreal sales pressure that is unattainable unless you want a law suite (hence their lawsuits). Don't work there. Managers are confused. FA's are confused. DM's are confused.
bad,"Constantly being preached to about ethics and doing the right thing yet my manager lied on my performance review this year, causing me an unfounded status of not even ""met expectations"" which resulted in losing over half of my bonus (over 30k) and no salary increase this year and can't apply for a role on another team."
bad,"Wells Fargo has regular layoffs that are touted as ""redeployments"" or some such other cheery word, but the cold hard fact is that there are regular layoffs."
bad,Terrible management not nice people to work for they use and abuse you give inconsistent schedule as well as just want people to bring their money over with little to no benefits
bad,"You do not ever get to advance. Management is poor, no motivation at all. Very stressful, and very condescending work environment. Very unethical with customers money."
bad,"The unfortunate fact is the WF in it's current environment leaves current ""team members"" with a constant level of anxiety. No one knows if they will have a job the next morning they come into the office. WF is noted for may decades and now, more recently for firing team members in what appears to be an effort to eliminate the senior level and reducing costs by keeping less experienced. Senior level know what is acceptable by the federal investors yet in order to ""generate"" business and make their profit, decisions made by more experienced are over ridden and or pressured to make changes in order to make the transaction. This attitude is what lead the industry to collapse the economy in 2008. My simple advise is to run, don't walk away from WF as a possible employer. No stability, No Team, you are on your own, Don't speak up or you will get fired. Find a different bank to work at is banking is what you want. There are plenty of GOOD honest banks and credit unions out there. WF is not one of them. Run!!!!  If you have not had this experience or know someone else who has had this experience, consider yourself fortunate. Odds are that you will and very soon."
bad,"A company in disarray.  Weekly announcements of new infractions/fines/settlements."
bad,"Wells Fargo presents itself to employees and society as being ALL about the customer. This is certainly not true, as it is not reflected in the allotted call time a phone banker must not last over 280 seconds, on average. This is simply not enough time to truly deliver the wowing experience Wells Fargo claims to provide. They instruct you to cut people off, and do any thing possible to lower that average call time. "
bad,"What seemed to be an exciting opportunity quickly dissipated once training was complete with poor management, constant turnover which lead to mandatory overtime. Overtime would lead to a comfortable hours and pay only to be greatly reduced when fully staffed. Hours were too inconsistent to allow for a constant pay rate. When the opportunity to return to school came I took it."
bad,"A typical work day was very stressful"
bad,"Horible place to work. Employees are being harassed with policy decissions that make no sense. Sales calls are being listened to by 3-4 different departments that look for ""policy violations"" which might be honest mistakes due to amount of info needed to perform your job."
bad,Poor Management and Ethics are an issue. My first day of work I was told to not bring that Bank of America stuff over to Wells Fargo.  Noone even knew a thing about me and to have that as my first impression of Wells Fargo was very disappointing.  Was not valued and was a toxic unethical environment.
bad,"Wells Fargo has become too big to serve its Mortgage Customers fairly or legally as it would appear. I was impressed upon hire, but quickly learned that the underbelly would expose more than I think I wanted to know about the company. I will say that in my year there I learned that I would be better suited elsewhere in a company that I have more faith in."
bad,"Need to help with career advancements and opportunity for growth within the company. More Internship programs needed within the company. Also, management should be developing employees for career advancement for employees to stay with the company."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,nothing good to say about any management. Work environment was very impersonal and factory like. The cons out weigh any pros that I had during my 17yrs working there
bad,"I initially enjoyed my time with Wells Fargo, but upon relocating from North Carolina to Florida, I was disturbed by the management staff in this area. Their lack of professionalism and knowledge impeded my ability to be efficient in my role as a Processor. I left of my own accord to find a position with a better work and life balance."
bad,"When I started working for the company WF prided itself on not having employees but instead having thousands of Team members. Shortly after the merger with Wachovia those team members turned into resources with no value to the company beyond the work produced. Wells Fargo used to try to do the right thing for the sake of doing the right thing, Now the only focus is on reducing operational costs and avoiding negative media attention"
bad,"I was recruited to go to wells fargo and was told a lot of things that made it attractive to come over.  However,  once I came over I never saw one thing that Management promised.  The culture was horrible and no support at all. I eventually had to leave to go to another firm in order to make a living to support my family.  Since I have left,  there's been at least a dozen other Advisors that left that I know and are seeking council."
bad,Wasted over a decade of my professional life with this terrible company.  There is no leadership or vision and turnover is rampant.  Morale has never been lower.
bad,"They provide lots of training at the beginning to get you started. Thereafter, you are chained to your computer and telephone headset. Every minute of your time at the computer is recorded and calculated. Spending any time away from your desk outside your assigned lunch and breaks is forbidden. Consequently, there is no community or collaborative interaction. Your ""stats"" are the measure of your worth, and the unknown middle manager you never see can let you go when your stats are a little off. Getting time off is nearly impossible. If you want to know what wage slavery looks like, this place is for you!"
bad,"Managers (from branch manager to district manager to affluent segment leader) have little idea how to truly help people. They hide egregious acts of hostility from other managers and despite interviewing you and hiring you, do not think you are capable of doing your job. They talk down to you and talk at you as opposed to asking how things are going and how they can help. Most of the employees are drones and could care less. The company all of a sudden cares about it's employees (they use the term: team members, haha!) when they get destroyed publicly for ripping off customers across a number of lines of business and forcing employees to make sales. Working there with all of the horrible publicity and having a branch manager with no affluent experience be in charge of me (as a Premier Banker) has hurt my business and really opened my eyes in a negative manner. I would not recommend Wells Fargo at all. That is my experience at my branch, I know some branches aren't all bad. We've had almost double digit HR complaints against the same manager and he hasn't even been moved to another branch... the DM and ASL knew about it and did nothing."
bad,"Worked part-time but ended up being full time because they were always short staffed. Turn over was extremely high. All they cared about was you getting ""sales"".  Very harsh environment and not fun at all."
bad,"Wells Fargo only cares abut the bottom line! Forget your health  and deaths you have in the family...come back to work and hit the floor running no mercy!! "
bad,"Where do I begin- Wells Fargo was an absolute nightmare to work for. If you were not part of the 'in crowd' and your did not push a sale with every single customer, you were treated very differently. "
bad,"-high stress"
bad,"This company is very corporate environment. They tend to treat employees like we are 5. Lots of micro-management. A lot of redundancy in the work. Repeating, duplicating the same information and data in several places.  There was no fluid work flow in the processes. Managers seem to add more redundancy rather than try and streamline the process. This added a lot of unnecessary work that took up valuable time. "
bad,"i loved the company until all the scams,, i was so embarrassed to to work there, i just couldn’t do it anymore "
bad,"Branch management was lazy, upper management was a gossip mill that used intimidation to try to get people to stay when notices of resignation were given. Sales goals were still pushed even after the scandal and the company EXPLICITLY stating that there would be no sales goals or numbers."
bad,Promotions were only given for up selling which I did not agree with.  Selling things to people to put them more in debt was ridiculous and unnecessary
bad,this company makes you use your PTO even if you do not want to and don't ever ask for a Saturday off if you work them . They give you the PTO from day one and then if you quit or get terminated you have to pay back to the company what was not accrued . This is not a good thing . We should be able to choose when we use the PTO not be made use it .
bad,"They allow for employees to be victims of harassment and bullying on a continuous bases by all levels of management. Human Resources does not react or investigate when being notified, they include and promote the very people that are responsible for the daily abuse of other employees. They do not protect their workers that are victims of the actions of others."
bad,poor management  no job security it is a consist more more more they dont care anything about there employees. They are just numbers. Easy come easy go
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"My peers were awesome, strong, and positive. But we knew things were spiraling at a fast pace and management was very evasive with facts. We weren’t ever given real reasons as to why the cfpb was in our site. But with speculation, we all knew."
bad,"Great company to build relationships with customers, but not a company that is conducive to learning or growing.  Company needs better training methods."
bad,"I would never encourage anyone to work for Wells Fargo. Between micromanagement, unrealistic sales goals, and no way to advance unless you kiss ____....RUN RUN RUN!"
bad,It’s too stressful for the amount of compensation that they provide to their employees. It is a place where they don’t value their employees it’s a lot more talk than actual employees value
bad,"Most of these points that one is to give an opinion on are already in the news media. Wells Fargo has not learned from the lawsuits, not from it penalties by the government. Something major has to happen before the bank can be an ethical institution trusted with public property."
bad,"When you leave they take your loan and you dont get paid on them!!!"
bad,"They promise long term assignments but never deliver. They don't offer any incentives like vacation time or profit sharing. Agent reps don't send you on interviews which your skills are best used for. Overall, the reps work on a commission and they low ball you on hourly rates."
bad,High pressure sale which cause Wells Fargo to be in the position the are in. Management tends to favor others. Low ball rises and the benefits are terrible. Very hard to move up unless you have connections.  Was treated unfairly by upper management.They were hard to work for no direction from the management
bad,Worst company I've ever worked for.  They were finally exposed for the frauds they are (upper management) when all of the news broke about corruption.
bad,Work environment was very stressful.  Employees are treated like robots.  Upper management only cares about making money. Management sets unreal expectations.
bad,"Was told in multiple interviews that copywriting would be part of the job responsibilities. It was not and the role turned out to be be a glorified QA role. Management was only concerned about their own career advancement and couldn't care less about yours. I could go on and on, but throw in the company's recent scandals, and I would rather be unemployed for the rest of my life than ever work for Wells Fargo."
bad,Management was bad.  No chance for advancement.  Don't care about their employees or clients.  Lower level employees were underpaid.  Horrible business model.
bad,I did not like working for a company where my immediate supervisor would come to work hungover from drinking or getting high the night before.  The branch manager was taking steroids and would go into rages randomly.  Not a good work environment on any level.
bad,dresscode is very strict. They require you to come into work dressed in a suit everyday on low wages. the sales goals are ridiculous and your job depends on it. They teach you how to Make up accounts that customers dont need.
bad,"Interaction with high value rated customers included customer service, sales, and answering account and banking related questions. Call Center environmet."
bad,"I came into Apple One and was placed at Wells Fargo. I was upfront with my availability due to my status as a student. They placed me in a position that did not agree with my availability, they practically sold me on one set hour and did a bait and switch afterward. Plus Wells Fargo sucks to work for. Needless to say, this didn't work out."
bad,Wells Fargo management  doesn’t play fair at all  they have no consideration for others people play favorites very unprofessional nobody on the same page information is inputting wrong
bad,"Things are always changing, no say in your hours, always finding ways to write people up to get rid of them. Changing schedules and making you work certain shifts with not even a month heads up. Management will tell you to apply for certain jobs and keep pushing you but you never get promoted unless you're part of ""the circle""."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"it is a sad place to work. they will lie to you and to your clients "
bad,No freedom to express your opinions or ideas. No promotions advancement seen in the future. This company was still goal based in many ways. Customers still gave a lot of backlash.
bad,Management pressure employees to sell customers products they may not really need to meet quotas every quarter. For every sell an employee makes will go to their quarterly bonus.  They treat their employees like another number but want employees to go over and beyond for customers.  They also lie about their culture diversity.  They are given money based on how culturally diverse they are.  They also play the blame game when any discrepancy occurs.  It's never anyone's fault therefor the issue just escalates.
bad,"Typical day as a manager was multiple conference calls about what you're going to accomplish each day.. the WF culture was sell, sell, sell, sell.. in a small town you only see the same people most days.. goals were unrealistic, went from a service industry to a cut throat what have you done for me today industry.. and you saw from the news and backlash what happened at Wells-Fargo when they encourage that environment."
bad,"Basic teller work"
bad,"Wells Fargo only cares about the numbers. Not the actual person working. Management that should even be management. Inside politics and favorites. Your experience varies depends on what department you land in, and who your manager is."
bad,"Learned a lot dealing with customers and loved the customers ."
bad,Constant misinformation for both employees and customers. Next to impossible to fulfill simple requests because of over complexity of simple processes.
bad,Awesome people and work environment!  I love working here!  This is a company that cares for employees.  They have great training and want their employees to achieve success.
bad,"Wells Fargo does not offer any significant managerial support for its employees, particularly its IT workers. Projects and tasks are assigned with virtually no understanding of what resources they might require, and when workers come forward to ask for support, their requests are usually denied or ignored. This leads to a work culture where supervisors routinely tell their people that ""I don't care what you need to do, just get it done."" A truly unhealthy environment in which to work."
bad,The work load and communication to employees planned out by business stakeholders is poorly managed and planned.  Employees are forced to take blame for poor management decisions.  Wells Fargo continues to layoff employees and contractors as a cost cutting measure due to poor management decisions.
bad,"Management does not care about the work load. You must participate in worthless meetings that are not even related to your work functions. Then, you need to put a lot of hours to meet the datelines."
bad,I was employed here for 11+ years and was fired for not meeting a constantly changing quality expectation.  It was a way for the company to fire longer tenured employees with out having to pay severances.  My manager couldn't offer support and was only concerned about saving her own job.
bad,"Management is toxic and incompetent. Frequent harassment. WFC frequently violates its own policies and treats workers poorly, workers have almost no recourse to complain."
bad,"Working there you are often left to defend for yourself with little support from upper management. "
bad,Working for Wells Frgo was very stressful I was very unhappy there. The pay was not good for the amount of work they wanted you to do. I wouldnt reccomend this employer to anyone.
bad,"Fantastic immediate team; however, upper-level management seems to be intent on overworking all of the team members. Upper management seems to now understand what the work entails, and is not cooperative."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Wells Fargo is just a plac where you only advance by deceiving and brown nosing and being best friends with management I've seen well qualified employees rejected over qualified
bad,"Wells Fargo struggles to keep their values with their employees . They're management team is unprofessional, and they pay does not fit the hours we are required to work ."
bad,"Wells Fargo doesn't invest in its people, it is not about longevity. It is about the dollar.  As you see with the scandal with Wells Fargo....they manage with the fear of being terminated at every turn."
bad,Wells Fargo is not the best place to work. They are constantly on you to perform and sell the product to the customer even if the customer does not want/need it. It is a high stress position with no real support from management.
bad,Wells Fargo provides a diverse environment and the ability to build wonderful relationships however management tend to forget the importance of making their employees feel like more than just a number.
bad,Management does not care about there team. Its all depends on your district the hardest part about working for Wells Fargo if you stand up for yourself and what's right according to ethics you will get punished and they will not let you grow
bad,"Wells Fargo's culture is built on unethical behavior and the good old boys club. If you don't play along or have a unique idea that is different from management you are immediately shut-down. HR is not on the side of the employees, they support management and don't take the time to investigate claims of hostile environments and discrimination."
bad,I disliked every thing about this place. I hated how customers were treated and hated the way employees were treated. Place was full of high school drama and unprofessional leaders. Not a place I would recommend to anyone
bad,"Wells Fargo is a great organization.  Unfortunately this particular branch is run so incompetently that you dread going to work, until you finally quit.  I was one of three people that quit in a month and they employ 6 people.  The GM is downright evil and is the most incompetent person I ever worked for."
bad,"I worked in the call center which really sucked. Management was horrible, they only cared about stats and didn't care how you did it. They almost encouraged you to lie and scam customers. They had no care for the people who banked with wells fargo, they only care about money and how they look on paper. They did a lot of sketchy things and had no regard for it. They treat employees horribly."
bad,"Warehouse-lockbox. Inconsistent hours, management, and benefits. Only great part of benefits are the dental. Pto hours are combined, no separate sick and vacation. Women have to stay for years to advance. Inconsistent hours means even worse pay. Modern day sweatshop. No drug test are given pre-hire. Dress code and work conditions, disgusting."
bad,Employees are disposable tools you dont see anyone last long there because the turn over rate is horrible they treat you like you dont matter and the sales quotas are so unrealistic unethical place to work the compensations have dropped to less than 300  i did get experience from my manager and help develop my skills but other than that nothing good to say about working for them.
bad,Low pay for a huge workload. No advancement no matter how hard you work. They reward the employees that do the min amount of work. Very frustrating.
bad,The company has an awful culture.  Also has horrible leadership.  Most managers there are idiots and control freaks.  Really despicable company.
bad,Wells Fargo is too pushy on sales. The customers have complained several times about coming in the bank and being harrassed by the employees to the point they won't to close their accounts. The happiness and loyalty of the customer is at the bottom of their list. The management is the worst I have ever seen. They come and go as they please and do whatever they want when they want. They bully their employees and they let their position as an authority figure go to their heads. It is a very stressful place to work. I love the type of work I was doing but hated going to work every day because of the way I was treated and how my job was threatened because of sales quotas not being met every single day. HR was also a pain to deal with and the district manager only cared about numbers and herself. If you reported an issue to HR it never got ressolved. They always tried to find a way to keep you from getting your quarterly  bonus too. I will never work for this company again. I would not recommend it to anyone.
bad,Good company to move up in if you know someone. Don't really care if you're qualified for a job and don't have loyalty to hard workers.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Wells Fargo phone banking is a stressful position. Management does not care about anything but numbers. The sales goals are intense and unrealistic. Customers are hounded to get something sold to them on each call! There are many metrics to meet everyday and bonus is hard to reach now that the company is changing things."
bad,"They only care about money and don't understand that in order to make and keep your customers happy, you have to start by making your employees happy. They use their employees and when they are done, they discard them. They set unrealistic job expectations and the only form of motivation is threatening your employment. They use Gallup for surveys once a year and bribe employees to score high."
bad,The mortgage crisis was in full effect when I worked for Wells Fargo Mortgage. Loan programs were constantly changing and it seemed no one was on the same page. I would not work for them again and would highly recommend the same for others who are seeking long term employment.
bad,"If you have a pipeline of past clients that you can tap into for new loans, you should work for a lender that pays 4 times what Wells Fargo does. Why? Because you will get virtually no business from any other source. So why be obligated to meet Wells' demands on your time? And get paid so little?"
bad,"This place is like working at a prison. They offer you employment as a Customer Service Rep. The only thing they want  you to do is shove product down customers throats. Metric driven work force. Don't work here, unless it is your only option."
bad,"-if you like being a number this is the place for you"
bad,"The culture started out to be great fun. It was lucrative, competitive and attractive.  Soon after the interest rates fell many people were fired or laid off.  It was the nature of the mortgage sales trend."
bad,"Company has been around forever. Most employees have not. If one person does not like you, youll be managed out. Constant daily changes. You could sell 1,000,000.00 in new loans in one day but you'll be reprimanded for not opening a checking account that day. Keep ALL documentation...it could save you from being charged with a crime you did not commit. If you are ready to sell your soul, you have a desk chair or teller station still warm from the last person open for you."
bad,"-Repetitive tasks"
bad,"Took application with applicant over the phone, ran and evaluated credit report, determine vehicle value and worked up quote(s) for client.  Discussed terms of offer(s), submitted to underwritters.  If approved gave final figures, terms and total payoff information.  Offered auto payment deduction form a WF account and GAP on vehcile.  Scheduled appointment at selected bank brach with loan officer.  If bank branch unavailable in are prepared for ""loan by mail"" and processed documents."
bad,"stressful mornings with impossible to get ethically goals for the day, very unfair and late nights punishments for not making goals unethically like other branches did for the day "
bad,"Having someone stand behind you and record every word you say to a customer, then tell you what you should have said even if you have just met the customer for the first time.  Trying to sell every customer something when they don't need it or desire it."
bad,I worked for Wachovia Love it. Wells Fargo not so. Worked for a bank.
bad,"Great every customer, stay in window, balance cash drawer,"
bad,"Shaky management, unethical culture, pushy sales tactics. I've been nothing but disappointed with how we are made to treat our customers. If you do not have 100k+ in our bank...then you're not worth our time and effort."
bad,Worked for Wells Fargo for a year and a half in various positions as a contractor. These positions included everything from processing and closing to full underwriting of no/low risk conventional loans and some FHA and VA underwriting training.
bad,"It was a great job until Wells Fargo took over Wachovia.  Sales are expected every minute of everyday.  Micro-management to the max.  Their ""inside"" motto was either coach them up or coach them out.  Nothing like working 60 hours and only getting paid for 40."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"There is a strange atmosphere of doublespeak and outright deception, every minute of your day is monitored and every mistake reviewed by multiple managers.  Turnover is very high, few people work there an entire year.  The focus of the job is NOT customer service, but only selling unrelated banking products to angry customers who want help with mortgage related issues.  Every single day you will witness unethical if not illegal behavior on the part of other Wells Fargo entities, coworkers, and supervisors."
bad,This was a temp job not much to say about it. great place to work. wish it wasn't a temp job
bad,I was placed with this company through one of their many temp agencies a few times. They do not appreciate their employees at all and have layoffs/turnover constantly.
bad,I enjoy this company and love the employee's. I no longer can work the hours of my shirt is the reason for leaving.
bad,"Poor management, many employees were terminated without given a fair opportunity to display their ability to perform exceptionally.  The mortgage department has been under several management teams, all unsuccessful.  This department has shut down on numerous occasions.  Compensation was not appropriate for the role of a loan processor/closer.  Employees did not receive proper time to train and learn the job and systems."
bad,"This is without a doubt the worst company I have ever worked for. The total lack of concern for anything but making more money from their customers is shameful. The way employees are treated is unfair, the way customers are treated is unethical, and the lies told to both are unconscionable. Calling this job customer service is a total misnomer. What the main concern, and the only objective for this company, is to sell additional, unneeded products to their customers. If the customer says they don't want the product, the employee is told they MUST overcome the customer's objections or face the consequences (a write-up and threat of dismissal). I understand that the company is in business to make money, but if the customer says no, NO means NO! I would not recommend this company to anyone. The pay is borderline, the benefits are mediocre and the management doesn't give a dam# about their employees, other than what bonuses they can earn off their backs."
bad,Never got an opportunity to advance despite hitting goals 3 years consecutively. They always pull from the outside
bad,"I read the reviews above and wanted to say ""What Wells Fargo did you work at?"" Wells Fargo management is terrible. We had this guy who was on a verge of getting fired. He already had 2 warnings. Next thing you know he gets promoted to a sr. loan doc specialist, then to the team lead, and then to a manager. My production was 103% the first year and 119% the second year. I was there for 5 yrs. Within 5 yrs after asking, if not begging for a raise/promotion I got a 55 cents raise. I did work hard, but that didn't matter to the management. I was great at what I did. People who got fired the month before would go to a career fare and get hired again for more money. Are you kidding ???? Yes, they give you somewhat of a bonus after they work you to death.  I wanted to meet with a manager to develop a plan to move to a next level. S/he wouldn't even meet with me. "
bad,"Started out as Part time to ""help"" them out. Then it became full time (PLUS!) Worked as brokers assistant to hold job for a friend who had health issues. (She decided NOT to return to work) Only job I ever gave notice at. The hardest part was controlling my tongue when I came out of the restroom & my ""boss"" was standing there telling me his phone was ringing. (After I gave my notice, I told him to go answer it!) I was made to cry on a daily basis & yelled at in front of everyone in the office. One of the other brokers assistants called the Home Office to report him."
bad,They just has 4 supervisors resigned in the last 4 months. Poor work environment. There are better paying collection manager jobs out their at this time. Do not apply
bad,"Poor management"
bad,"Most of the jobs they hire for now are temp to hire positions. They lead you to believe that you are almost certainly guaranteed a full time job. While a temp you get no benefits- no pto- no holiday pay. You are extremely expendable to them. "
bad,"Here are some reason why NOT to work for Wells Fargo:"
bad,"Maybe for me it was the particular branch that I worked in but it was very disorganized. You get thrown into everything very quickly, then chastised for not knowing what to do or not doing everything correctly. It was always a revolving door of people, no one stays very long. Constant pressure to sell people bank accounts everyday."
bad,"When Wells Fargo took over Wachovia every employee was excited with the great match both of these companies would be.  We were WRONG!!!  For 10 years running Wachovia achieved number 1 in customer satisfaction once Wells came in we lost it.  Wells is more about quantity rather than quality.  A $100 account is celebrated with the same enthusiasm as a $100k account.  Wells rather that you open in one branch 100 accounts a day, because you are loosing about 95 accounts a day.  Customers are not satisfied so they close their accounts as soon as they open them.  There is no work life for managers, you need to be in at 8 am and closing is at 6 pm and Saturdays are included as well.  As a manager I had to be on conference calls for what felt like the entire day to see how the progress was on account openings as well as the ""flavor of the month"".  Then once closing that's when you can play cathc up with your own work.  I usually left around 8:30 pm everyday.  I was not happy with them they micro manage like a retail store and don't let employees think for themselves.  Plus the comp was horrible.  Not worth all the work."
bad,"waiting on high volume of customers, I learned how to assert myself, the most enjoyable part is meeting new and interesting people"
bad,The personal banker position is a joke. Unless you are in a super small town stay away from this position.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,really bad management cares more about bottom line than meeting customer needs. They oversell products that don't fit client needs
bad,Prepared to be stressed everyday after work. horrible management.
bad,"The salary is absolutely horrible, with performance bonuses completely out of reach. There is little to no chance for advancement, even while I was pursuing my Master's degree. Management is completely untruthful with advancement opportunities to keep you as an indentured servant as long as possible. Overall Wells Fargo treats their internal customers as poorly as their external customers."
bad,Benefits and compensation sucks. Management looks at employees as numbers instead of a person. They ask a lot but don't want to pay employees.
bad,"The goals are not realistic, training was horrible, work environment not safe or updated, huge roaches in the bathrooms, carpet has multiple rips and extreme allergens. Customer file information not kept electronically but with paper and not secure at any time from other co-workers. Work environment is like working in a hock shop. 18 people to a 10 x 10 space. Very low class on the mortgage side vs WF investors."
bad,"it was a terrible job, nothing to brag about. the hardest part is meeting their ridiculous sales goals that is nearly impossible to meet ergo with very little pay-was clearing barely 300 every two weeks. only lasted 1 month there & said auf wiedersehen!"
bad,You never know if you have a job when you leave. My co-workers from my training class where great and the most enjoyable part of the job was the clients
bad,WORST JOB I'VE EVER HAD and possibly will ever have had.
bad,Worked here briefly as a high school student. The work place was not well managed and had constant back and forth drama. Would not recommend.
bad,"The COMPANY over ALL SUCKS. Management will stay on you all day about meeting goals and they have no idea on how to begin reaching the. You have people in the same position for years who are bitter and angry because they can not advance which puts a damper on everybody day. I went from CSSR to PB and got a BS raise, with a TON of responsibilites. I am only still with the company b/c I am moving soon and little do my manager know, I will transfer and move into the position I always wanted. Every company just about sucks but the money is ok. I know a few positions that are overpaid and underworked. I will be in one soon."
bad,"I worked at WF for 15 years and started back in California. Recently I was fired based on false and exaggerated charges. They didn't even follow WF's own guidelines - just goodbye and hit the road. All insurance..gone, no severance, no notice, nothing. If they treat a 15 year team member like that, they will not hesitate to fire you instantly."
bad,"Low Pay, No Culture (unless you count threatening people) people laid off all the time, one time it was 75% of my department. Management is terrible and has no clue what they are doing. People quit all the time. Nobody is happy working here."
bad,"This was the worst job I have ever had. I was so sick of the treatment from management, the invasive questions about why I had to take ONE day off for a personal emergency that I walked out of that disgusting excuse of a bank and never looked back."
bad,"They train you to be fake to your customers, there sales goals are outragousley unobtainable, it is impossible to move up unless you kiss upper managements dareair, it is extremley micro managed and stressful."
bad,I never would have left my previous job had I known how terrible it was going to be here.
bad,"Numbers oriented, they dont care about your home life....not a place to work if you are family oriented and have children!!!!!"
bad,"I worked in the Lockbox Department and it was by far THE WORST job I EVER had!!!!! The work environment is undesirable. I worked around a lot of gossipping women. They gossipped about their personal life down to their itimate details..they gossipped each other and vice versa...Friend A and B talked about Friend C...when Friend A was absent, B and C talked about A,,,and so on. Just recently saw a job post for the exact position I had that's paying 9.69/hr. DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I mean you can flip burgers at In and Out for 10/hr...what a joke! Entirely too much work for such little pay. There were days I went in to start my 7am shift but wouldn't get out until 8pm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes, that's correct...and you only GET A 30 MINUTE LUNCH BREAK...You may or may not get a break!"
bad,"When companies merge, changes are not always good. There were many changes, many people let go and benefits were destroyed."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"When I first was hired I was relieved to have found a full time job. After working for Wells Fargo at least on the production side it is a hard job with no compensation. Any complaints brought to management do not get resolved in my experience. They expect you to sit do your work and no food, or drink on the floor. The only time you can get up is if its break or lunch time. They do not give you the tools you need to complete the job at hand. They require 8 hours of production time and base your numbers off of that but they don't take into account the first 30 minutes of the day we are waiting for direction, then you have your break which is 15 min, then lunch is 45 min. We work till 2:30 pm but the lead calls last box at 1:45 which cuts into your 8 hours of production time."
bad,"I hated it there. Hours were ridiculous, and it seemed like the greed level was insane. I didn't like the person I was becoming by working there. They were uncaring, greedy, selfish people. I would never work for them or as a collector ever again."
bad,"Worked for Wachovia and was very happy. After converting to Wells Fargo, there were a lot of changes. Changes are to be expected during a conversion but I felt that it was very unorganized and management never seemed to have answers to any questions we had. You could count on walking in every morning and finding out that whatever you were told to do the previous day, was not correct. Many of the employees are extremely stressed and have anxiety issues. It is very easy to forget who you are when you work for them."
bad,"My opinion, so take it with a grain of salt. In my experience at WF they treated people as if they were replaceable commodities. Beat you over the head for numbers and if you fail to produce, they spit you out. People game the system all the time and yet the leadership is not held accountable to integrity, attrition and so the only goal is numbers any which way you get them. Tell me what the sense is for Jump into January why a family member needs to have 7 accounts? Other than to for the banker to hit their numbers with accounts that will not generate any relationships or revenue?"
bad,"Nothing in particular, I really enjoyed my position and my team but got laid off unfortunately. Great people I use to work with, I miss them and having a team that close."
bad,Wells Fargo only cares about the board and its shareholders.  Pay is low and they are continually looking for ways to cut compensation to employees.  They are vague on job description when hiring and promise promotion which doesn't happen.  There is no such thing as a raise and their compensation is low for a person with my experience. I feel as though they have me locked and trying to keep me from advancing as long as possible.
bad,The culture was not up to par as many of my other jobs. I didn’t feel comfortable with any of upper management nor did they take the time to introduce themselves
bad,"While there are a few good positions and managers within the company, much of the company is only focused on numbers and micro managed to the point of exhaustion. Not advisable."
bad,"Employees stab their team members in the back to gain advantage."
bad,asdjhkl; this pklace was abusive and usedme and my co workers. it was all about sales even though I worked in service as a banker. I would never work there again.
bad,Watched management at different banks scream and yell at employees while customers were present. Every week someone was quitting. Ridiculous workload for how little we were paid.
bad,Advancement is based on who you know and not based on your qualifications. They are bias is people to work for since old management left. manger in Hempstead is the worst ever she will throw you under the bus if need be
bad,"they are not considerate of their employees personal time. The compensation for the work we do is not enough for the amount of work being done. Also, there are not many growing opportunities as promised"
bad,I was one that got caught up in the scandal of opening accounts without people's knowledge.  I had 3 accounts open in my name and wasn't aware until I left.
bad,Management is horrific. No support and no encouragement for improving efficiency in business processes. Most of upper-management create a clique to protect their job titles. It's a hostile work environment despite HR being notified.
bad,"The PLL department is soul crushing. Management will tell you they are focused on developing a career path for you, but are just patronizing so you won't quit. Constant abuse from customers and zero support from managers. PTO, no sick leave, ridiculous tardy and absence policies that do not apply to credit card collections or other departments, no flexibility. In other departments,  you can flex time and have up to 6 minutes before you are late. PLL, one minute over counts against you. If you are one minute late five times, you will be written up ""informally"", six times formally and then, fired. If you are going to be two minutes late and are risking  a write up, your best option would be to call off completely since that is a different occurrence system. Unapproved leave for more than an hour like calling off sick is an occurrence.  It’s pretty much having to miss an entire day of work because they are not flexible on you being late one or two minutes, even with snow. How does that make sense? Everything is timed, micromanaged. If you go to the bathroom while not on break, be prepared to explain why you were off the phone for more than five minutes. Your supervisor meetings will be the same: explain why you took more than 5 minutes between a call. Customers always complain about lack of transparency and other issues like communicating between different lines of business, which in honesty, is a total mess even for employees. You can’t see what other departments do and must transfer customers multiple times. Management does not care how hard you work. You are replaceable and"
bad,There is a reason why the FDIC has a memorandum of understanding for over 2 years and that's because nothing much has changed. It's the same pressure antics as before. I would never recommend anyone working there.
bad,I cannot speak for every branch but this was some of the most trying work experience I’ve ever had. The branch manager was difficult to deal with on a daily basis and having to hound customers to open new accounts was dreadful.
bad,"literally the worst place I have ever worked. There is no flexibility on hours, and no option to work remotely. People are criticised for being proactive. Micromanagement is rife and poor management at that. Communication no existent. And if you try and make a move to a better department, it gets blocked even when you’re the best candidate just in case it upsets the current manager. An awful bank with outdated working practices."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Don't go for any money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"This was the worst place I’ve ever worked. Everyday was a stressful micromanagement and widget counting nightmare. There was no respect given. Employees are treated as slaves bringing in numbers for the company and made to feel useless if not selling an outrageous amount of accounts a day. An employee was only as good as the numbers brought in any given day. If an employee doesnt produce sales, they are stuck in the lobby as a greeter. This further sabotages them from producing going forward."
bad,"Great pay, but they do not care about their employees.  If you are a single parent you are pretty much punished for missed time if your children are sick."
bad,"Beware. Terrible culture as evidenced by how often they're sued for unethical behavior.  If you need a job for a while and can make it a year, you'll get a few months of severance when they have a layoff."
bad,"Definitely work here if you want the following. Absolutely NO real training, understanding of finance, advancement, respect for others personal information, (Will find some in regular trash) no job security, non stop HR violations and high risk of loss because dual control is a joke there."
bad,Verified if loan defaulted on were able to be charged off or foreclosed. The process has now been automized as it should have been from the beginning. They cut staff and my position was removed
bad,"Worst morale ever. If you are looking for a company where people work together and get a long...keep on looking...Wells is not the place for you. If you like to be bullied, put down, told how horrible of a person you are, then this is the place for you. There is no communication between co-workers and the client is never 1st. Trust me when I say that everyone that works here dislikes each other."
bad,"I worked for Wells Fargo Advisors, primarily in The Private Bank location.  And my remarks are directed at the employees and management of both those segments of Wells Fargo. While working with the clients was very rewarding, it wasn’t enough to keep me at this dreadful company. The management style of this organization led to led to unprofessional behavior within the lower level of employees the like of which I’ve never observed in over 30 years of working in multiple and varying industries. I would not recommend this company. What was reported over the last several years about this company and its poor treatment of its employees, is true, at least in my experience."
bad,"The production floor is filled with unsatisfied workers or people only there for compensation. Little forward progression, and rampant privacy breeches. It is a poor work culture and one with employees actively against or frustrated with the company. I departed the company after my personal finances were brought into question which included questioning over the company's own machines and systems failing."
bad,"I put 3 years into that company. Working in their call center was horrible. None of the managers followed the mission. They cared more about the customers with money than the ones that didn't. I traveled an hour to work everyday. Im autistic and they recently fired me, without giving me a reason."
bad,If you want a life please do not choose to work at Wells Fargo. They will take your blood if you allow it............................................................
bad,Too much work for low pay. Was not worth it. Too much information to learn. I can tell they have a high turn over rate in this dept. they expect a lot from their employees
bad,"This company isn't set up to accommodate the needs of the single mother or struggling family unit. They have a point system and I worked under them as a temp. I developed a very bad kidney infection and kidney stones. Once my doctor cleared me to return, I was informed by the temp agency that I had exceeded the maximum 6 points allowed with the attendance policy. I had every type of medical excuse and even provided them the approval letter from my ST AFLAC disability claim and was denied to reapply for a year."
bad,"A lot may have changed after they got in trouble in 2016 but prior to, this was the worst company to ever work for. Being responsible for inflated goals that were unsustainable is not an ideal situation. No wonder the scandal. And if you didn’t hit an unsustainable goal, not only are you questioned by your boss but also the regional manager telling you how bad you are on a regional call. Avoid."
bad,"For 22 years I worked at this ""financial institution"" working my way up from project manager & business analyst to operations manager overseeing ACAT's, Trading, Online Platform, Reorg, Dividends & Clearance. Unfortunately, most of these departments moved to other cities during mergers. Wachovia (prior to merging with Wells) still managed to keep talent where I was then asked to head up a relationship for a large trading partner netting the firm approx $1.5mm profit per year. Then came Wells Fargo. In my 30+ years of working for wall street based firms I never encountered a culture, business model, back stabbing inept management as Wells. They decided to jettison my trading partnership based on reputational risk because the other firm was ""not within the Wells umbrella and control"". This ended my relationship management role which left me with the only choice of working a retail desk for high net worth and high velocity traders. (pay cut number 1). We were removed from salary (bonus eligible) to hourly ""but don't worry - you can get all of the overtime you need - right?"" WRONG! Suddenly, no OT! We were also STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to cross sell to our clients. (pay cut number 2). A grid was employed and if you didn't hit their numbers you took a hard hit. An impossible task unless you ""manufactured"" leads. You know - lie, cheat, steal to produce acceptable numbers! It's impossible to try to cross sell a limited audience. Most of our clients we spoke to at least once a day and many multiple times a day. If you can figure out a way to cross sell someone who calls 8 times a day, honestly,"
bad,"The 2600 bldg. is maxed out in space and new hires are working out of conference room which makes it impossible to be on conference calls at the same time as the other colleagues.  Not a team friendly environment - other floors will not share coffee, cups, or silverware w/1st floor.. WF as a whole should provide minimal coffee for all floors."
bad,Was employed during account scandal as phone sales rep. Worst and almost first job I was going to leave without new job lined up. The was no moral integrity in sales environment.
bad,There is a good reason they keep ending up in front of the senate. The management pushes to make more money for the company no matter the cost. They do not value their employees at all.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"The culture at wellsfargo auto customer service department is very poor , huge favoritism plays a key role is customer service , you are shunned for speaking out about policy changes and the way management treats their employees, some supervisors are not compassionate, they do not practice the same culture thatheyhold us accountable for us h"
bad,Wells Fargo's leaders focused on short-term  financial metrics and not long-term sustainable results. There was a general lack of accountability and lack of vision.
bad,"Wells Fargo had far too many promises and not enough follow through. They claim work life balance but it was not. I was hired to not work Saturdays as my branch was not open for business, however we were sent out to help other stores that were open on Saturdays."
bad,"Online csr is a trap! You get paid the same as everybody else to do twice as much. overdraft fees your problem card declined for verification and customer is angry and embarrassed your problem, monthly service fees your problem, bill pay not received your problem, cant get online your problem, zelle, wire, bank to bank not working or cant send enough money your problem, cant get apple pay or cash app set up your problem, check is on hold and they really need the money your problem, they did not receive a direct deposit or a refund from a merchant your problem, unable to raise a limit on their debit card so they can spend their own money your problem. People signing up for loan companies and gym memberships and then getting mad when the money comes out of their account your problem for not stopping it."
bad,"Branch manager is a sociopath.  Was promised a raise through recruiting, yet had to fight tooth and nail to get what they promised.  The Branch manager simply did NOT manage, nor do anything to add to the success of the branch.  Terrible and incompetent leadership."
bad,"I know what abusive parents are and that's about as professional as Wells Fargo management gets."
bad,"I have been with the company for over 3 years. I found out, I was training new employees who where making more money then myself. Now as a lead teller they are doing it again. There is know one to advocate for you, when these issues come up. The district managers are MIA, for the people on the front lines taking the abuse from customers, for the bad decisions of the company. They only care about the employees making them lots of money, for the corporate people and the share holders. This job has made me sad, angry, frustrated and depressed. I have been working for 39 years and this is the worst company I have ever worked for!"
bad,The management inside and outside the office are corrupt and do not follow the policies and procedures. And if you are not in the click then your not apart of the team. They talk about customers especially the poorer customers and the ones with disabilities.  They do not protect their people and do not understand family crisis even a death or sick family member. I would not ever recommend working for this company or banking with this company. They have no compassion and the job is just a pay check to them.
bad,"My commute to work was 2hours coming and 2hours going, teller training was the only training I was given, I was the only employee that was made to work 6 days a week (branch has Saturday hours), management had a personal dislike for me and made my time there miserable, the work culture was stressful and I did not enjoy my time as an employee with this company."
bad,Wells Fargo is not a friendly company to work for. The culture is about do whatever it takes to opening accounts and products the customers may or may not need.
bad,"Poor, incompetent and inexperienced low level managers that think they are smarter than their more experienced subordinates.  Unrealistic expectations of daily production.  These comments apply only to the numerous transplants from other states that are too thin skinned to deal with realistic New Yorkers that stand up for themselves and speak up when they see wrongdoing. Raises, if any, are an insult. The best workers don’t even receive an annual raise that comes close to a cost of living increase. Social Security recipients get a higher raise every year. Trying to take a day off is a constant challenge to get a manager to approve it even though these same managers rarely put in a full week without taking a day off or comes in late or leaves early at least once or twice every week. If you do happen to receive a job offer from this office RUN AS FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN AND AS RUN AS FAST AS POSSIBLE before these people crush your spirit.  Sweat shop atmosphere."
bad,"Phony management, gives dual message of ""do everything to take care of customers"" and then tie your hands from doing it.  What you'll find working for Wells Fargo, is your just a butt in a chair doing what one manager said - 'what we could train monkeys to do'.  They are more interested in the profit/loss statement so they can get their bonuses.  They hire MBA's to figure out complicated sales compensation plans that are unrealistic and benefit the company over the sales person.  Then, if / when someone breaks through the comp plan incentives, they get all bothered by it, and revise it again to try to make it even harder.  I've been in sales for 25 years, 7 at Wells Fargo - and WF was only place where Sales Managers hated when their sale people made more money then them.  Everywhere else, managers knew they chose management to have a steadier, but lower income. Glad I don't work their anymore... this company will crush your soul, and do it with a smile.  If the news reports about Wells Fargo from the past 5 years don't scare you enough, I hope this review will!"
bad,"Ever sense the “scandal” came out, Wells Fargo lost its backbone and doesn’t know how to effectively drive a sales force. They now let social media and CNN reporters dictate how the company will be ran. Everyone knows how banks make money and there’s nothing wrong with that. But when the bank stops encouraging people to make their money, and then turns around to encourage them to start making it again then wonder why they are not that effective after constantly telling them they will not get fired if they just try, it doesn’t work. There is no way to gauge your success, no way to separate yourself, it’s all about how much your manager likes you. It’s irritating, unrewarding, and quite frankly embarrassing. The board of Wells Fargo couldn’t effectively run a lemon aid stand."
bad,"This company hired me through the temp agency. They constantly told me about advancement opportunities that would be available after my contract ended. They talked about ""tons of projects"" in the upcoming weeks as my contract was coming to an end. Then they let me know they wouldn't be continuing my contract at 2 weeks out. We parted amicably and I was asked to finish my projects during that time. They then called the agency as soon as they confirmed I was done with the projects (1.5wks ahead of my contract ending), and terminated my contract immediately by insulting me personally and making up lies."
bad,Unethical company with clearly one-sided political views that are consistently shoved down your throat with no opt out. Management was unhelpful and department seemed disorganized.
bad,They hire in mass quantity then wait to see who survives after time. Pressure on 'cross selling' mortgages to existing mortgage holders. This is not revealed until a few weeks after you go live on the the floor. You Do have a quota to meet; not told in advanced and not at $14/per hr!
bad,This company has a lot to offer as far as business sense and how money moves in America but the culture and the sales pressure is down right toxic I know they have had major changes since I've been there but such a sour taste was left I would never want to work for them again and even personally bank with them anymore.
bad,"Typical large company with typically-incompetent management.  Very little evidence of management competency in planning, organizing, leading, and controlling processes.  Lots of regurgitation of the latest pop psychology ""leadership"" buzzwords and catchphrases."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Not the best job I've had. The product was losing in a market that was hit buy the economic downturn. If you lost Equity in your home there is 0 chance of a reveres mtg.
bad,"A typical day for me included opening to closing without a lunch hour to support the branch, the employees and customers. I learned many skills working at Wells Fargo. The workplace culture is horrible.The hardest part of the job was dealing with co workers who wanted you gone and would continue to make false accusations through Wells Fargo ethics line. The most enjoyable part of the job was the returning customers and the hard working co workers who helped support others."
bad,"Management changed every couple months, morale was low, and the culture was atrocious. Everyone was very fungible, and knew it. No support for professional growth, just implausible daily quotas that couldn't be met without seriously compromising ethics, quality, and compliance. Poor parking situation as well."
bad,"Wells Fargo publishes an updated Visions and Values book each year with the proposal that their Employees are their best assets, while developing a culture for the internal departments to destroy each other and ruin individuals.  "
bad,Just can't get it turned around.  Continuing to face challenges that years of poor management and poor treatment of associates matriculated.  Would not recommend.
bad,Many jobs were outsourced to India because of all the trouble that Wells Fargo got in a couple years ago.  But prior to announcing that they were down sizing it was a very in your face stressful job.  Very poor management.
bad,"This review is for WFS in Charlotte (Duke Center) As a Director within WFS, I saw firsthand how petty and clueless senior management was. Some of these people had been at Wells Fargo and its predecessor companies for pretty much all their careers - so they had no idea of how the world should work or does work. Most of the time was spent fighting with the other groups like Risk and Compliance. I noticed so many back handed ways of getting things done, I almost wondered if we were all NOT part of the same team. It surely felt like that all the time. It was an US vs THEM mentality. It could be Charlottes vs SF; Business vs. Compliance, Trade 1 vs Trader 2 etc. This behavior was not only tolerated but encouraged as those in the senior most seats also took part in it. Constant bullying to get things done; threatening with job loss. I myself was threatened with a poor performance review unless I kissed the ground my manager walked on (which I refused to do). Lot of politics and back room deals.  It got so bad, that I actually recorded my manager, on many occasions, threatening me, being belligerent to junior people from other groups. She is still working there......"
bad,"I was let go without cause and even when I requested several times the manager wouldn't talk to me. I felt like communication was null, and the manager did what he wanted not what was best for the organization."
bad,"Wells Fargo had lots of potential and at times did show some care for employees.  There were lots of options offered by the company for ability to participate in to continue to develop and grow, however all of any positive efforts were ruined by poor leadership executed at the local branch levels.  When efforts were made to make HR aware of issues, management retaliation occurred and made going to work each day dreadful.  If I ever had to take a sick day, or be home with a sick child (few and far between) I was given a guilt trip and made to feel bad for needing the time away.  I was also not able to participate in the new maternity program offered to new moms - missed it by 1 month, was not given an opportunity to take or a location for lactation purposes to pump for my newborn and stopped producing because of that.  "
bad,Company is not a good place to work overall. Always doing something shady  and cannot stay out of the news .  I almost hate having to put wells on my resume.
bad,"I worked during the ""scandal"" of when customer service was scored based on sales.  We had goals, were forced to sell, or our performance was rated as poor.  The manager I had played favorites, and if you weren't one of the favorites, you got harassed.  A new hire just out of training quit the second day on the floor because of the harassment.  Customer service has no tools to help customers, everything is decided by a program, and the managers can't override it, and even if they could, they didn't care enough to do it."
bad,i worked at Wells Fargo for approximately 7 months. I couldn't take it anymore. I felt like my entire life depended on making sure i sold at all costs. I hear it's getting much better in terms of pressure thanks to all the pending lawsuits.
bad,"This was probably one of the most horrible places I have ever worked. Management serves no purpose in giving constructive criticism or coaching you when they pull up to review your calls, they bash and try to discipline you rather than help you. You litterally have to walk on egg shells at this company. The work environment is very very stressful. If you have a family and your home life is of importance to you DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT work here. There is no balance the schedules are horrible, managements sucks, and it is a stressful environment. I felt a weight lifted off my shoulders when I left this place."
bad,Forced to perform unethical sales practices.  High stress sales environment with unreachable goals.  District Managers would make recommendations to increase sales that were not ethical.  If not followed they would take disciplinary action.
bad,I was wochovia and everything was ok. Once it become Wells Fargo the culture change a lot the main focus was sales and if you didn’t achieved your sales management will make you feel like you was going to get fired.
bad,"pay was decent but not for what all we went through. wells fargo put stress on us to force people into things they didn't need. mngmt sucked they were lazy and did not want to properly train. god forbid you have health issue such as a kidney stone, they will not work with you and retaliate with your scheduling"
bad,As a salary employee I am expected to work more than 55 hours a week. Take no lunch and provide quality work with limited resources.  Leadership is unappreciative and refuses to help advance careers.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"The Home Office in St. Louis, MO is filled with nepotism, favoritism and racism. For example, entire departments are 100% white (i.e. The Operations Analyst department.) The long-term employees are legacy from AG Edwards and most of them are very racist and only promote their friends. The company's recruiters will lie about the career advancement opportunities and then systematically make minorities stay in lower level roles. If you have a degree, NEVER accept a position in Operations, you will never be promoted out the business unit and you will be forced to report to people with less qualifications than you. I had an MBA and I reported to someone who went to veterinary tech school. They are constantly doing unethical things, that's why they've been in the news so much recently. If you absolutely need a job, work at Wells as a last resort but don't get comfortable."
bad,"If you don't mind being tricked into a customer service job only to find out months later that they force you to shove credit cards down peoples throats, then it was a fine job, 10 years ago. Maybe things have changed, I still bank with them and feel that my experience has gotten better after all of the law suits they went through. Although when I worked there I didn't force enough products on people and they wouldn't allow me time to actually have a personal connection with the customers. 3 minutes per customer is all I got, and i need more time than that. When I worked there they seemed like a cut throat evil banking industry and they treated their employees the same way. So if you like being evil, this job is for you!"
bad,Many day-to-day changes in roles/responsibilities with very little explanation or any time to adjust to the new environment. Very overwhelming workload with little direction.
bad,"Poor Training, poor management, micro management, inflated ego's"
bad,A company that created a negative culture by creating an environment in which nobody was accountable and putting into place incentives that drove poor operations.
bad,Wells Fargo does not appreciate their employees.  Top management did not respect their employees.  Employees were overworked and underpaid.  Sick time and vacation time was one in the same.
bad,My manager was horrible.  He asked me not to communicate with him.  He said that if I had a question I could as another employee and they could answer it.
bad,"A typical day was the team sitting around a large table and trying to test software with an awful lot of interruptions, schedule changes and release of a project that wasn't ready for prime time.  Our defects were downgraded or closed, our representatives voice wasn't heard and I don't feel good about how the project was managed.  I enjoyed my co-workers."
bad,Nothing but sales is all they wanted and customer service was not what they wanted. No enjoyment on personal banker role again nothing but trying to get everyone a product even if it didnt work for them
bad,After numerous Temp and Interim positions with Wells Fargo all I got was anxiety and unstable income. I will never work for that company again unless my life depends on it.
bad,Wells Fargo was not a good fit for me. It lacked the culture that I was accustomed to at AT&T. I felt as though I was merely a number. I had great relationships with my client base but did not find that to be the same within my office.
bad,"good place to work."
bad,"I believe I have made my point.  The contrast between the Wachovia world and that of Wells Fargo was like night and day.  WF cared nothing about their commercial customers--only about making money--since my departure they have been exposed for what they are.  Based upon the few people I have kept in touch with, nothing has changed in this department."
bad,"What was presented and what actually is are dramatically different. Being in their call center is not a good representation of the company. It is very long days which does not make for a proper balance of personal and professional life. While the culture is inclusive, there is minimal support from management and micromanaging of time."
bad,"Ugly, unfair and unspoken, hidden politics are everywhere in the organization and management will terminate you for no reason, or just because you say 1 thing wrong. Horribly uncaring culture and self-serving cut-throat attitudes make Wells Fargo 1 of the worst places to ever work."
bad,"Wells Fargo management have their own team within teams which means that those in the little circles get the good leads, the highly productive branches, and get help getting involved with affluent clients, those not part of their little circles have to swim or sink on their own."
bad,Employees are just a warm body to beat on unless you're management. They lie to the public and encourage employees to do the same. They've mastered the art of the cover up.
bad,"Worked a lot of hours for too long and could not balance my home life. Sales culture very strong and encouraged unethical sales practices. Poor management, managed through fear and intimidation."
bad,"The management does not lead by example and everyone is just trying to cover their butt.  A very depressing environment.  Many perks or benefits stated can change immediately.  Flexible work schedule, tuition reimbursement, and many other benefits people rely on can change with little notice leaving individuals worried about job stability."
bad,A great place to get experience in the financial industry if you have no experience.. good place to  meet people and network with new customers and business.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,I liked my co-workers.It was a decent place to work. Management definitely has their favorites and reward them with cherry picked leads. All in All it was decent
bad,"Horrific management, extreme micro-management from all levels.  Poor leadership and lots of finger-pointing.  Minimal guidance and direction and poor employee recognition.  I cannot recommend Wells Fargo as an employer to anyone.  Extreme favoritism for long term employees.  Poor culture and significant lack of integrity.  Organization is one of the worst organizations for which I have ever been employed."
bad,"Managers have their core group of favorites who enjoy time to chit-chat, basically more breaks than the rest of group.  Some favorites routinely violate the business casual dress code while managers say nothing to them.   The Favorites are put in positions to audit others in department so they can ""help"" their favorites and bully others....managers know but ignor.   Management wonders why morale is low and turnover is high."
bad,A dramatically changed organization w/highly practiced nepotism from employees and upper management that came from some of the worse financially failed mortgage teams in the melt down. These individuals never learned to do a loan compliantly. It’s the new Countrywide. A sweatshop to say the least and an organization too big to care about what’s really going on. What initially started as an exciting and engaging place has now turned to a horrible environment for anyone.
bad,Awful place to work. Management was horrible. Cut-throat. Unethical. Scammed customers and co-workers alike. Broke the law. They do not care about their employees. I was robbed and no one did anything
bad,Wells Fargo is trying to change the culture with all the negative press over the last several years.  They have been updating and reorganizing divisions.  The main problem is there are way to many barriers between the every do worker and management.  In my current potions there is no communication with management.  I am currently the only team member in my office with no support.  Very lost and poor communication and training for employees.
bad,I wouldn’t even tell my enemy to work for this company. They work you like a old punching bag. Criticizing is their number one tactic. High expectations with no compensation Worst job ever... would rather wait tables again then ever bank tell again... at least at Wells Fargo.
bad,"Productive based oriented, customer service varies with every leader you get, teams of leadership show favoritism, with a very diverse culture, ping pong tables in lunch room, TV/ sports areas, training for specific areas however the training varies from department to department.and there is options to work from home."
bad,not a good place to grow and develop...they did not do any training or career development. Management was not in the building most days so it seemed like everyone did whatever they wanted.
bad,Wells fargo training is great and you are even told if you are to get fired it will be because of time and attendance. Of course as a new employee that does not stick in your head as truth. As an employee management tells your to lie (adjust) your time card because they do not allow overtime. You make the changes over and over again. If they want to get rid of you management will fire you for falsifying your time cards.
bad,"While the banking Department Fargo is great to work for. The security department is extremely poor. Put together with good old boys mentality. With managers that just like to create forms for no reason, with no corporate approval. The uniform services department with Wells Fargo picks and chooses the rules in which they enforce for their Access Control. They will give you 18 hour days, with only a few hours notice while at work. And force you to work because no one else is available to take the position. Then they will review your performance every day on closed-circuit television. They are very poor about making your duties clear. There is absolutely no margin for learning or error. Pay is low for the armed position. The managment is very much do-as-i-say-not-as-i-do. Because they feel the rules do not effect them.  Reading this, if I was a stranger. I would think that this was an ex-employee with a grudge. But I spent over a year with Wells Fargo and saw exactly how their uniform services division works. It has all the flamboyance of a fly-by-night security company. Unfortunately it has the Wells Fargo name. If you decide to work for them good luck, you will really need it."
bad,"A typical day at work was very stressful, due to micro management. Managers were never available when you needed them. Tension was really bad across the floor, low morale on all teams. The hardest part of the job was coming in every day, wondering what was going to happen next, on the floor. The most enjoyable part was having the pleasure of meeting some wonderful people I worked with the five years I worked at the company, Which also made a transition to the new company I work for now."
bad,It's no wonder the scandals hit this place.  Crazy sales goals and terrible leadership.  Employees were pushed to force products on customers with no regard for what was in the customer's best interests.
bad,They required you to solicit out in the local area during down time which is illegal without a license to solicit. Not much I can say that was good about the work life. Managers were very competitive and aggressive with no regards to ethics. Worked long hours even overtime to ensure everyone met their goals for the day.
bad,"One of the worst places I’ve worked. I was doing just fine there, but the cattiness reached an all time high and it became a very hostile work environment. My service manager became aggressive and our female banker would constantly gossip behind my back with the service manager. It was a huge blow to my self esteem. I hated going in to work."
bad,"Stressful awful management with ridiculous goals and awful coaching and communications guidelines where micromanagement became the norm and cheating, duping and manipulating customers was encouraged. Don't buy into their ""We're sorry we'll do better"" BS they were and continue to be an awful work environment."
bad,"no work life balance, expectations are unrealistic. stressful environment. minimal, if any support from management or senior leaders.   doesn't pay for the work done."
bad,"I was a VP level at Wells Fargo and found that I was treated like a child."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"The environment is very poor. If you do not fall into the category that management feels, you are out-casted. HR does not support personnel unless your are in their group. RUN - do not walk away from Wells Fargo."
bad,"For the limited time I worked there, the emphasis was on selling not true customer service. The management had no concerns for the staff working conditions or hours"
bad,The work is controlled by other employees who assign the work out to everyone. When they stop assigning you work that means your next to be let go that's the excuse that use to get you out the door. (not opening enough accounts). Wells Fargo overall is a great place to work but management makes it horrible.
bad,"Was a a Mananger, but was unable to discipline those that were using questionable account opening.  High pressure sales culture with unreasonable goals forced people to act umetically or lose their jobs"
bad,Wells Fargo proved to be an abusive and manipulative work environment.  Wells Fargo is behind the curve for customer service in comparison to similar companies.  Wells Fargo does not monitor upper management closely enough to keep lower management and non-management staff safe or secure in work environment.
bad,Like watching a painfully slow train crash as management pretended that fraud and lies were not the most important part of propping up a mortgage side of the business that was giving away money with no realistic expectation that they would ever get paid back.
bad,"Way too many meetings and useless training classes, management is not promoted from within existing employees. Ina a daily routine, you must include wasted time with team meetings that have nothing to do with closing loans."
bad,Worst company to work for. I was robbed while working for this company and was treated like dirt. No career advancement. Good ole boy system. Wish I knew who to turn to while I was employed their. I would love to sue them!!!
bad,Management wasn't really around too often to help with any issues. No real offers of promotion or advancement from within. No real culture within the office as you always needed to be at your desk working and taking incoming calls.
bad,"Fiefdoms, factionalization, sabotage, and infighting make this workplace far more stressful and far less productive than it should be."
bad,"I worked there for fifteen years, I was passed by for promotion, was treated unfairly.  After being promised that our work location would not be affected by the newly acquired financial institution back in 2012, we were the first department to be outsourced and let go.  I would not recommend this organization as a good place to work for anyone."
bad,"As a phone banker we were forced to meet a ""sales goal"" and recommend products to customers even knowing that they could not afford it. We saw their account. We know as bankers that this is NOT what was best for the customer but we HAD to make a sale. Wells Fargo did not care about the person who's money they held. I left as soon as I found a better career from which I have not looked back from. The job lacks creativity and structure. And my boss was terrible and knew nothing."
bad,"It was awful. One day they're patting you on the back for your hard work, the next day they are threatening your job. Everything was very inconsistent working there. They cared more about sales then they did their customers."
bad,I have no other comment than it is not a stable place to work. with constant hiring and then laying off. There is no coordiantion between management and in certain roles you may treated as a child.
bad,Top performers are awarded/promoted even if they accomplished those numbers doing unethical things. Employees that do things the correct way are not rewarded.
bad,"Don’t fall for them promising becoming FTE, this will never happen. "
bad,"This company does not value their employees or the work they do. There is no sense of culture and I don't feel like they celebrate diversity. The only reason I stayed for as long as I did was because I had a nice manager, that's it. This job gave me heart palpitations."
bad,"Was not my cup of tea--felt physically ill at the location, every one was so rude (customers, employees, management). It was such a horrible place to work. Don't do it. Even if you get hired, the chances of being successful and happy in your location are almost non-existent."
bad,Wells Fargo at that time had many of its own issues which seemed to trickle down to management which seemed to trickle down to employees. Advancement wasn't a priority in the phone bank because the turn over at the time was as high as 95%.
bad,"A typical day at Wells Fargo I arrived to work at 9:30am my shift started at 10am. I would clock in to let my mangers know I'm here and start my day. Which consist of meetings, and depending on what of the week food trucks and town halls."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Call Center Sweat Shop - with power hungry managers who kiss butt up the organizational chart and and micro manage the employees.  Minimal diversity - The absolute worse job I ever had.
bad,It was stressful everyday. It was nonstop work. The pay wasn’t even worth it. The management there was horrible. It was no teamwork. No one helps you.
bad,"This is a cold barren place to work. As it was put it to me, first come the stockholders, then the customers , then management and then a distant fourth is the worker."
bad,"A typical day at work would include customer interactions,surveys,and multiple reviews. Days were typically longer and would include extended hours. Often there would be internal meetings or customer grievances that needed to be addressed."
bad,"I should have sued and still thinking I should!  The management and company should be shut down.  Most of them got karma but the rest his yet to come.  I am still thinking about exposing their inside craziness.  The world needs to know what kind of bank they are dealing with, and the type of people they have in position to so call manage people."
bad,Wells Fargo needs to work on taking better care of their employees . More focused on getting sales and building the book of business verses building a great environment for the workers
bad,"They shipped more jobs over to Philippines, and had us working 10 hours days plus Saturdays. All Doctor, and kids activities had to be cancelled due to the overtime. If you called in sick you had to make up the 2 hours of OT up. There is no notice when the OT would begin or end. I would not recommend this company due to more jobs are going to be outsourced to other countries."
bad,"horrible job, poor management. no pay no help. this is not a long term job you have to do what you can and get out. the company is very selfish and doesn't care"
bad,Wells Fargo was a horrible place to work. Employees were forced to sell products that many customers did not need or understand. No chance for job advancement and their lack of skill in hiring a decent manager was overwhelming.
bad,As an employee who has not only met metrics but surpassed them every day/week/month/ year guess how much my annual raise was? 0.10 cents! Thank you Wells Fargo for motivating me to find a better company who will acknowledge me and pay me a living wage. Living in the Bay Area on what you pay is impossible! CEO can get millions in a raise but his employees are struggling to stay afloat.
bad,"Terrible to work for.  I will not mention my DMs name, but she was just a horrible person to work for.  The constant threats of losing your job and call nights.  There was no family balance"
bad,force products down customers throats and constant threat of being fired if you didn't do so . . . i worked pre-scandal and it was the worst place i've ever worked at
bad,Working for Wells Fargo was very stressful and child like at times.  Either you were a part of the team or you weren't.  Gossiping and bad mouthing others was rampant.
bad,"Management usually did not know anything about the work we were doing. Training was non-existent even though the work involved large loan amounts, We had paid days off but you could hardly ever use them."
bad,Way to stressful and you had to work at least one day on the weekends every week you never got two days off together. They push you to keep the amount of time on the phone to 3 mins and also you have to push a product on every customer.
bad,"This is a company that has attracted a great deal of talented and committed employees. The culture drives employees extremely hard, burns them out and then simply replaces them. Success is identified simply as return to stockholder. This is not uncommon nor out of place the means however are at the expense of customers and of employees."
bad,"This was a very high pressure, high stress job. It teaches you patients but that is about it. Managers dont care about you unless you are meeting all metrics."
bad,Wells Fargo has poor management selection. There are many internal unethical activities done by managers. Discrimination and unfair work environment..
bad,"This is a company where you can be successful if you are a favorite of the managers. Otherwise you get no support, leads are given to only a few people, internal processes are completely broken and slow moving. Very hard to keep promises of any kind to clients."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Management pre-selects who they want in a position. I have personally applied for about 50 positions and have had three interviews, all within the same department."
bad,"I've worked for Wells Fargo on four contracts. The first was outstanding; the manager was great, the team was great, and the work was challenging and satisfying. From the second contract forward, it went downhill. Things started getting more cutthroat and the management changed in the middle of projects. Communication was severely lacking. I won't work for them again."
bad,Not a fun place to be. Everyone is at each others throat and management is a joke. All referral partners wont send any new deals because getting them closed on time or even closed at all rarely happens.
bad,"I hated this job more than any other job I have worked at in my life. Overworked, and you have to donate them and arm and a leg to have a lunch break long enough to attend a doctor appt. I was vomiting blood one morning and the manager still told me that I have no option but to come in because they were short staffed. I had a job shadow scheduled 3x with a department I wanted to work in that my managers would always cancel on me because they ""didn't have enough staff"" to let me have the day to job shadow. They work you crazy hours but then freak out when you have no work/life balance. It's kind of unbelievable. Go somewhere where your hard work will be appreciated!!"
bad,Run as fast as you can. This company clearly has issues with compliance that it’s sad. Employees were told to work on weekends on a Friday at other locations without sufficient notice (the day before). Managers are not properly trained as reflected by the way they speak to employees in the branches. It felt like being in a school.
bad,"Look at their 10K filings, they are announcing several waves of layoffs...good luck on surviving the politics.  The company is announcing profits quarter over quarter, but internally it is in shambles under their own bureaucracy,"
bad,"I took a job paying less when I left Wells.  Since the scandal that happen, the place is just not worth it.  They under pay even when you are in the company and trying to move up and when you have degrees.  It's like high school and it is not a good work life balance."
bad,"It is a shame one of the largest banks needs to treat both its employees and customers as expendable pieces of garbage. Goals are achieved by the unethical and fraudulent. This is not an exception, it is the culture."
bad,Applied a lot of qa analyst jobs here which met my qualification easily but never get any call from recruiter or HR of wells. As I heard manager or leads in wells always hire internally and job posting is just formality to show...i believe it's true.
bad,"quick to hire, very quick to fire. Trains very well, hopefully you are placed at a good branch with good staff otherwise the job is not good, micro manages"
bad,"Management will ask you to bend rules and regulations to meet numbers and when you refuse they don’t assist you in anyway towards advancing your career, or when management assistance is necessary."
bad,unrealistic expectations. management too busy making themselves look good to be in touch with the real world. company loves to ramp up and then lay off workers
bad,"No such thing as truth and lending at Wells Fargo. Just take a minute to google all of the trouble they are currently in for cheating customers out of hundreds of millions of dollars, and somehow no one is in jail..."
bad,I am and always will be grateful for the job and paycheck the company provided me. It helped me provide for my family and that is what is important. I wanted a career though and Wells Fargo could not provide me what a career I wanted to proceed with.
bad,"From my personal experience, if a manager personally doesn't like you or have any type of jealousy towards you,  they WILL find a way to get you fired. They will come up with lies that make it impossible to explain or defend yourself with the ""internal investigators"" (who are also @$$h0les and always side with management). Morale at Wells Fargo does not exist. They screwed me out of getting unemployment due to their lies, and have no remorse for their behavior. No work/life balance if you don't have kids. I've also canceled my bank account with them. I want nothing to do with Wells Fargo."
bad,"management would come in drunk and trying to cover it up by eating pickles. wells fargo was always more concerned about getting more referral and more money for themselves, than the customer. ill never go back, i only refer people who like the goal crazed environment."
bad,"At this company, customer service was a joke. I am not a sales person, so I thought. But even as a teller you are required to make sales while trying to service a customer. The company does not care how busy or slow your branch is, the goal is still the same...SALE, even if it is not in the best interest of the customer."
bad,What ever you do here will never be enough for their monstrous sales goals.  They dont care about anything but money.The only good thing was the health insurance.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"political and slow. Many people I work with seem to have lots of egos, making it difficult to reach agreements and solve problems creatively. Not a great place to work."
bad,"There were a handful of really good, genuine, and fun people who loved helping others take control of their financial futures.  This included my immediate manager."
bad,"I have not enjoyed a single day in this organization, though this is one of the largest bankers in the world.  No policy or procedure for running the daily activities; it only comes out to save the back, when fire is obvious."
bad,"Doesn't matter your position, all they care about is getting the most products out of each customer. They're changing what they call ""sales goals"" but they're still all about product pushing. With the negative media attention they started a Culture of Caring Campaign but by the time the message gets watered down from the top it's really just a tick mark for managers to say they had talks with us about it and handed out materials. Often we lack the most updated information in the branches because it's not always disseminated to all team members. Think: several unopened boxes in your managers office for months. Of the 4 branches I worked at in different roles none of them did things by the book and stressed out when it came time to get audited."
bad,"Taking care of customers every day needs was amazing and growing the relationships with your customers and building trust. The sales, not so good. Very competitive and unfair with sales goals. Seems like they cared more about sales then the customers."
bad,The benefits are the only reason I have stayed so long. They do work well with other schedules. The sales practices are still unethical in my opinion.
bad,In my opinion Wells Fargo is not fair and is not honest to their customers.  Employee morale was down as Wells cut bonuses and compensation packages were done away with. In regards to cross selling employees were asked to lie to customers several times which I would not do and that became a problem.
bad,"employed as a temp.  No team players.  Work ethics and moral is very low."
bad,"Not much to say about wells fargo. Had a decent work space, had your own personal area and could customize it. Most of the managers were good to work with."
bad,"Sales, Sales, Sales was what I remember.  Managers often had to go through multiple sales meetings daily. Often times, managers would relay the information that was provided to them down to the Personal Bankers."
bad,great paying job but not great consistent management and not considerate of there employees. they expect professionalism when they don't portray that.
bad,Unorganized. management is horrible. all about sales & not the customer itself . no job security. fraud with sales. management doesn't care about what happens with family.
bad,"Most unfair Company with horrible Management.  The annual survey was a joke.  If your Manager didn't get a great score,all the employees would have to attend these meetings to help them increase their score."
bad,"Wells fargo management didn't care about their customers or their employees, all that they care about is getting business. Anyone with a name can get an account there."
bad,"I went to this with a one-year contract to hire, and due to company reorganization then the contract will end after only 6-months. This has caused management turmoil in the corporate finance division that I work in. Disappointing and not what I expected."
bad,Managers do not always hold the degrees needed for the level of management they hold. Many managers are given positions based on years with the company verses skills.
bad,This company has its good and bad but overall you will find yourself stuck in the same place for years. If they do advance your career sky is the limit.
bad,"The worst job I ever had. I was a HMC. and promised the world when I came over from my much higher paying brokerage. You cannot get deals done here even with a high credit score, plenty of reserves, and live below your means. I have never created so many enemies as I did with my clients at this bank...Horrible."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Very male dominated work environment. Human Resources manager was rude and chose people based on favoritism. Avoid Avoid Avoid Avoid Avoid Avoid if you can.
bad,"A typical day at work included managing bank store operations as well as managing and training employees and coaching a successful team in sales and service. I learned to coach employees through the four stages of learning and development and was able to step back and allow them to thrive independently in sales and service. As a result, I witnessed the promotion of existing staff and hired new employees.The hardest part of the job was working to produce positive changes in a negatively charged workplace where company demands in sales and service as well as human resource practices produced a hostile environment. I solved operational problems, strengthened sales and service, and developed team unity and trust to the ultimate success of my employees and associates and to the satisfaction of our customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was coaching and associating with my coworkers."
bad,Wells was a good place to work when I first started but the Managment needs work.  Wellsfargo started off as a really good company when I first started.
bad,"The only people WF hates more than its' customers, are its' employees.  There is no room for advancement.  No legitimate training is offered, or allowed. The Internal Ethics committee will report all issues brought up to discipline anyone reporting ethical issues.  See Congressional hearings for more details and references."
bad,"Job details included reviewing loan documents and entering the information into Wells-Fargo's loan pricing system.  Low pay with the temporary agency taking a large portion of your total pay.  There are many days where there is approximately 1-2 hours of work to do in the morning where they give you nothing to do for the rest of the day, so you have to sit at your desk waiting for more work, where little to none appears.  Since there is no work to manage the managers spend most of their time micromanaging the workers with nothing to do and offering nothing to do."
bad,Wells Fargo is a very corrupt place to work at.  They are constantly pushing the employees to sale even if it does not apply to the customer. The managers are disrespectful and not understanding.
bad,management sucks and work is not easy meeting goals. your job is never secure if you not meeting sales goals by far the worst place to work. they want to much without paying you for the job
bad,Be prepared to work hard and long hours. You have to be a self driven person to move up within the company. It has been an adventure and has helped me develop into a mature worker. Has been there through my kids births with the benefits and pay.
bad,"Management does not have your back, except maybe to whip you into unrealistic sales goals. Worst banking job I ever had. Was estatic to leave and would never return."
bad,"Being encouraged to be deceitful and misleading at any cost in order to achieve a sale.  Terrible management, you're best will never be enough, birthdays, holidays, special events, and family time come 2nd place to SALES SALES SALES"
bad,I do not wish to discuss my personal feelings about Wells Fargo via internet. I will discuss my views on the company as a whole and my work experience when necessary.
bad,"I work in the cash vault and when I say work, I mean I live there. First shift is working 45 hrs or more a week while 2nd shift gets to go home early. No communication between management and employees. Each Manager has a different definition of team work. Work directors yell at you in front of other team members about private matters instead of pulling you aside and being professional."
bad,There is no growth. You can  be promoted and be there forever. I am unhappy how managers can get away with certain acts. It is baffling. To work for the same company and the rules change everywhere. They aren't consistent
bad,"Sales, Sales, Sales. Nothing more than that. The upper management doesn't care about you, they only care about your numbers and you will always just be a number. Terrible place to work."
bad,"Sorry my review is more jaded due to personal reasons at the place."
bad,"Confusing direction, poor tools, little rewards. As an exempt employee I work consistently more than 50 hours a week with no comp time. Doing 3 different jobs"
bad,I worked for this company and gave 110% to get harassed by my district manager. When I finally turned him in I got fired and he kept his job. Please use caution when applying here
bad,Solution quotas that are unrealistic. Does not care about helping the customer and the most important thing is making a sale. Employees are looked at as replaceable tools.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Could be better. They treat employees horrible  you have to kiss up to upper management to get anywhere and they dont look at quality just who kisses butt more
bad,"Poor management.....when you are salaried they take away your holidays by working you 40+ hours not counting the holiday.  I never got paid for a holiday.  The culture of caring is sell, sell, sell, or you will be on the list and radar.  There is NO work like balance with this company.  No respect of customers on the side of management because of the unethical way they push for sales.  I worked many years through many banks and Wells Fargo is the worst I've ever worked for.  It's the same upper management that came with the other banks and nothing has changed, just the name and their push for sales.  Even the tellers are on the hot seat to sell.  They have so much responsibilities as it is and they are forced to recommend seeing a banker for further products.  If they don't put it in the system correctly, they don't get credit for their hard work.  It's  been awful watching my team stressed out over referrals.  They lose sight of the focus on balancing, operational issues and it is in humane the way the tellers are treated.  No respect, no decent pay for what they do and everyone is just a number.  Numbers, numbers, numbers......then they changed it to behaviors and activities.  Which equates to numbers, numbers, numbers.  Forgive me for being so critical  but this is so true and anyone who thinks they have job security that's been there more then 25 years, you better think twice.  They like to get rid of tenured people because of the accrued PTO and there so called - Pay?????  I will never recommend anyone to work there or bank there."
bad,"Too much about sales, not much about the clients. You come to work and you are expected to open accounts for people that do not need it."
bad,This company has astronomical goal expectations and a very high turn over rate. It is very easy to loose your job unless you find a way to keep changing roles.
bad,"thy never tell you what is going on and expect you to just know things magically.  They are very manipulative.  You will end up being around a lot of weird people I guarantee that.  They will just tell you things at the last second and suddenly you have to pick up the slack.  I did work in a very isolated place, not retail, but that is my impression of them...  Very very very strange, I would say what they say and what they do are two very different things.  "
bad,"Open/close/maintain accounts, open IRA's, Notarize docs."
bad,My experience at wf was not a good one at all very  dysfunctional and many people in the company are unhappy and holding on to their jobs by a thread due to high sales demands and poor customer service. Very insecure work place.
bad,"Probably the worst job I've ever had. Management is terrible. They do not value you as an employee, they treat everyone like they are disposable. Their only focus is reaching sales goals. A manager is breathing down your neck daily about sales goals. Our location was under staffed for over a year and instead of hiring new employees they forced everyone to work overtime with no days off. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. very stressful and poorly managed."
bad,"just awful work culture, sell sell sell, force force force, customers seen as products or solutions"
bad,I was laid off after 6 years. Several departments were transferred to other locations and was not able to relocate. Working there never felt very secure.
bad,"Employees are a very competent and fun group of people. The day mostly encompasses receiving inbound phone calls; there is minimal ""supervision"" related to handling of accounts and dealing with customers. The potential for advancement is very minimal even with an advanced degree. The politics tend to prevent advancement and practical change. Management is more concerned with numbers than people."
bad,"I banked with Wells Fargo for 17 years before I started working there and now that I know how they operate I will be discontinuing my accounts. I was instructed only to answer questions that I was directly asked even if I had more information that could prevent future issues just to keep my handle time low. Then I was required to offer every caller a product even if it was not in the customers best interest. I really wanted to help people obtain financial security but every level of management is purely numbers, sales, and time driven."
bad,welcoming clients open and closing accounts providing great customer service and sales to the clients placing clients in the best possible product for there needs. I learned that building repor with  clients is the best way to build trust and respect. Management was okay nothing much to say. Some coworkers were great to work with. The hardest part was leaving my clients My clients made my day enjoyable.
bad,Very Political environement and not interested in develpment of people. It's a good place to start and the money is good but do not plan to stay.
bad,"I hate this place so much I can't put it into words. You're forced to jam banking products down peoples throats even when the product isn't right for them. Constant cold calling, visiting business to sell accounts while they attempted to conduct their own business, and more awfulness. Run...run from this job. The money is a joke for all the stress they put on you to sell."
bad,"To make a long story short and to save your nerves I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone. The management promises you a fast promotion while keeping you at one spot for years. Even if you have potential and skills, you will NEVER move up the corporate ladder without having a strong interest of managers to get you there. Bottom line, avoid this company unless you want a roller coaster ride for your precious nerves."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"The corporate culture at Wells Fargo extends from the customer interaction to the employee. There is no reasoning behind many decisions, your success is contingent on your affiliations and there is absolutely no explanation by Wells Fargo for lack of choices regarding life/work balance."
bad,This is a 100% commission position which lacks job security and career advancement.  I am starting a family and need job stability which is not evident here.
bad,All you do is beg customers to get products they dont need. And try to make outrages sales goals. Hated it. Bebefits couldve been better
bad,"Horrible experience! Management goes into your cash register when told not to by district manager. While in interaction with customer they go in and take money if they don't have time to go to vault and tell you later what they took. If busy they ""help"" you by going in cash register and getting the money you need and gives it to the customer. They are not allowed to be near your cash unless you are unbalanced. If short you get fired and not them even though they were in your register. They stand behind you and write everything you say to customer and make you sell things they don't need. ""Commission"" HAHA $1 per sale IF you make your goal. NOT WORTH THE STRESS"
bad,"No work/life balance. Unattainable goals. Management does not care about you. Call nights 5-6 times a week. This company has too many cliques and the only way to get into management is by being unethical. You are told to switch customer's accounts who currently have no monthly service fee and explain the ""benefits"" to them but there are NONE."
bad,"While employed with Wells Fargo, I witnessed and was subjected to overt discrimination by Management on multiple occasions.  This is not a Company I would ever recommend."
bad,"This company bought Wachovia Securities who had bought A.G. Edwards and sons. They have made a mess out of organizing and made horrific mistakes while trying to figure out how to manage the Securities Industry side of banking."
bad,"Horrible and demeaning team lead and supervisors. Anytime someone on the team would need assistance with a customer, team lead would roll his eyes and act as if we were all stupid and bothering him. There was absolute no praise for any good work. All focus is on what you can do better. When the issue was addressed with management regarding the team lead, we were basically told that they were over staffed and that that we would have to deal with it or resign. Do not apply!"
bad,"Horrible company to work for. They do not treat their employees or customers well. They have very sneaky and manipulative sales tactics and if you do not meet your quota you are constantly told you are not working hard enough. Wells Fargo is a billion dollar company owning more than 50% of America's mortgages. They have too much capital to fail, hence the need to push credit more than any other product or service they have. Wells Fargo is a ""solution"" based company, they are 100% sales driven and do not care about small business. Wells Fargo is also very scripted when dealing with their customers and finding out what their ""financial needs"" are. I have seen on multiple occasions where employees are belittled, berated, and bullied by the big managers if they are not working to this standard."
bad,If you like being micromanaged in an environment where you are encouraged to hit sales numbers regardless of whether or not it is in the best interest of the customer you will love this place.
bad,"On average you would want to schedule 8-10 confirmed appointments a day to be successful along with all the traffic that comes in. On a daily basis I would do everything from issuing a customer a debit card to processing equipment financing and home equity applications and see them from start to finish. Along with that I did everything and anything in between. While in this role and with this company I learned how to ask the right questions so that I understood the individuals current financial state to recommend products and services that would help them to achieve their financial goals. It is a very aggressive environment that is not for everyone. While I was their unfortunately I seen extremely high turnover which in return gave me the opportunity to meet several great people during my time there.The hardest part of the job is learning how to master a permission to profile statement and conduct a meaningful customer needs assessment. A lot of people struggled with this and weren't able to attain the metrics that they were being asked to meet. The most enjoyable part of my job are my customers, coworkers, and all the great relationships I establish on a daily basis."
bad,lots of pressure to sell things to customers.  Did not like that feeling of someone watching over my shoulder during every transaction.
bad,There is a lot of micro management. No motivation. Its all about numbers and not about customer service. People are promoted by making the numbers with no management or people skills.
bad,"You are going to hate this company. I have been with them for 3 years and I am willing to start over from scratch if it means getting out of this place. Unrealistic goals, greedy employer, and just no respect for it's staff as a whole."
bad,"Let me start off by saying that this review is for Wells Fargo Advisors, not Wells Fargo Bank.  The Advisors group deliberately requires its employees to put the interests of the firm ahead of their clients.  I was a senior investment analyst when I joined the training program and after seeing the products they expected us to sell clients became physically ill.  The company pushes variable annuities and internally created products that consistently underperform the S&P then require advisors to sell these products in order to make sales hurdles.  When I pointed out my concerns and asked if I would be able to build a business slowly selling stocks and bonds, compliance began coming down on me for issues they did not understand.  Eventually I had to quit.  If you are an ethical professional or trying to build a business from scratch with out the shelter of an existing team, do not apply here.  You will not make it through your second year and the bank will be left holding the assets you brought in."
bad,The most difficult part of the job is the sales pressure every day.
bad,"Very busy all day,great customers.We had a awesome Management  Team."
bad,"reviewed conditions on previous loans underwritten, underwrote new loans by review assets, appraisal/collateral, 4506t, tax transcripts, calculate income, reviewed tax returns, respond to emails from processors and managers and updated loan amount when deemed necessary.I learned numerous things on a daily basis. Management frequently provided useful tools to help with day to day job functions. My co-workers were great to work with and was accessible the majority of the time. The hardest or the most challenging part of the job is keeping up with the email requests and staying with a 2 hours window of meeting the requests.  Being a Traveling Underwriter was the most enjoyable part of the job and working for an Awesome manager"
bad,This company has terrible benefits and terrible pay. the atmposphere is not fun but more boring. the managment does not care for their employees and looks at you as replaceable.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Loved helping customers and other team members. "
bad,"I felt that the staff was not up to par, and the management was verbally abusive and not professional. Being told that I can only use the restroom one to two times a workday while my manager is allowed a 5 minute smoke break every hour is not acceptable to me."
bad,This company practices nepotism in the extreme and if you mess with Daddy's little boy you will be terminated.
bad,I believe they are unfair and management has no rhyme or reason on why they do what they do. No consistency. I see why the turn over is extremely high.
bad,"At Wells Fargo if you don't hit your sales goals you are gone, no matter how good you are at being a teller.  Wells Fargo bought the small bank I was working at. The only thing good that came out of the merger was that I didn't have to wear my uniform anymore.  I almost made it a year, but could not take management or the pressure anymore."
bad,"After several years of managing and working in good and toxic work situations, WFHM is by far the worst.  As a manager, I was forced to manage by fear.  I was forced to terminate more employees in my 5 years at WF than all my 15 yrs combined elsewhere.  They create compensation plans that drive unethical behavior, then senior management looks the other way when results are achieved.  Good people are punished because they refuse to participate in such behavior, and some criminals are called ""top producers"".  In a couple year period, almost half the retail mortgage managers in my state were fired due to shady behavior.  Although, you will never get that story from the current managers.  Some had to take a dive and some of the remaining managers are the worst.  They never promote the most qualified - it's always the bosses best buddy.  There was one manager hired who had zero mortgage experience, minimal transferable skills, but boy she sure was a little cutie.  She lasted 8 months.  I worked there for 6 months before I had my first phone call with my boss.  Her words to me when I was hired were, ""I don't have time to babysit you, figure it out.  Don't call me.""  I loved the people that worked for me and did my best to leverage my network to help them secure employment elsewhere.  If you are considering employment at WFHM, don't trust anyone, including your manager, be prepared to work long hours, don't let the negative attitudes drag you down and don't get sucked into unethical behavior.  The money is not worth your integrity, or your career."
bad,while working at wells I was moved around branches and was being told a promotion was in the future after being transferred the management team decided to pick on me and tell me I shouldn't work there. the biggest issue with wells fargo is the managers nothing else its all the higher ups that think they can control the little people by bullying them. my experience at wells was not the best at first I was dedicated hard working and I would have done about anything for my job but after a while of working there I uncovered how much of a snake all the managers can be. they aren't worried about the customers they are only worried about the big bonus that comes at the end of each quarter and will do anything to get it. no one in the banking industry is completely honest at least not at wells fargo. we are told gaming is grounds for termination but everyone I knew did it even our manager didn't care how our goals were met. I strived to be the best with honesty my manager cheated his way to the top. its all about knowing people and lying your face off
bad,Working for Wells Fargo will go against a person's ethics and morals.
bad,"Wells Fargo is a bad business with a poorly written code of conduct, and with an operation so focused on financial gains that the ultimate goal for years was centered in profits and ripping off customers than in actually working on improving the business, acting wisely about business decisions, and in elevating the employees at the bottom to a place where they actually feel like they are a part of the decision making process."
bad,"A typical day includes taking calls up to 86 on average."
bad,"Everyone that has worked at wells fargo knows their sales culture. They create unrealistic goals and push employees to achieve. The result is that employee are depressed, stressed and forced to do shady and unethical things to hit their sales numbers. Every single employee that has worked at wells longer than a year has open a fake account and give a customer something they didn't need in order to stay employed."
bad,"As a CSSR (customer service and sales representative) I was expected to handle both the expectations of a teller and a banker. The pay is less than a regular Personal Banker, but the expectations are about the same (if not more). A CSSR is required to memorize two sets of scripting to regurgitate them word for word to every customer regardless of personal relationships. One set for tellers to sell customers unnecessary products and get them to sit with a banker (yes, tellers have sales goals they must hit also or they are terminated). The second set of scripting is the bankers scripting to try and ""add value"" to a customers visit. Really it's just jargon to try and justify them sitting with a banker so he/she can try and talk you into as many products as possible (regardless of need) and brainwash the customer into giving all 5's in case gallop calls to ask your customer how your service was the previous day. EXAMPLE: The scripting says things like ""To make sure that I do things right for you the first time, you wanted XY and Z?"" and, ""In order to go out of my way to please you today, I've done XY and Z"" and three others I won't bore you with. Then if gallop calls the next day in regards to your service, they ask the same questions like ""on a scale of 1-5, how well do you feel that your banker went out of their way to please you?"" Wells Fargo's scripting is directly related to brainwashing their customers to give great scores so they can boast of their EXCEPTIONAL service."
bad,I currently work for Wells Fargo  That is why I seek employment else where.
bad,I had an awful experience working with this company. Management was abusive and continued abusive behaviors after merge with Wells Fargo. Goals are unobtainable and managers lead by bullying.
bad,"I worked for this company for several years and it was awful. There was no work/life balance and employees are treated horribly. Selling is huge and most of the time employees are forced to sell products and services to hit high sales goals, not because it benefits the client."
bad,"There was nothing enjoyable about this job."
bad,Horrible place to work.Absolutely no respect to employees.Worked for his company 5 years and in 2009 give them my resignation letter.Now is Wells Fargo and even worst.
bad,"I was referred to this company by old friend of mine which i was told its a good company to work for. That all changed after a month later, too much micro managing and when if i needed any help, i was told to call banker connection hotline everytime which makes me believe that the management doesn't want to help or don't know anything. Other thing i dont like about this company is aggressive sales tactics how we have to harass customers over the phone and in branch to make them open accounts and other products which they dont need at all, only reason this sales tactics are used so management can get paid bigger incentives by just sitting around doing nothing. Oh yea i totally forgot to add this non management incentives is a complete joke and work schedule is not great because one week i work monday to saturday non stop and second week monday to friday from 8:30 am to 6 so pretty much its slavery. it doesn't matter how well of great job you do yesterday the next day management want you to sell the same. This job is nothing but stress sack even thu the pay is good but its not worth being worried about how i am going to make my goals and losing sleep due to extreme amount of stress because if i don't harass people and force them to open accounts then i will be terminated from work. This is one company i would never recommend to anyone specially for me i will never ever go back to wells fargo."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,most days senior management leads from the back - pushing people to identify solutions for the company which more than less is a win for the company and a loose for the customer and employee
bad,"One of the worst places I have ever worked in. Management is clueless and favoritism is rampant. The prime motivator is fear. Wells Fargo incentive plan is work hard, don't ask any questions or be fired. Too many meetings every week were a major time killer. Co-workers would not hesitate to stab you in the back to look good or keep their jobs. The best thing I can say about Wells Fargo is that I no longer work there. I'm still trying to pull the knife out of my back."
bad,"Overallthe company is a great place to work for if you have intense sales experience. Be prepared to give up your social life as for many nights you will be working late if goals are not met! If being micro managed is for you, then wells fargo is the place to work."
bad,"Low pay, unrealistic sales goals, crooked management. They use and abuse you, without ever saying thank you. Very hard to grow your career, all the management cares about is sales goals and their own rear end, organizational culture is only on paper. Would not recommend retail part of the bank to anyone!!!"
bad,"wellsfargo is a sell everything and the kitchen sink type of bank. get people in and out. alot of bankers on the floor. so, fighting for accounts is the norm. only the top producers get to leave earlier and get paid for 8hours of work. its a numbers game. but high turn over also. oh, and staying late to do telemarking calls is everyday. so, if you have kids. do yourself a favor and all the stress, and look at another bank"
bad,"Wells Fargo is very sales oriented. Employees are told to provide customers with everything they need but not one thing more. This is lip service. Once employed, employees can look forward to incredible pressure from management to increase sales. Any decrease in sales numbers will result in threats of loss of job. This is a daily occurrence for most employees. Lack of customers in the bank is not an excuse. Employees are told to go out there and make it happen."
bad,My manager heavily pushed me to meet sales goals that were extremely challenging and in my opinion impossible to meet. I was fired 6 months after a warning and two weeks received news that Wells Fargo was being sued for Bankers opening unwanted accounts to meet sales goals.
bad,This was probably the biggest mistake I’ve ever done. The work load was repetitive and you never got a sense of actual “helping.” People make the same mistakes day in and day out and you’re the one that has to clean up the mess. Metrics are based loosely around parameters you have little to no control over and management comes down hard on them. I rated 2 stars for advancement because I’ve heard of people being promoted but I’ve never actually seen it. The atmosphere was dreadful. People wanting to leave or be anywhere else than there but they were stuck. I wouldn’t take this job even if my life depended on it.
bad,"Didn't work there long enough to comment."
bad,It is difficult to progress in this company because there is no clear concise guidelines in regulation and how to use them in each situation. Management has not taken accountability for systems errors and push too much in their agents to make decisions that are not fair nor clear to how it should be a total standard all across the board
bad,Dont work there unless you are contracted in. They are slowly getting rid of the Vets and bringing in young contractors for half of the pay. Promotions are prioritized by who you know. HR does not do a good job along with managers about keeping your personal life private. HIPPA Laws are definitely not enforced.
bad,"training isnt uniform staff is very messy,management doesnt know the job but  pretends to and has their leads doing everything to hide the fact they don't."
bad,"As I went through tough family times, I did not feel my supervisor or employer understood or cared.  Instead, I was tossed to the wast side and 3 persons half my age were hired."
bad,"Everyone I know who has worked here for more than a year has hated it, ay least on the banking side; the FA side may be different. The turn over rate is high and stress is horrible."
bad,"Wells Fargo is a terrible company to work for with a toxic work culture. I worked there right before they got in trouble for opening fake accounts. They actively encouraged shady behavior when making sales, but then fired people when they got caught for that same behavior. It was a terrible place to work and even after they got caught, my former colleagues said it hasn't changed at all."
bad,"This was one of the worst jobs ever. Definitely not a company who stand behind protecting their team members. Be prepared to be sexually harassed by management and for nothing to be done but have your case closed and sweep under a rug and still have to work everyday with this manager. The people in higher positions don’t care about you, they only worry about Numbers!! Wasn’t a safe comfortable work place"
bad,"the workplace culture was not the best because all they care about is to teach you to sell and they really don't care about their employees, but yet you are supposed to care for your customer when the company doesn't even care about you. Co-workers are not friendly because of the type of environment and management that we had to deal with."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,The hardest part of the job is getting micromanaged by your manager. I learned that if you are great at your job and not a kiss (fill in the blank) then you will not last.
bad,I did not enjoy my time in corporate business working with Wells Fargo as a company. They did not treat me in the capacity that I believe I can operate within and there was no tutoring or structure.
bad,"They were merging the call centers from all location the process was not well thought out they changed it daily which impacted the employees, they would often change your work schedule which did not give you a good balance between work and home life. They were not responsive/acceptive to feedback."
bad,"Everything revolved around the calls and sales to the customers. "
bad,It pretty much the same a deadline based workplace must be able to complete your work time is until complete. there flexible about letting you listen.
bad,"This job is tedious and can be very stressful. It's all about numbers and making sure your customer is happy when they leave. For me it felt like they wanted you to be like a robot, which isn't my style. This job is good if you like competition. The best compensation they offer is PTO and insurance. They do not pay tellers fairly, I worked there for 3 years and I was getting paid what the new hires were getting."
bad,"Very toxic culture. Management was so bad, they didn’t care about customer service. No room for growth because it was all about nepotism. Talent and experience didn’t matter, they promoted people with minimum to no experience. It was very stressful because managers were only worried about hitting numbers. Customer be damned. Good benefits but you’ll start to hate life."
bad,"Shady corporation who funded cafes for kids at the border. They only think of themselves "
bad,Job not as described. Horrible management. No defined requirements. Impossible to achieve job expectations due to lack of management understanding about job role.
bad,I was a Phone Banker. The training was great but once on the floor it was nothing like what I was trained to do and the support was limited. I felt like the sales goals were unrealistic and did not best interest the customers.
bad,"i loved the place of work and the customers, of course pay was great. the only problem that i experienced was not being treated fairly and felt harassed even after the workday was over. they have a very strict policy to not go over one managers head to the next. i had several issues with my ""teller manager"" and went to the branch manager for help and i got in more trouble for not going to my manager, the same manager that was causing the issues. not a good place to work, not with the manager who to me was racial."
bad,"Horrible place to work, they don't care about your family life or family. You're under paid for all the B.S. you have to deal with. Customers cuss you out all day due to Wells Fargo horrible systems that are always down or unavailable."
bad,"Outside of getting the series 7 and 66 this job has been the worst decision of my career. Management is terrible and the have know clue of what a premier banker does in a branch. The direct manager lets everyone walk over him and doesn't think or make decisions for the team on his own. Management picks and chooses when they want to enforce rules. The position is supposed to be relationship building and management but there is a significant amount of turnover due to the poor  ""manager"". They look at you as a machine instead of a person not caring about any major issues you may have going on in life. I wouldn't recommend this position to anybody unless you are looking to get licensed and immediately leave. However, no matter how unhappy you are in the job management will rather try to fire you then let you apply out even a month early."
bad,"In my initial interview I asked the interviewer 2 questions about the job. If we had to sell anything and if this was an all about the numbers job. He said no. 4 months later, he is now my boss and guess what....Its sell,sell,sell only they call it educating our customers. Also you get reprimanded for having to use the restroom outside your scheduled break. Dont waste your time applying."
bad,"That was about the most positive part of working for one of the largest banks in the world. Terrible benefits and insurance, soul-sucking office layout with absolutely zero privacy."
bad,"I think the only positive is that you get holidays off and the pay isn’t awful. At the particular branch I worked at 6 people left or are planning to leave within 2 months due to management. So if you work with Wells Fargo, good luck."
bad,Typical day at work was very fast paced and there was significant competition for recognition.  I felt like I had PTSD after leaving Wells Fargo Bank.
bad,"My first experience working for Wells Fargo wasn't pleasant. The Manager, Dausha Everett, would consistently be nasty in little ways to provoke me. Examples would include; poking me with pencils or pens hard, disabling my badge so i wouldn't be able to get into the building for my shift, speaking to me in a condescending manner when i needed assistance with a call, and making reference to my weight-telling me to watch it and that i shouldn't eat this or that. Many other things i could go on about. I ultimately quit because i could not tolerate her any longer and she made impression of Wells Fargo in general bad."
bad,"Wells Fargo will insist that you AND YOUR SPOUSE submit financial investment information for 'compliance' purposes, only to determine how to sell you their products and turn your account into something they will profit from. This was mandatory. I also experienced 'in-fighting among managers. If a contractor, be aware that if something goes wrong, YOU will take the fall. I witnessed this with many others, and first hand. Otherwise, the work itself is interesting and training is made readily available."
bad,"Lack of loyalty and accountability across the board! Major overhall needs to happen soon or the company will not survive in the long run.  There are some great employees here, but that needs to carry over into all of the departments. Lack of communication and mentorship."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"If you want to work for a bank, don't work for that scum bag of a company. It's just inhumane and a really awful place to work. I hope they've changed, and I hope they have a new CEO."
bad,"The management at the Covington, Ga branch are horrible.  They pick and choose who gets promoted.  They already know before the interviews.  They just interview all applicants to make it look like they are following guidelines.  If you’re not in their  “click,” you won’t promote, regardless of how well you do your job.  They need to be investigated. This needs to stop. They also gossip about employees to other employees and share confidential information.  So unprofessional!  Horrible place to work!"
bad,"Wells Fargo had a very poor sales technique and atmosphere during my time there.  Very stressful, negative, uncomfortable and poor environment to work 40+ hours a week in."
bad,"I'm on Indeed because I'm not happy at Wells Fargo. Bad management and no concern for staff. I work in a corporate technology group (not a branch) that has massive turnover. They only hire contractors to save on paying benefits and salaries are nothing special."
bad,Management knows very little. Tellers are expected to do so much with such little pay. They preach the opportunity to move up within the company but promotions are picked by favorites already.
bad,"The constant drumbeat of negative press from many years of criminal activities, unethical practices, billions of dollars in fines, etc., make this a truly horrific place to work. And management simply does not care what this does to a highly effective and loyal employee’s health, family, career and so forth."
bad,"Salary is good. Management is not so good. Goals are too high and it can be very stressful at time. They also have "" the good ole boys"" club and if you're not a part of it, it shows."
bad,"I used to love working at Wells Fargo.  They treated myself and my family well.  Then the account scandal happened and then the company set the wrong expectations with all facets of the organization.  Some had “Sales” goals, including myself, where the “Retail” bankers did not have sales goals.  My income was based on how many sales I closed and felt the organization did a poor job treating employees throughout the mess that top level executives created for the company.  Many good people work here, but they need to rid themselves of management that has been there too long and is still breaking the rules.  My boss even told me to lie on my expense report working here.  Are you kidding me?  He and many others need to go.  Wells Fargo has a long ways to go to rebuild its reputation.  They hurt me and my family financially because of the managements poor ability in decision making.  I used to love Wells Fargo, but have grown like the vast majority of others who now HATE Wells Fargo."
bad,Wells stresses that they have changed their culture after numerous scandals but thats far from true. Pay and benefits are great. Middle management is horrible. Upper management only cares about lining their pockets
bad,"you will always feel down and lack motivation after a while since they only focus on what you are not doing enough off which is loans and lines of credit."
bad,I was employed with Wells Fargo during the time they required employees to open false business accounts and even apply for unwanted credit cards for customers. I disagreed with these business practices so I resigned my position.
bad,The managers play very obvious favorites and if you are not picked as a favorite they will not work with you on anything from scheduling to personal issues. They will hold each employee to a different standard and even go as far as ignoring policy and procedures to accommodate their chosen.
bad,Worked there for over a decade. Always got underpaid. Management is a joke nobody has any decision making power. Benefits keep getting worse and worse every year.
bad,"I worked for Wachovia prior to WF. I *loved* working for Wachovia. Wells Fargo is nothing short of a toxic work environment. "
bad,Was great at first but than sales pressurecame and no one wanted to do things they were told to do. That’s all I have to say. Vacation was nice good to have
bad,"It was an unpleasant experience. It was also my first true corporate experience. I sat in an auxiliary room for a month without a computer. While there, I received approximately 15 minutes a day of ""training"" (essentially how to use the database)."
bad,"It was all about sales.  The managers didn't care about anything else. It was like being in high school again, gossiping and backstabbing.  The manager always spoke poorly of the customers as soon as they walked out the door."
bad,"The Lockbox Department is easy work, but it’s a stressful environment due to typical daily deadlines and a manager who has no tact.  High turnover rate because the manager is not very fair at all.  The manager constantly belittles, bad mouths and picks arguments with team members and assistant manager then denies such actions.  The manager picks favorites, so if your not a favorite, forget about ever getting the manager to listen to you or advancing your training or career.  You will be forever branded and frowned upon and not given any opportunity to better yourself within the company.  Reporting such problems to HR does not help and only serves to fuel the manager’s anger and will certainly retaliate.  Benefits and medical are great though.  Too bad HR does nothing to improve poor management."
bad,"the terminology has changed we are no longer able to say sale, or set goals but there are goals you do not get promoted unless you hit percentages and numbers even after senior management had the ""change for the better campaign"".  Everyone is pitted against each other, you always fear for you job unless you do what you are told even than if someone doesn't like you they call HR and keep calling until you are dismissed, or resign high turn over rate, terrible management. Customers are great but the stress is not worth it."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Wells Fargo is an awful place to work and build a career in. Very bureaucratic environment. You will advance if you keep your head down and don't ask questions. Great banking systems though however it is not worth working here.
bad,Management has you on 3 calls per day hammering sales into managers. Little to no work-life balance. Managers expected to be in 1 hour before anyone arrives and stay 1 hour after everyone leaves. Company stresses to do the right thing but leaders will pressure to do whatever it takes.
bad,Wack place to work. leaders don’t care about you and the market leader care less. Extremely high turnover rate all the way up to market leaders and area presidents
bad,"Underwriting is very liberally subjective at Wells Fargo. In other words, if you are conservative, you won't make it here in underwriting. No wonder they have so many loans falling off the face of the earth and no wonder so many people are filing bankruptcy and losing their homes. Wells Fargo should be ashamed of their lending policies."
bad,Not Applicable at this time due to job search.  Job was eliminated without warning or insight.  Management levels will continue to be eliminated throughout 2019
bad,Advisors are allowed to mistreat support staff and insult them.  Branch Management doesn’t do anything to help fix the issue. Lots of staff turnaround because the FAs walk all over everyone.
bad,"Numbers is all they care about, as long as you made your goal your job was safe. If you didn’t they would threaten you with your job everyday. District manager was the worst"
bad,"Internship was unstructured and the manager didn't have a clue what he was doing. Ironically, he's become the head of risk after all the firings that went on there."
bad,They called us into a meeting one day and advised us that we had 2 hrs to pick a job in 2 different departments and if not we had to sign a resignation letter
bad,"When you spend 50% of your time at work apologizing for bad publicity and poor management several levels above your control, it is embarrassing and not something anyone would want on their resume.  40% of the time is mass training to handle the irate clients with PR scripts and ever changing, contradictory process systems.  10% of your time is spent actually working.  It was incredibly frustrating."
bad,"I've had several positions at Wells Fargo and they've always been based on numbers and more concerned with that than the employee and customer. Some departments might be okay, but I was not that lucky."
bad,"I worked at Wells Fargo for 4 years and out of that time I was a teller, a lead, a service manager, a personal banker and a small business banker. I invested my whole being into this ‘career’ I was building, for it to be all over looked. I came in early, I stayed late... I went to early morning meetings and I was active in my community. Wells Fargo, has had many trials and errors, consistently and still to this day they cannot figure out a happy-medium on how to treat their employees or clients. I started with extreme sales goals, to no goals at all, back to integrating them once again (fun fact: goals are back and they are back for good). The managers they hire/promote, suck. None of them care about the team as people, but only as paychecks and they will pressure their team to get additional sales in order to meet their goals for their pay out. Management is not held accountable for their actions and don’t listen to what anyone else has to say. Suggestions are never taken into consideration and they get upset if you don’t 100% agree with what they do or have to say. They pick and choose what clients get special treatment and have no qualms about it. They will tell team members and customers what they ‘want’ to hear even if it’s not the truth to try and direct issues. Advancement is easy as long as you know upper management. It’s who you know, definitely not what you know. I will say, Wells Fargo Bank has taught me what not to look for in an employer. It was great work experience but I’m definitely happy with my choice to leave and personally I would never go back."
bad,No investing in new employees. No organization. Lack of culture. Went weeks without being given work to do which got very frustrating. There wa also of major lack in training resources. Manger was especially poor at doing his job
bad,"Executives are only interested in the bottom line, no time or money for the hourly. I would not recommend this company to my friends. The people I work with are the best part of my day."
bad,"I've never hated a job more than working for Wells Fargo. They only cared about how many new accounts you can open, how much loan volume you can accumulate, and didn't care about their customer's needs at all."
bad,"The management system is beyond unprofessional and unreliable.  If you ask a question, everyone seems to have a different, unsure answer.  The worst lending approval odds and highest fees for  customers. ""Team members"" are treated as disposable, replaceable; not valued.  Our benefits are great, because WF has to cover up the other treatment employees receive."
bad,Have a bad habit of hiring people to get a job or project done then immediately displaces employees.  This has happened to me 7 times and I have now learned to know longer accept jobs with them.  I need employment and I don't need to worry about layoff's ever other month.
bad,"managers, can make your job a difficult. get written up for the smallest error. but if you have a manager that likes their job you can grow fast but great company"
bad,Loved the work and pay. Management was terrible they always  looked for ways to make their employees miserable. The pay was good and facility but management was bad people were always going out on stress leave. If you are a mean and difficult person to work with that is who they hire for mangers.
bad,Very stressful and boring place to work at. Would not recommend this job to anyone. Very strict on meeting the goals monthly. The fees are ridiculous!
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Would not recommend anyone for this position."
bad,"If you are interested in harassment, a racist workplace, keeping secrets for upper management and blatant ethics violations then apply. I have worked for Wells Fargo for over 10 years and in each location the same antics occurred. Playing favorites, frat boy culture and harm to customers on every level. AVOID THEM."
bad,"Infantile management, a culture of allowing specific stakeholders to hijack projects, and a culture of promoting people that can suck up the most while blaming their mismanagement on others. There are some great people who work there, especially my peers, but the organization will drive them out."
bad,"promises made to get me to come over never kept. support nill...the constant bad press has made referral partners stop referring.."
bad,Very cliquey company to work for. Almost have to fit in to last here. Would never work here again. Management lacks in empathy unless you're a favorite.
bad,I would just like to share that if management/hr was more supportive of the non-management employees this company would be a list topper in employers.
bad,Sales practices encouraged and taught led to a constant state of fear and anxiety. Would never want to work here again or recommend anybody to work here.
bad,this was a high stress high pressure outside call kind of job. I have heard things have changed since they dropped the point system for your daily numbers but I would never go back!
bad,"Company culture is totally contrived: all company objectives are product pushing, and do not mind a client's needs."
bad,"My manager lied straight to my face daily, there was no training offered to me as i sat with one processor for 1 hour.There was no one free to answer questions"
bad,"Typical work place environment; nothing fancy, and not a place for upward movement; I would not recommend this as a place to work unless it was a last resort."
bad,Wells Fargo forced employees to meet extremely high sales goals. Many employees opened accounts for customers who never requested them and or had knowledge of them. The company CEO was fired because of these practices.
bad,The culture does not match their actions they gave outrageous goals that were nearly impossible to meet. The turn over in management was horrible and they did not care about the employees as much as they said the they would
bad,"Wells Fargo is not a place I would recommend to anyone the pay doesn’t match the stress. Managers are very unprofessional, and unorganized. They took away sales because their being sued but they still make you offer products to the customer. They don’t want the customer on hold for more than 20 seconds which is unrealistic they don’t want the calls to go over four minutes. A female co worker was verbally attacked by a male co worker and Wells Fargo told her if she hadn’t laughed he wouldn’t have reacted the way he did. Horrible way to deal with the situation, Wells Fargo has been a complete disappointment"
bad,"If you want to be supported by your leadership and be allowed to make independent decisions based on your experience, regulations, and company policy this is not the company for you."
bad,They only promote based on popularity. The people they promote never know what they're doing and the people who have been there a long time (that they refuse to promote) have to train managers.
bad,Was encouraged on multiple occasions to open accounts for customers who did not understand the product in order to meet impossible sales goals. Managers did not care and encouraged the very hostile environment. Could make mistakes with counting out money but were constantly threatened with termination if we did not meet sales goals.
bad,Very stressful place to work and with the on going scandals over the past two years Wells Fargo is operating in fair and through out logic and common sense out the window.
bad,I can only speak for the dealer services side of Wells Fargo but my experience hasn't been a good one. It's a new start up hub and has been stressful from the begnning. Managers don't know what they are doing and change rules and regulations on a daily basis. It's impossible to do your best job without correct training and  available help when needed. Managers have made up rules such as mandatory overtime and will tell you the day of and threaten to write you up if you don't stay. They have unrealistic expectations of their employees and no compassion. We feel more like work horses than employees. I don't recommend WFDS.
bad,"they fired or positioned everyone to get fired once they purchased wachovia, i did not like being financial specialist they have other and better positions in other departments but only friends of friends get those"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Now a days is a Good company and great people you just have to find the position that fits your skills best. There are many different avenues you can take. Good benefits and time off is automatically approved.
bad,Just don't start there and you won't be disappointed.management is depressing some are awesome some get there position by who the know not what they know.
bad,"Manager was the most difficult person I've ever worked with. Demeaning and not focused on employee training needs/advice/counseling. I worked there during the ""get the accounts at any cost"". It was horrible."
bad,"Do not recommend this company at all!"
bad,"Over 3 meetings a week, no life balance, employee needs to use pto for even half day while you technically 6 days a week. Micro management is an everyday business"
bad,"Company cared more about numbers, than their staff. Company was all about pushing product to their members, to produce their monthly goals.The most enjoyable part was working with my manager at the location."
bad,"They don't care about the employee at all. Is a very stressful job, all thy care is about them, they will ask for unreasonable things to do. They want you to do all this number even so they not good for the customer."
bad,This company is the only place I regret having worked there.  The sales requirements were out of control and there was so much unethical practices going on there.  Really glad the government finally stepped in and made the CEO step down.  This was the only time I ever felt compelled to call a ethics hotline.
bad,"district mangers are as corruptive as in store mangers. a lot of personal relationships. they would write employees up due to ""numbers"" that were insane to accomplish."
bad,"As a phone banker 1 I take in coming calls regarding the customer's credit card account, I assist the customer in a fast and friendly matter, as I assist the customer I also have to refer a product that can enhance there banking with Wells Fargo."
bad,Terrible sales culture and unrealistic sales goals. Upper management constantly forced you to bring in additional accounts. Employees were at constant fear of being written up for performance.
bad,"The management is terrible. There is nobody to answer questions or help when its needed. You have to use your pto for sick days and if you don't have pto, you can't call in."
bad,"Wells Fargo is not a fair company.  I recommend that there be training on how to treat ALL employees fairly and just.  Management has been shown to abuse authority and show favor towards different associates.  There needs to be a better process for disciplinary "
bad,The job itself was enjoyable.  Management made this position tough. There are too many middle managers at Wells Fargo who micromanage and it gets in the way of customer satisfaction.
bad,"Pay and benefits are awesome everything else sucks. From management down to how they treat their employees! A lot of favoritism and unfair punishments  because of the favoritism. Management is Constantly putting you down , telling you to do better and comparing different people to you."
bad,Local manager was GREAT but senior leadership lacked integrity and concern for those in the trenches.  Senior leadership made millions of dollars and the ones originating the loans were fighting to close every one they could.  After 6-8 weeks of processing loans may  or may not close due to lack of consistency and NO ONE made money but the TOP management.
bad,There is nothing good to say - great people working there except management. They were the worst ever and you were treated like you meant nothing to them.
bad,Manager was too young. They pushed selling checking and savings accounts  in a department where we only handled credit cards. Our job was dependent on us making sales. This made for a really really bad environment. I applied to help people and not cheat them out of money. I really hated this job which really affected my performance and subsequently... I just stopped caring about the job.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"I worked at three different branches during my time there, and they were all different client demographic and socio-economic backgrounds. It was a great learning experience."
bad,"I worked there when they still had strenuous sales goals and you job was on the line if you didn't meet their ridiculous expectations. Very crooked company to work for at the time. Might be better now, but I still didn't like the work environment at that branch."
bad,Forced to sell bank products and services to meet bonus was not what I call a nice work environment. Way to competitive. Thankfully they are tryin to make amends and change bank practices but I would never work there again or refer someone. It cost me my job and made it a stressful and hostile place to work.
bad,not a good company to work for . poor management doesn't care much about employees . They pushed sales unethically . Had to leave and apply elsewhere. Pay is horrible too
bad,"I do not wish the Wells Fargo ""culture"" on anyone. They are all about the money and could care less about the employee or the customer. I was told on multiple occasions to tell a customer something I knew was incorrect in order to get them ""off the phone"". Steer clear!"
bad,Very stressful environment the 4 years I worked there (2010-2014). I chose to leave because of the unethical practices upper level managers encouraged.
bad,"competitive, awful.  I walked out without even another job it was so stressful.  Sales goals were impossible to meet.  They treated us like robots.  Wanted us to sell services that people did not want."
bad,Not a good company to work for. At wells fargo the managers presure you for sales. The balance of personal life and work is bad. I wouldnt recommend this compny to anyone.
bad,I started out as part time teller and then became a full time teller.  After that I became customer service rep and finally promoted to head teller before I resigned.
bad,Not enough discipline and the good employees who actually do their job are taken advantage of. The staffing was never adequate and we were made to work like dogs.
bad,"NOT only was I not trained enough for the job I was placed in, I was fired because of it. 3 months later they were getting sued for what I got fired for imagine that. When first starting wells Fargo you are placed in this 6 week training where its make or break if you don't get it in training you are thrown on the floor and SUCKS FOR YOU. your given to the wolves without any other help. When your out on the floor you better make sure that you talk as fast as possible. make sure the customers do not understand you to get that sell and as soon as they say yes or sure you BETTER get them over to sales so they can be forced into some bs so wells Fargo can make money off of them. I didn't make the sales goals that I was given due to lack of training and no one around  me wanted to help me so I ended up being fired. 3 months later I found a job similar was taught what to do correctly and I am now one of the top managers in SALES in my company and all it took was a little training and receiving the help I needed."
bad,"awful management"
bad,"The department that I worked in, you did as you were told or else you didn't have a job. If you knew the answer to any questions or inquiries, you never told the truth to any outsiders. Managers told you to lie. If you posted anything negative on social media, you were automatically fired. You were also instructed to make up false accounts whether the customer had asked for them or not."
bad,"you will end up going above and beyond to keep your job if you are under poor management your job will be threatened daily. "
bad,"This job was a good job for San Francisco, but nothing but stress, and they were moving most everything to India. "
bad,I did not enjoy my time at wells fargo at all. I regret applying for a job there. the management was poor and the customers are rude. I was also not trained properly to do my job which is why I left.
bad,"Working there in collections, I had 7 different supervisors in 13 months.  The last supervisor I had seemed to ""have it in"" for me for unknown reason(s) and I was let go after she became my supervisor about six weeks later."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"toxic environment, highly stressful, unrealistic expectations. seems that no one ever knows what's going on.  underpaid and overworked is putting it mildly."
bad,"horrible corporate culture, as an employee you are treated like dirt and you are pressured to treat customers who are deemed poor young and minorities as such."
bad,"I left the company due to what you were seeing in the news. To be fair, it's possible the company has changed due to what happened and I was at a branch with a poor Manager."
bad,"I have worked for Wells Fargo for 13 1/2 years.  Starting out it was great.  You were rewarded for the work you did.  Today, you are not rewarded for work you do and there is no incentive to do more.  Raises are the lowest.  I am looking to advance and enjoy a job and coming into work. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people.  The team I support are wonderful and appreciative.  The hardest part is the frustrations of ups and downs and continual change. Management has been ok.  Nothing special.  I have learned a lot in system access and adapting to the Wells Fargo environment.  Work every day is boring.  Nothing to motivate or challenge you. I feel with the skills that I have and the experience, I would be a great employee for Athene.  I like to be challenged.  Wells Fargo does not promote challenges in my field."
bad,Wells Fargo turned out to make us just another number. They paid to train us but when layoff time came didn't think to give the ax. It is quite sad actually. Many good workers some being there for many years received the ax.
bad,"My typical day includes taking inbound calls from customers experiencing both fraud and non fraud on their accounts. Your success is based on how quickly you can get the customer off of the phone as well as how long it takes you to finish out the claim work after the call has been released. Wells Fargo pays very well considering I am young and still in school, but the flack that you are forced to take from the customers is not worth it. Granted, some of the customers are very polite and easy to work with but the majority are extremely belligerent and hateful. The amount of conflicting information that you receive from senior representatives as well as supervisors is ridiculous. Customers are also quick to bring up the recent scandalous activity that Wells Fargo has been involved in which makes for very uncomfortable phone calls. All around not worth it."
bad,"If you like stabbing people in the back, customer and agent than this is the place for you. They only care about the numbers, and to them you're just a number."
bad,Very rude staff. Too much favoritism. The staff was a bunch of hypocrites. The supervisor at the time was very rude and hard to work for. I believe she was even stealing from the company and never gets caught because she uses other clerk's till.
bad,High pressure position where every thing is watched and tracked. Culture is about meeting goals not serving the clients. Wells Fargo has been in the news for this culture.
bad,"This is another Call Center.  Heavy politics.  So many games.  Very bad software.  Incentives are rare because of unobtainable metrics. Working here you will be under a microscope.  Advancement is for ""Pets"" only.  Great experience and training ground for other businesses!"
bad,all together I don't think I will ever work for Wells Fargo again The not a family oriented company what's so ever There cruel and unfair they don't respect you at all as an employee
bad,Always complete chaos in a very fast paced environment and always short staffed. Very little communication from Managers because they simply had no time.
bad,"Great customers and worked with really good and professional bankers and tellers. Management was a large issue and the reason I decided to leave. Just two weeks out of training my branch manager was placed on suspension while our service manager was on maternity leave, so we had no management for weeks. Once we finally were granted replacement managers (after our service manger and our branch manager decided to quit) an unforeseen event occurred only two month later causing both to be fired. During my year with Wells Fargo I had 3 branch managers and 3 service mangers with a handful of temp/fill-in managers assisting while upper management looked for suitable replacements. I did not have the best experience due to the lack of direction and proper coaching. Aside from that, Wells Fargo is a great place for those looking to get into the banking/financial world. All roles are customer-service obsessed and looking to serve clients with a ""WOW"" (Wells Fargo jargon). Business attire is required with men wearing slacks, button up and most importantly a tie. I can't stress the necessity of wearing a tie enough. As long as you're a part of a good team with managers looking to help you advance you'll be promoted quickly."
bad,Did not care about my success.  I never received the proper teller training and was constantly written up when i was out of balance.  I feel like the managers do not have the employees best interest as long as they are getting a pay check they are good
bad,"They spend millions on advertisements stating how they are committed to winning customer's loyalty back... "
bad,Wells Fargo has a cutthroat sales culture. As evidenced by current class action lawsuits. I refused to actively market a product that had been identified as actively involved in identity theft. They used infractions from six and seven years previous as proof that I deserved termination. They later had to settle a class action lawsuit for doing this to many other people.
bad,"Unorganized, management unprofessional more about sales than customer service. Management in my opinion needs a lot of work. Should look in to replacing a few"
bad,Not a healthy work enviroment. Upper Management doesn't care about front line employess. They wont change. Total BS for a company rampant with nepotism.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Very unfriendly environment, unwelcoming of new employees. Rude coworkers, poor management, poor training, no updated materials for training. Culture is very fake all documentation promotes inclusiveness and diversity. Wells fargo seemed to have very seperated cultures, the different ethnic groups seemed only to stay within their group, management does little to promote a team environment and inclusiveness within the team. Alot of favortism, unethical practices. Uncaring people, zombie type of people, no smiles, no greetings, no acknowledgement of others. Very uncomfortable place to work, not worth the benefits."
bad,"Wells Fargo unfortunately was a wonderful place to work when it came it our customers but awful when it came to management. Or the Lack of.    Wells Fargo is too big for the unprofessionalism of their mid-management team.   I worked there for 5 + years and enjoyed the customers and most part my teammates.  But I saw the crumble of management and their way of training and keeping their staff on top of rules, ethics, and banking in general happen while still pushing numbers, volume and workload onto employees with little lack of compassionate to family and outside commitment.  I wouldn't recommend Wells Fargo to anyone who has an outside commitment.  Safety is a big issues as well. Unfortunately, your safety is not the biggest concern at the bank when push comes to shove. Feeling lack of security when working til 5 or 6:00 pm is concerning and can effect your everyday performance.    Disappointing support from such a large bank."
bad,The turn over rate was way too high. I worked with great people however management was lacking in all departments. the expectations demanded of the employees was very unrealistic.
bad,"It was honestly the greediest culture to work in day in and day out. I worked a 10 by 4, meaning I worked 4 days a week for 10 hours. 10 hours of just taking terrible calls from customers that we had to coddle in order to then get them to buy something. Sales goals were insane though I reached them everyday I would feel drained on my drive to work AND back. The management only cared about numbers and scamming the callers into opening up more credit cards and loans/lines or CD's. This company does not care about their customers one ounce which is now coming to light through their various lawsuits. I discourage even my greatest enemy from working here. They also expected you to come in no matter how terrible driving conditions were and if you were to receive 6 unplanned absences, you would automatically be fired."
bad,"I worked for WF for over 3 years, and this is one the most horrible companies to work for. HORRIBLE. WF IS A deceitful and corrupt company. I wasted 3 years of my life"
bad,We were pressured to sell things to people against their best interest. I understand why all of the fake accounts were made because management cared only about sales and nothing else.
bad,They have you shove credit cards and accounts into people's throats and they say the care about the customer experience but they treat their employess horribly and management only advances you through favoritism
bad,"Dealing with angry customers 8 hours a day everyday!! Very stressful work environment! Your job is to SELL, SELL, SELL. Or as they say refer beneficial products to our customers. You were under a microscope 24/7."
bad,"I was exhausted all the time, I did not have a good work/life balance. This job was extremely stressful compared to what they expected and what they paid. Very poor."
bad,"Typical day started off opening the morning and working on reports. I learned the power of working as team and building relationships with team members and customers. The hardest part of the job was the stress and the anxiety, due to lack of management. The most enjoyable part is the friendships that I made with fellow co-workers and customers.  There are is a lot of sales pressure and push to meet sales goals at any cost."
bad,"Would not recommend to apply for a job with this company. Bad Culture, Incompetent management, lack of support, lack of focus on consumers"
bad,Senior leadership expected employees to work minimum of 60 hours a week. Absolutely no work-life balance workplace. Many departments worked their employees to the point of physical and mental exhaustion and had to be ambulanced out of the buildings. This company does NOT care about their employees at all.
bad,"Disliked Wells Fargo, I didn't like management asking for me to ignore the US Patriot act, internal sales and cut throat numbers make management itch to get them any way possible even if it meant putting a customer in an unusable account. I did like having more opportunity to build personal clientele. Didn't like Management requiring Bankers to meet for a review in the middle of transaction to ensure banker is reaching maximum sale potential. The Training process was great and very well put-together!"
bad,"It's an extremely corporate atmosphere and the commission structure is completely made of smoke and mirrors. They will not show you how your bonus is calculated, it just ""is what it is"". Employees are treated like children, and if you make a mistake you will be written up. I advise that you do not work here unless you enjoy being treated like a child. Oh yeah, if you do a good job, you get a ""jeans day"" sticker, so you can wear jeans. Yes, a sticker."
bad,"Life with Wells is all about your management. First and foremost it's a banking job. It is what it is whether you're in retail, corporate or anywhere in between. During my time I experienced both quality and unbelievably pathetic leadership. Most of it boils down to ego and who can make the most money. There is an insane pressure on all ends for your business to make money (yes this is and should be a fact of life but at the cost of actively working to cut different business group's throats is counter productive.) often regardless of customer needs. "
bad,"throw away your soul, sell accounts to people who do not need them to destabilize their finances and you will do great for this company!!!"
bad,"Poor management and poor business ethics. I was specifically asked ""to choose between my family and how much I want this job"" by my immediate supervisor and her boss."
bad,"Wells Fargo is a huge bank where they dont give AF about you just the customer, and how much you can pander from them. They dont go by demographics when it comes to the type of people who have money, or who dont. Management is a lost, like Walmart, not enough tellers.  Bonus structure is god awful, CEO makes millions off of stock, that we as employees make happen, and we receive  NADA for it. I hope the bank industry changes and gets rid of the big wigs, and become union, would be very wise."
bad,"I liked a few of the people that I worked with, however there was way to much gossip. There was no training program which surprised me for a big company like that. And when I was doing side by side training all I heard was how the last supervisor got fired for certain conduct with an employee. I asked several times to have a supervisor sit with me but that never happened."
bad,"continuous call back  to  back , month review of all calls and if stats are not met  there  can be terminated . employees are not allowed personal items at desk.no bonus unless top collector"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,The customer service department for Wells Fargo Bank is very fast paced.  They focus and push aggresive sales and you are micromanaged daily.  The typical day will consist of 100 calls and half of them are irate customers.  A perk is they're training is top notch.
bad,"Pay is horrible for the amount of work and effort.  Sale culture causes bankers to do what is not in the best interest for the customers and shady tactics are employed to make sales goals.  Training is severely lacking and the management seems like they have little credentials in finances.  Professionalism is poor and the company's ""we care about our employees"" is a facade."
bad,"After thirteen years as an employee I discovered the truth. Wells Fargo started off as a company that cared for the employees; after growing for the past 10 years, the the employees became a resource to be used as cheaply as possible. The stres is unbelieveable."
bad,worked 6 days a week without any time off and was part of top branch in division. met clients in persona dn over the phone to discuss products
bad,"I learned that management and administration in the call center is only nice to you to a point, because you are helping them get their $600-$1000 bonuses/month. They do not care about their employees or the accommodations that some employees need. They say they will work with you, if something comes up with your family or yourself, but do not. The accommodations and HR department do not care and even when you call to make a complaint it's not confidential and you will lose your job, even if it's a legit complaint.  They also only care about making money and do not care about their customers. We were told they do not care about customers situation, they want us to get them a new product no matter the circumstance. That is why they have a high turnover rate."
bad,Cold calling a lot of hang ups.  Tryed to help some home owners and we did it and it felt good.
bad,Wells Fargo- The retail sector is very poorly managed. I cannot speak for other sectors of WF however their current situation for their local branches is highly sales based- their focus is on numbers not on the quality of the sales. The culture is weak. I was an am impressed with their HR- but not their branches.
bad,The tuba city branch has a terrible manager! It is her first job and has no idea what she is doing. Upper management is not any better for hiring her. Stay away!
bad,"Can be fun, work is easy, but no structure. I've learned that I can do anything when given the opportunity. Management need to be more visible and engaged in what is taking place on the floor. Teamwork means that people should learn how to work together. Come in with a good positive attitude and ready to work."
bad,Everyday was a productive day at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage.
bad,I enjoyed educating my staff in sales and delivering exceptional customer service.
bad,This was the worst place I had ever worked in my life. Management was terrible. Customer service is zero! If you want to be pressured to sell something to someone on every single call no matter if they need it or not.... or get written up... this is your place to work.
bad,"After my first week on the phones (still in the coaching/training process), I realized that to continue with this job as Phone Banker, I would need to compromise myself and my morals. I declined this decision and have since been looking for another job. I would not recommend anyone work here unless you are aggressive and only concerned with getting your quotas. If you want to help the customers, I suggest you go to another bank. You can look up many reviews about this company and why people have left/continue to leave all throughout the internet. Sadly, I did not fully comprehend what I was getting myself into. Please be wary and do your research before hiring on."
bad,The phone bank for customer service was more worried about selling people items than about helping them find answers for why the customer called into the customer service line.
bad,"If you like to push, numbers, numbers, numbers, as in sales, then it's for you, If you like to see people not seeing correctly get pats on the back, credit and advancement, then it's for you.  If you want to not worry as much about high sales goals and always do what right and best for your client...opps customer, then it's not for you."
bad,Sales goal to be met daily. Management to ensure goal is met with hourly check-ins. Co-workers are friendly and helpful.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Brokers yell at the support staff. turnover is high. No advancemnet opportunities. They brought in a manger from across the pond. The office admin asst had a degree in opera. May sound crazy - but it's all TRUE.
bad,Was hard being managed by someone who didn't know anything about processing or closing.
bad,"This review is not meant to be a complaint. It is merely a warning or a lightning rod for those who are either critical thinkers or career climbers, respectively. This review is also written from an analyst’s perspective; I was not in a sales or production type environment. I analyzed policies as well as identified/corrected procedural issues.  "
bad,"As an previous employer working at Wells Fargo for 3 years plus was a very good experience, however the management was poor and the over all company was not and is not loyal to there employers. I loved my job and the duties."
bad,"Seems that customers and employees aren't a priority."
bad,"Wells Fargo Advisors state they are all about customer service, that is not true, they are worried about calls per hour instead of giving quality customer service.  Employees are not trained well enough to assist customers.  There are no procedures in place on how to help customers, so you have to wing it. You ask a question and you get 10 different answers. How can a firm expect to help customers when the employees cannot get correct policies and procedures.  The firm spends to much time on non essental objectives instead of focusing on policies and procedures and making sure all customer service representatives processors are on the same page.  The firm does not value good employees, only if you can turn the numbers not serving the customer.  I am very customer service oriented and I can say after working for GE they have excellent training program and excellent Customer Service.  This is what I am used to and Wells Fargo Advisors does not have such programs.  They need to update there technology."
bad,Super high sales goals for impossible products in a bad economy.
bad,"management are not supportive when your branch is short staff of people running the teller line.  I literally have had to work with 1 teller at a 6,000 teller transaction store."
bad,"Horrible company to work for, its no wonder they are always hiring...they have a huge turnover rate there, because its such a horrible place to work."
bad,"The management doesn't respect the work you do"
bad,I worked one on one with our consumers and enjoyed helping them any way I could.
bad,"no job security, unrealistic goals, cruel company, bad business model."
bad,"Snapped at in front of customers, Guaranteed a promotion/PTO (soon to be father) and have been denied both. misinformed about incentives. Customer service was extremely horrible, they only want your money. The hardest part of the job was going to work. Most enjoyable when i got to finally got to go home. Was told not to go to the District manager; he is nice to your face about the situation and then tells management to get rid of the employee, he has seen it happen more than once. at the same time told by branch manager and service manager to lie to the District manager about service managers involvement with the tellers, and certain skill drills. Never given directions to one of the skill drills at another branch wound up being late. and SO MUCH MORE! Just a horrible experience i am closing my accounts and I am leaving this company. Horrible, the people are backstabbers! Beware!"
bad,"Pay is very low compaired to other national banks, push is never on customer service but to do WHATEVER means necessary to get your sales. Stores are constantly understaffed and there for you are doing the work of 3 people and customers upset about wait times. Poorly run by most management at all levels"
bad,Wells Fargo provides you with the opportunity to obtain the best financial information to help enrich your life and those of family and friends in regards to a healthier financial picture. Work week can be challenging for a manager.
bad,"Management is discouraging and unethical!! There are many days we are short handed and get no lunch break... I have no sence of job security and sales, sales, sales oh and their (managements) bonuses are the most important aspect of Wells Fargo at our branch"
bad,This job is nothing but a sales job. Day in and day out you are required to all but force people to sign up and open up banking products they do not need. Additionally you have to do well with customer satisfaction. If a customer gives a teller or banker anything but 5's on the survey the employee can be written up and fired.
bad,"A lot was promised, but not delivered. Training as a banker without banking experience was a joke! Gaming seemed to be a big part in order for branches to hit proxy (commission & quota). Bankers can be held liable for overriding checks for years to come. It was a nightmare. Calling ethics line & HR didn't even help. Forget about the commission your promised, you'll never see it!!!"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,not good place to learn managers very worst if you want to enjoy family life then you can think of joining
bad,"You're only as good as people ""say"" no matter what reality is. If you have friends in high places you will go farther. Treated like children. No movement. It will take you 10 years to get promoted. Unless you have friends in management. Productivity scale is made to be impossible to meet so they have a reason to terminate you if need be. Also refused to recognize my experience & talents."
bad,The office had many unprofessional matters happening throughout the day. People would literally cry about their work load. The employees would fuss and fight with each other. My old manager ran out of the office one day in tears because one of her employees stood up for herself and she had every right to do so. I fell down a set of stairs and my manager laughed about it even though I was under a doctor's care for approximately 4 1/2 months. Human resources failed to respond twice when I contacted them. Another employee and myself was told to keep our head down once we came to our manager regarding a work concern we had. The work issue was never resolved. I find the organization to be quite dusfunctional and there isn't any effective communication taking place within that particular department. My experience there was not pleasant at all.
bad,Worked for a 1.5 years and in that time they treat you like a number and you are required to make a sales proformance that is crazy for the current economy. Management wants you to preform and not ask alot of questions. Nor question thier work ethics.
bad,"worked there for over 3 years. The actual job itself was fine it was the management and how they run the place that was horrible. during a typical day i saw bullying, harassment, inappropriate behavior from both management and other employees and watched as a number of fellow coworkers became extremely ill and were hospitalized. the stress of constantly being threatened and treated as though you dont matter was horrible. once i left all my medical issues went away and then i realized i was also extremely underpaid (never had a raise in the 3 years I worked there)."
bad,"the line managers changed often, many were unqualified and ill-equipped to manage."
bad,"I worked for this company and was very surprised by the lack of values, ethics and management's accountability. The enviroment was always tense, never really a relaxing moment to breath or rest in between clients. Wells Fargo is very much engaged in making sure their name is on everything possible in the community, although they are the first ones not to be present for an event. This company instills no values on its management or other employees, it is all about the solutions ( number of products) that can be imposed on its customers, whether they need them or not. If the employee did not present a product (whether it was the right thing to do or not) the manager would take it upon themselves to embarass you in front of the rest of your team and question why you did not get that customer to sign up for ; a loan, a mortgage, a credit card, a car loan, etc. Chances of advancement are next to impossible, unless of course you are a ""Yes person"". Their incentive program is also very difficult to achieve, the goals are so far fetched that the normal person will not be able to achieve them. The lack of character and moral in this company are shameful and they are the ideal representation of what ""the big bad banks "" really are all about."
bad,"Wells Fargo was the most stressful place I have ever worked. There were constant double standards and cheating your numbers was rewarded. I enjoyed my coworkers and even my immediate supervisors were a lot of fun. Upper management, however, was a walking contradiction. Also, Wells Fargo fired somebody that was 3 weeks away from maternity leave for the most pettiest reason ever."
bad,Never have I worked for a company where you can only call the current clients and ask if they need a loan when they already have one. They closed all their branches and fired all their employees all over Nashville without rehiring them.
bad,"Wouldn't go back to work for this company because of the way they made me feel. I have pulled all personal and business accounts from Wells Fargo. Never, ever go to Wells Fargo. Health care was good and the training was excellent until after a year then the honeymoon is over."
bad,Make sure on initial contact with HR Representative that any phone conversations you have to record it for job security. HR changes there company policies on the day of first contact interviews;
bad,"Very large, complex, confusing and off-shore dominates the teams. Contractors treated like step-children, staffing agencies are also kept in the dark and then surprised.  No documentation, but highly automated tools. Be prepared for delays for on-boarding, without pay during the wait."
bad,Unappropriated management mindset. Everything you do in this company needs to fit and align with the personal interest of your branch/regional manager.
bad,"Worst company ever - does not give advancement opportunities, does not care about their clientele, does not care about their employees, and the constant job layoffs."
bad,"All management did was push sales on everyone. Wells Fargo cares about their bottom dollar, not about their customers. I'm very glad to be gone from this retched excuse of a company."
bad,"Don't work here unless you want to hate your life. Wells Fargo is a mega bank. All they care about are $$$. Most of my coworkers hated their jobs and almost always had a bad attitude. The management culture basically operated on one rule: look out for #1. I got three promotions, and then basically felt like I could never go anywhere else higher. Oh, and everyone who worked there was very superficial. Nobody really cared that much about anyone else. They said they did, and tried to make you believe it, but the underlying message was that corporate profits always come first."
bad,"I don't know why my supervisor didn't like me from day one, tried to push politics in out meetings ,i was pushed around in the loan servicing specialist department which already had a bad reputation going through and firing many of its employees and temps,  paid 15/ hour and was very complicated and stressful project, problem with Wells Fargo is the usual grouping and you have to kiss the supervisor and the manager's  to move up,  they think they own you once you get hired and you should appreciate the free parking , free coffee and the occasional donuts like we cant get some for a dollar at the gas station, got many many offers to go back but refused for my sanity. really bad company to work for."
bad,At the shoreview location a lot of favoritism is shown nothing good to really say about Wells besides the pay was great. Not a good work environment and at times feel like you’re not appreciated or valued
bad,no Ethical in supervisors . very dissapointed  will never wrk for this company again management will only Be on preffer for employees No bonus for christmas Or pay very low
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Very poor understanding of insurance business , overzealous managers , much distrust , unrealistic expectations of sales goals, management was not investing in employee training, management appeared  to be insecure"
bad,Did not have a good experience working here at all. Employed around the time of the Scandal of the President. Made working there horrible. Also the management team wasn't as supportive as they could've been.
bad,"It's a great opportunity to break into the financial industry, your education will be exceptional, but you need to have a strong self ethics and integrity inner compass or you will get swallowed up in the dirty business that is the culture of Wells Fargo.  The sales tactics are scummy and management still pushes hard.  Even post september 2016."
bad,Worked at Wells Fargo twice in my life. The first time I left was because of harassment that did not get taken care of by this company. Instead of doing anything about it they gave this person a warning. The second time I worked at Wells Fargo (after giving them another chance) the company let me go almost immediately because of over hiring.
bad,"Loved the local people I worked with. Other than that,  felt like I was on deserted island to fend for myself.  Not very good training. Just not for me."
bad,"Wells is an unreliable non reliable/ trusting business that doesn’t offer jobs with permanent positions. So trust me, don’t apply unless it’s for a part time/ temporary job."
bad,"To quote the prime minister of England, when it comes to working at WF, ""I'd rather be dead in a ditch"".  If you like working from home and not advancing your career, it's the place for you.  Politics, red tape, and dysfunction across multiple geographies.   Is SF, Charlotte, NYC, or Minnesota the hub of decision making?  One cannot collaborate as you don't have access to different floors in CLT (however, most work from home anyway).  If you have to pay the mortgage, then take the job.  Otherwise, hard pass."
bad,"Corporate bribery- run, don't walk. Straight white people need not apply- you WILL be marginalized in favor of others who fit the company's ""progressive"" profile. Horrible office environment designed for hyper-micro-management, worse than kindergarten. Leads and managers are picked based on who is in the ""circle of friends"" and not at all on skills or experience. Random demands for overtime while others sit idle. The number and timing of customer calls is closely monitored, but not evaluated for quality."
bad,Happy i got the experience i needed to prepare me for future jobs but never a company I would want to work for again. It was all sales regardless of what they said. I didn't like forcing customers to do walk overs and that was a big part of that job
bad,"Working in the OCS department at the Birmingham, AL locating was the WORST experience ever I would rather deploy to Afghanistan again than work at Wells Fargo. It's literally like highschool on that floor, no one knows what's going on, the policies and procedures are always changing, the don't care about the employees, and the managers/ supervisors don't know what they're doing. my old supervisor was a banker coach in a totally department, applied for the supervisor position, and got it with no previous knowledgeable of OXS. "
bad,The management is a joke. No one gets along with anyone and you hear the lazy managers whispering about it all day. No one supports each other and it’s constantly such an uncomfortable environment.
bad,"I began as a mortgage underwriter and advanced quickly to a facilitator.  The typical day was a 12-hour day, working 6 hours on Saturdays.  Training new underwriters on all programs and what to look for particularly when doing loan modifications."
bad,"There has been a bed bug problem in the operations building, but they still expect people to come to work even though it's spreading and has yet to be resolved"
bad,"It was very stressful, due to always needing to hit your quota for the day, if not then you would get warnings. You would also have coaching sessions, to try and help improve your numbers, but they wouldn't really give you the keys that you needed to succeed."
bad,"The building is very old at the Walker Rd. location; it used to be owned by Intel decades ago when bell bottoms were still in style. The inside hasn't changed much from what I can tell. During my 5 years (from 2014 - 2019) there they had complaints of poor air quality and circulation, heating and cooling issues, cleanliness, rodent infestations, little access to sunlight on the main floor, and the carpets and cubical walls were heavily stained. There was a constant smell of urine in the building and employees are micro managed and gas lighted into submission fairly soon after starting. Most departments no longer receive performance bonuses or referral bonuses. There was more than one instance of hearing about an employee killing themselves, either on site or off site, because of mental health reasons. Very high stress place to work. It is not for everyone. I would not encourage those with severe anxiety or depression to start a career at wells fargo."
bad,"I worked there 6 years ago in 2013. I don’t know if anything changed. But when I was there my branch manager wanted me to open accounts on customers behalf to meet my daily/weekly quota for opening accounts. As a banker my goal was to help ALL my clients succeed financially, that means I will not offer, or sell you, or open accounts and/or services that you will not benefit from."
bad,"The best comment I would say about Wells Fargo is they do have a great benefits plan for their team members (health, dental, PTO, stock options and 401K)."
bad,I hated my job at Wells in the Phone bank.  I was required to sell products and the stress to do so caused a ton of problems.  I quite because my anxiety was so bad.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"WFHM is not a great company to work for because they do not value their employees regardless of their hard work & dedication.  In addition, depending on which department you work for, it's a ""kiss butt, who you know"" atmosphere just to get a raise or promotion. I did NOT enjoy working for this company."
bad,"I worked the customer service department fort checking and savings. Employees and most management were friendly and Wells Fargo did provide it's employees health benefits. Wells Fargo also had small activities for employees to help build and maintain morale, and the dress code was casual. The drawbacks of working for this department is that employees were expected to sell ANYTHING to customers even if the customer already had every possible product and service that Wells Fargo had to offer. The hours are also a little inconsistent. If I remember correctly, employee schedules can change about every 3-months or so. I understand that time is money and call centers are usually micro-managed, but Wells Fargo is micro-managing at its worst. Managers often literally sitting at your desk breathing down your back."
bad,"Good pay and benefits but poor management and poor atmosphere. High retention rate. Bad reputation which leads to bad experiences from customers. Overall, I wish I would of got a different job then going through all the things I went through for a company that sees you as a number not a person."
bad,"Wells Fargo is a very challenging company to work for. Upper management, including executive management, is out of touch with their employees. I have worked in numerous positions within the company and found the work environment to be very negative. Management requires unrealistic goals. Customer service is very poorly trained and the amount of complaints the company receives cannot be handled by the minimal staff."
bad,"well if you are really interested in playing politics and you are really really good at it then go with it...too much of favoritism, no learning just old legacy systems and technologies, and as a BA no functional learning and the more you stay the more you go out of competition."
bad,"They keep marketing  that there is no sales goals "
bad,they find every little thing to knick pick at you while they stand around and do do anything. ITs meant to be a team but acts more indiviudal as well as a lot of drama.
bad,If you have a heart? Please Leave it at the door before going in. Nothing else to say!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They’ll have you try to sell everything to the customers even if they don’t need it
bad,Worst place I ever worked and I was a home mortgage consultant. I hated the fact that I had to break family’s heart and they would just say it part of the job. Yeah no I’m good I’m a counselor at heart I can’t stand for unjust and ethically wrong. I’m good ✌🏾✌🏼
bad,still sales what I like but Review from customer on payout suck and its hard to hit  number that we don't know what to hit so we have to try to get loan but don't know what number to hit
bad,Was told not to waste time talking to a lady who came in once a week. She had under $50k and very ill. My sales manager said send her to the 800# don't waste your time with clients that don't make money. Horrible management.
bad,"I couldn't in good conscience recommend working here to anyone. You're considered very expendable, and forced to adhere to dozens of Wells Fargo's own policies that dehumanize or deceive customers with the intent of robbing them. It's precisely what you imagine when you think of a financial institution; A handful of rich individuals idle by as their pockets get fatter and fatter thanks to ridiculous overdraft fees and other predatory business practices."
bad,"Push for service and sales, hostile work environment, no flexibility. Management is a joke so is headquarters and HR. People will call with complaints and concerns and nothing would be done."
bad,Run from the phone banker position it’s more to life. I do not recommend this job they are entirely too nosey and invade people’s personal life. Also they taunt and constantly nit pick there employees to get a reactions to pull the race card. Management is awful they do not have boundaries and think they need to know all of your personal life. There are better jobs that will respect you money isn’t everything’. Worst job ever
bad,"The pay and benefits were great. I thought I could deal with the horrid management for those facts, but boy was i wrong. Not ALL management was bad...but it only takes a few in a stressful enough work environment such as that."
bad,"It's all about numbers...all day everyday! Your not a person your a number, everyone is replaceable...doesnt matter what you did last week, what are you doing today....not flexible when it comes to life or family events"
bad,"In doc management review branch, horrible management. everyone else is great, but management is very biased. Office life is very liberal and one sided, and if they catch wind that you are not, you are their enemy."
bad,"This was a good experience for me. I learned a lot of skills and had lots of good opportunities."
bad,"Horrible corporate world however, I was very lucky with my last manager. If it wasn't for him I would have left long ago. The raises are minimal, the sales goals were supposed to be taken away but... all of the sudden it became credit goal focused."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"It is a call center, if you've worked at a call center before you will know there are better places to work. SUpervisors lack experience and leadership skills. Upper management is all about the sale regarless of any policy violations, it's not them that are selling so they do not care. Politics and more. It's an ok job but not a carrer"
bad,"Employees required to need hourly/daily/monthly quotas, resulting in many unauthorized accounts opened without customers' consent. Just read the news."
bad,fixed working hours since you are in customer service. Not flexible with time requests off for kids or school. Management was stressed and rifled down upon employees inappropriately.
bad,"Too much work assigned to you at once and not enough resources mgmt. never available to help you when you need answers. A place that favors certain people. Unfair and unrealistic quotas to meet. Very unstable place to work at."
bad,I would give Wells Fargo at least at this location the lowest rating you could give. The reason being the management was so poor here they could care less about their employees time and worked us to the bone. I was a part time teller and worked up to 40 to 45 hours a week and typically I would'nt complain but the times I was working was absolutely ridiculous. I came in at 9am to 11am and did not get off until 8pm everyday. Management never seemed to care that I was a mother and not getting off until 8pm and would never ask their full time employees to stay and work the late hours. I worked there for almost two years until I absolutely had enough I applied multiple times for the full time position and would never get it and yet I was training the tellers that had only worked there a month as part time positions that got moved up to full time positions. It doesn't make sense to me if I am not good enough to advance in the company why would you have me training your new employees and working me to the bone staying all hours of the night and not even getting to see my son? This is absolutely a ridiculous company to work for and I would never recommend anyone to work here. I also suggest that Wells Fargo update their hiring interview questions for the employees that already work for the company. I think that they should base the interview for current employees based off how they work in the company already and their knowledge and what the management sees in the current employee.
bad,"Wells Fargo is a terrible company to work for.  Although the manager I had was great, the company as a whole has unrealistic goals, putting unnecessary stress on its employees."
bad,Come in and do your job.  Wells Fargo management sucks. They don't care about their employees at all.  Its about who you know not what you know Come in and do your job.
bad,"Wells Fargo in Sacramento was a negative experience for me that often led me in a stressed out state. The branch I worked out was purely motivated by sales numbers and the manager would push the bankers to setup products that vulnerable customers did not need to heighten the ratings of the branch. Dishonest methods were used by several employees, including the manager, and when I refused, I was verbally attacked by my manager on a daily basis. I did maintain constant success in my customer relationships, which is the only reason she did not let me go, in my opinion. I was happy to leave Wells Fargo."
bad,"My overall experience at the company was poor. Management was horrible, I felt like the tellers were used for sales instead of there to complete transactions."
bad,"Now matter what any management might say, their words are meaningless, they hold you back with promises that if you just give them a little more you will get to the next level then tell you ""oops, they didn't approve you up on high, but you're doing a great job"" Stay away from doing business or working there. There is a reason why they are under Federal Over sight now , slapped with fines, and assets are caped until they fix everything. They will even tell the Feds what they want to hear while finding a new way to screw people over."
bad,"I worked for a branch where the manager was always completely unprofessional. The culture was numbers, numbers, numbers!The best part of the job was the customers."
bad,Management didn't have a clue on how to actually lead. The work environment is extremely stressful. My manager didn't know anything about the products or software.
bad,"Working for Wells Fargo was very stressful, frustrating, and seemed to have a revolving door for incoming and outgoing employees.  I went through 7 regional managers in a period of 5 years.  Changes to processes were changed frequently almost making it impossible to keep up with.  I made the decision to leave due to not only the chaotic work environment with no support, but also because of the moral and ethical violations the company was found guilty of (over charging fees, opening fake accounts, etc.).  I spent a total of 11 years with the company and was fortunate to have worked with some amazing people and gain great work experience but in the end left feeling completely deflated, unappreciated, and devalued.  The culture feels like everyone is replaceable, which everyone is so many people leave after only a short time working there."
bad,"Job is super stressful. They make changes without telling you and then threaten your job for not following new changes. People aren’t promoted based on work ethic or knowledge, they are promoted based on “attitude,” and it shows, as team Leads rarely know how to do their jobs. Their lack of knowledge can lead to a collector making “critical errors.” Make 10 “critical errors in a year, that’s right, ten mistakes in a YEAR, in a high paced environment , and they will review you for termination.  Managers seems  like they couldn’t care less about their employees. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,The culture was extremely cut throat the last time I worked there. Employees were required to get 15 hours of work done in 8 with no overtime available. Employees were not allowed to use the restroom unless they were on break.
bad,"Upper management having unreal sales quotas, creating a culture of cut throat management.  ""Crossselling"" products to customers that were not interested in being sold to."
bad,"Not enough employees to maintain workload. Management lacked training to develop and coach employees. Stressful work environment due to workload, high turn over and poor management."
bad,"Not that great to work at during my time at Wells Fargo, high turnover and very focused on ""closing"" sales to compete with other bankers. "
bad,"cutthroat, made to lie, forced to give up breaks for meetings, not enough support on the floor and then blamed for taking too long on calls because we were waiting for help, call times suck"
bad,"Loved my manager and she pushed me to be where i am today but the corporation wouldn’t attempt to match multiple offers outside of bank. They wanted to keep me in the company but wouldn’t offer anymore than entry level due to being a current employee. They also changed salary a year after starting and new hires were making more, with no experience, then seniored and high value employees."
bad,little to no guidance for new employees. high sales goals with negative consequences for not meeting goals. Not a team atmosphere. However some computer aided training was very helpful.
bad,"Even with a strong balance sheet and underlying financials, Wells Fargo management was not committed to growing the investment banking division or see to it that it succeeded. There was therefore a lack of strong leadership within IBK which trickled down and led to poor work culture."
bad,The companies reputation outside the community trickles into the work environment. They offer very little training which explains why the company as a whole isn't secure and continuously has fines. They would rather hire contractors train them for a week or two once they get the hang of the role the contact has expired with no extensions and then the cycle repeats with new contractors. This explains why the company is a mess. My experience working there has steered me away from ever thinking of working for them. Your information is not secure.
bad,"Too much pressure on opening new accounts for existing client. Very stressful environment,micro management, only focused on generating new business. No time for lunch , manager would get you even if you are in lunch time and if there is customer to open new account."
bad,It's been awhile since I've worked there and things may have changed but at the time there was too much cross-selling especially since it was collections.
bad,"You get insane pressure from management, no path for promotion and benefits that get stripped away year after year. What's more common is that management will put profits over people, whether that's our customers or the team members. Now that's not to say that all management is like that, there are good people trying to make a difference."
bad,Managers have limited technical experience which make them very difficult to deal with when your job is to support technology.  The managers have no idea what you are asking for and they do not care as long as they can sneak out early.
bad,If you want to work in a company in which you have to make your manager or supervisors feel important and super valued in order for you to advance. Then apply.
bad,"Although the benefits were good my pay personally was okay, the positives stop there.  Everyone around me was underpaid and stressed out of their mind. We were required to initiate and continue having sales conversations to clients who already told us no.  Our hours were all flex, with no more than a weeks notice if lucky, and no regard for our personal life.  Required meetings were teach employees how to talk any client into a new credit card, loan, account, etc.  "
bad,"I worked on the deposit side of Wells Fargo and this quote was the first thing someone said to me the first day I started."
bad,"Management is very horrible If your a teller, and good luck if you want to move up. They can care less about you, everyone has that look up miserable."
bad,"Worst decision was to transfer full time to the edinburg branch. culture is not what wells fargo invisions. if you dont agree with their point of view they will find a way to get rid of you. management says they have open door policy, but only want to know what is going on to put it on your file and call HR to protect themselves, no sense of comrade work environment."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Working at Wells Fargo was by far the worst experience I have had in my professional career. Managment was extremely unprofessional, unethical, vindictive, and unrelaible. It's no surprise to me that this company stays in the ""hot seat""."
bad,over the years I hoped to advance but since every branch I ever worked at was short staffed I could never advance since they needed me to stay... and you have to ask permission to go to the bathroom like a child… so belittling
bad,"Almost every single person who I worked with, who have also left the company, have serious problems with depression and anxiety. Some of these former co workers also have serious alcohol and drug problems. For the most part these individuals were not in this state when they began working there."
bad,"I was one of the few people there with kids and they were not empathetic or flexible when I had issues when ut pertained to my children."
bad,The Banker and Teller training at Wells is great! I learned a lot about selling techniques. The problem was the pressure to open accounts that were not necessary for customers by management and them making you feel like you were not doing your job unless you opened these accounts. I went home feeling like I was not doing right by our customers which were college kids from DU and they had no clue about being financially responsible or accountable.
bad,"Everyday I went to work was worse than the day before. My co-workers were fantastic and management for half of my time there was great, but the bank was in the thick of their ""sales push."""
bad,"I hated my job, my manager was horrible and no one cared about the employees, we were an after thought and if you complained to management your complaint fell on deaf ears"
bad,"Working at Wells Fargo provides good benefits & pay.  That's where the ""good"" ends.  Many people say this & it may or may not be true, but I honestly believe that you would be hard pressed to find 50% of any Wells Fargo employees in any branch/office say that they enjoy their workplace atmosphere.   If it wasn't for the pay, I would leave in a heartbeat.  Management gives employees NO moral support. This creates a horrible workplace atmosphere.   You may ask why I still work here.  Like most other WF employees, I'm always on the lookout for the next job, so I can here out of here!!!"
bad,"Terrible work environment. Unless you're extremely interested in finance or love high-pressure sales, do not apply. I worked here for 3 years and got less than a dollar raise, across at least 3 review periods."
bad,"you are constantly micro managed by everyone, not just your actual supervisor, the company makes you offer and sell products even if customers do not need it, company does not care AT ALL about customers and they just want to take EVERY SINGLE opportunity to charge more and more fees on anything they possibly can, it does not matter who you are you will always be screwed when you are a customer in this company, no matter if you have money or not, they will make sure they take money from you and let customers talk down to you as much as they want"
bad,"Worked here for 4 years, it's been nothing but nepotism and favoritism and abusive behavior. I had managers tell me I was worthless, or that I'm a piece of trash. I've had them pull me into their office to scream at me for over an hour for things I didn't even do. My most recent branch manager went out of her way to get me fired because I reported her for harassment. The district manager doesn't care about anyone but the upper management, so our voices never get heard. Place is a hole and it's not enough pay for how much of your soul you have to give up."
bad,"Stressful and volatile environment to work in. Some managers are good, however, they promote from within and often managers are hired that do not have quality managerial skills."
bad,This company actively destroys the job satisfaction of every single person I have ever known to work there. They don't care about people. No amount of new metrics will fix that.
bad,Hated it I would never ever ever in life recommend anyone ever working here. They are liars they switch schedules etc I just wouldn’t expect any growth
bad,"Not a good fit for anyone wanting to be in banking.This position serves as the subject matter expert in the area of retail branch sales and services. Focus is on using a consultative sales approach to proactively identify both consumer and small business customer needs, and to build and deepen relationships by finding customized solutions to meet those needs. Ensures customer needs are met by referring to other line-of-business partners for additional business growth opportunities. Demonstrates passion for delighting the customer by living the Customer Covenant every day."
bad,"Banking sales poor management , horrible culture, turns over, terrible management,  good to work with money and finance but mediocre management Boring"
bad,"Wells Fargo is a good company to work for. Due to recent events that landed them in the new has taken a toll on some lines of business. I no longer want to be a part of the reputation of Big Bank."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Worked for wf for over 7 years and was a dedicated employee that protected wf through all their scandals with friends family and customers. They will not be there for you in the end and could careless what mistakes they have made they will fire you in a heartbeat.
bad,The position could be great. But managers make the job very stressful for no reason. The customers and coworkers are great. The bank itself is actually a great bank. But this pocket of idiocy spoils everything.
bad,The way the company has implemented controls required by bank regulators has caused high inefficiencies & bureaucratic mentality that make it difficult to effectively perform job duties.
bad,They churn and burn through their employees and refuse to pay them what they are worth.  The upper management does not treat their employees as if they should be in the same room as them
bad,If you want to be treated like a child and work without growth work here. If you're a person of color the management will make it impossible for you to grow.
bad,"Company runned by unethical managers. a lot of favoritism and dishonest managers. New hired underwriters have to take test cases and will get fired if they fail. managers don't tell you this during interview but after you start employment.  managers should be honest with new hires about the process. the testing process for underwriters is not realistic. they set you up to fail. managers  terorize their employees. you are walking on egg shells day in and day out.  this  company has a lot of clean up to do.   managers don't know their job.  Wells Fargo stop deceiving people. Greedy management. they don't really care about the company reputation but their bonues.  they don't care about their employees. its a shame"
bad,"Sales practices rule the entire culture when I worked there and it was a terrible environment to thrive in. Great people there though, made great friends"
bad,there's sales goals. they tried to do a change for the better after all the account openings but already corporate is talking about bringing back goals. of course they don't say sales goals but everyone knows that.
bad,"I have no words to describe how poor of an employer Wells Fargo has become in the past 2 years."
bad,"My experience at the Wells Fargo branch in Heber City was extremely stressful only due to the fact that management was racially discriminatory."
bad,"Contractors beware, regardless of agreements/promises, you may not be hired, or may not be hired for the position or at the pay discussed."
bad,"Believe everything that you see on TV and read about this company's corrupt culture. Whistleblowers are retaliated against, and management is totally immune to reprimand, even if they commit illegal or unethical acts with evidence to support claims against them. The human resources department is totally ""in bed"" with management, and papers the files of anyone who speaks against management. I hope that this company gets a complete overhaul and/or broken up as a result of the consent order against it."
bad,a terrible company to work for. they make you do unethical sales practice. they make you take advantage of the elderly and you do not feel good about yourself at the end of the day
bad,Most employees would arrive at work early and not punch in so that they could try to achieve the goals set by the company. Goals that were set did not apply fairly to purchase transactions in NY
bad,"An extreme amount of pressure from management to produce and from sales to approve loans and waive conditions. Many of the mortgage loans are not properly documented according to agency guidelines. Additionally, many of the loans approved do not actually meet agency guidelines. However, the pressure from the sales-side of the business to approve ALL loans is overwhelming. I feel that this company allows sales to control the business, and ultimately, this company will be on the forefront of another collapse of the mortgage business, as we have seen with the financial crisis of 2008."
bad,"Although I consider Wells Fargo as a whole to be a good company with great benefits and a great training system in force, I do have to admit that when I worked there management was severely lacking. I felt like a number instead of an individual. More and more was asked of me, but I was not given the same courtesy when it was time for them to help me with the smallest requests and accommodations. Also the compensation was not at all comparable to other companies in the banking industry."
bad,"I was a contracted analyst for a year.  I was promised this would be a perm position.  several higher management changes later, (upper management brought over their workers from past companies) the budget was lost and after my contract I was no longer considered for a perm position"
bad,work environment was not good supervisors didn't seem to have experience in there roles. it also is a very unprofessional place to work drama and gossip seemed to be more important then actual work
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,This job was a joke in every shape form and fashion. Great benefits and very good PTO setup. Manager was not experienced at all. Mostly dressed like a 70s bum and never took time to train staff and was uneven at best when it came to being a solid leader. Mostly would complain about upper management and would never take responsibility for anything. Favorites were clear as extended breaks were given to certain employees and others were penalized for trying to take the same breaks as the favorites. Over all the company is recreating it's platform every 3 months as wells Fargo has no true identity. I was told I wouldn't be promoted and told I wouldn't get anywhere from a dead beat manager that probably don't have a job in a year. Best of luck
bad,"Management bases schedules and work environment on their personal life and likings. Customers unsatisfied with policies, and compamy conatantly involved on bad press"
bad,"I was worked like a dog for not a whole lot of pay and treated absolutely unfairly. Managers are under trained and inexperienced. My managers were so jealous and scared that I would out-shine them so they became mean, rude, and would go out of their way to point out any ""flaw"" mistake and overwork me to look unsuccessful and behind service level agreements which allowed them to write-me up (performance improvement plan). In my entire working career; I've never been written up so that was my queue to find employment elsewhere where I would be treated equally and respectfully (plus get an honest days pay for an honest days work)."
bad,"Pay was not good, people that got hired after me got payed more. Fored sales on costumer and got pushed in to it day after day. I had perfect wow scores."
bad,"Typical day at Wells Fargo, Helping customers over come financial issues.  I have learned many things with Wells Fargo Training Programs.  And appreciate everything they have provided for me."
bad,"Stressful production environment with unrealistic goals and compensation plan including commission tier requirement levels consistently being changed making it difficult to reach. Salaries pay levels are low and as time goes on job functions and job promotions come with more responsibility and minimal salary increases, even when promised. This job position does not provide for work/life balance. You know what time your shift starts but management production expectations make it difficult to know what time you will be leaving each day. Only the supervisors friends seem to move/advance on and get the best days for time off work."
bad,I was in the call center and they wanted us to push all kind of products to people. I understand it was a sales job but why would an 80 year old need 7 saving accounts or 5 checking accounts? They dont care about customer service. You are a  NUMBER to them and thats all. stop opening accounts on people that they dont need!!
bad,"Competitive, they waste money, too many offices, too many loan officers and real lack of management accountability. The banking branch system has become almost critical for any loan officer to survive there.  The good old boys club dominates here as it does at BofA."
bad,"Overall, slow adapter of technology, horrible management, below market pay, infinitely unethical company. You are locked in at the pay rate you are brought in at and it takes a miracle to get anything but cost of living adjustments as your raise."
bad,"I did not like working at Wells Fargo.  At the time it was too much pressure.  Manager was hateful.  I quit working there before all the scandal stuff came out.  I don't know much of it.  Never saw anything suspicious or was ever involved with anything I felt went against the code of ethics there.  Was my role a perfect one?  NO, I made mistakes. One reason why I left was one too many mistakes, and I was being overloaded with work, going in as on a temporary basis, I was working full time schedule."
bad,management wasnt trained well. they gave me a book with what they expected me to do and never really helped. one manager hit me and the other one kept using profanity toward me. the goals where set way too high without making mistakes. pay was extremely low for the amount of stress you were under.
bad,"I have worked at Wells Fargo on three different occasions for three different positions.  The pay is decent, and the last position I had paid significantly better; however, I would come home crying every night as the stress was too much to handle at times, and the constant fear that I would not meet my production and quality goals (our production goal was 90% and quality goal was 100%)."
bad,"Fifteen years ago it was such a great place to work , the last 3 years has just been miserable and if not for thw wonderful people I work with I would have been gone long ago."
bad,"It's typical old school banking. Managers don't understand what's going on, and executive managers are even more clueless. It's kind of scary actually because their systems are falling apart. "
bad,"My day is dictated by when the phone rings, Emails received and close date. I work with cooperate relocation clients, focusing on delivering superior customer service while assisting with maintain the business relationship with my client's employer. Their satisfaction or dissatisfaction can dictate future business."
bad,It is a very difficult place to work. Tremedous responsibility with little power to affect changes necessary to complete our jobs. We are at the mercy of other systems groups to achieve almost everything but are held accountable for their mistakes. The management leaves no growth path for my career.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Wells Fargo doesn't care about their customers/clients.  They have been in the news lately for their malpractices and pushing products that customers don't need."
bad,"It's a little too late for them to change the culture.  Ive gone through many downs, not very many ups.  Management isn't trained properly and half the employees don't know what's going on."
bad,"They are poorly managed, and you cant get straight forward answer from anyone you ask. If you do well they just add more work, and don't give you an extra pay."
bad,"I love wells fargo and it has been a pleasure to work for  this company. I love the management also. I like the fact that we are like a family we are small"
bad,"I'm honestly absolutely miserable with working here. The pay doesn't equate to the work you do. Furthermore, I work six days a week and my only off day is Sunday. We're severely understaffed and in need of more bankers but they won't hire anymore. When you try to get a promotion, you're blocked. I dread going to work every day and I hate feeling like this. I'm currently looking for another occupation away from Wells Fargo."
bad,"When I first started it was Wachovia and they were an awesome place to work for, Management was great, liberal leave time and flexible schedules if you needed. They genuinely cared about the employee. We had cook outs and after work get togethers and all sorts of fun activities. Once Wells Fargo took over it was a whole new ball game and not a very good one for the employee."
bad,Wells Fargo Needs some improvement on there practices with there managers. When I was a teller I was happy where I was.I should have never transferred to the other department but i wanted to expand my knowledge and learn a different area. The managment team at the department I went to was very hard to work with and things just went downhill for me with the company from there.
bad,"one of the lowest paying banks an stressful always stress about monthly numbers an whether they wil fire you, an the position is not  jobbonus position. stress"
bad,"low pay, to stressful , and management is horrible, they will fire you because everyone is easily replaced , that should be the companies policy , its a joke okay benefits though"
bad,"Workdays are long, you have a time to start work but ending time varies day to day.  Procedures change daily and management is unprofessional & no room for advancement.  Some days sitting for 12 hours."
bad,The people I worked with were great but this was not the culture for me.  Do your research to make sure it is right for you before accepting any offer of employment
bad,"In a standard review of the above company, they are like many of their peers in may ways. In a recommendation to others, I would have to hold my breath."
bad,"Wells Fargo CSR call center was a bit challenging with the talk time and having to sell unnecessary products to the customers."
bad,"the managers are VERY pushy, sales have to be met or you get written up. The pay is great, and, if you like getting written up 24/7 this is the job for you. If I could, I would give my ENTIRE EXPERIENCE a zero at Wells. The managers are unprofessional, and down right rude to customers and especially staff members. At Wells, you are just a teller number instead of a human being. Your son / daughter / any family member could be dying and they could care less. They are a TERRIBLE company to work for. If applying good luck!"
bad,I would not recommend this department to anyone who is looking to apply. This department's management is not equipped to properly handle the the encouragement and development of this departments employees.
bad,Wells used to be a great place to work.  Not anymore. Mgmt is so out of touch with what is important to both its employees and its customer base.  They just dont get it.  Im over it.
bad,"Working there wasn't very pleasant they had a huge turn around rate there and I soon realized why. SALE, SALE, SALE, Wells Fargo pushes their employees to sell their products even if the customer does not show any interest."
bad,Management is horrible and there is no consistency. Benefits are wonderful if you can handle I very stressful environment.
bad,"Unforgiving company.  Asks Nation for forgiveness with recent fall out, however, will not do the same for their employees.  Loyalty is not reciprocated."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,I very much enjoyed the work and customers. I was not pleased with the outrageous sales quotas and the intense rivalry it brought on with certain co workers. created a lot of animosity. management was lacking in the areas of team building and morale.
bad,"Wells Fargo is by far the worst place anyone could ever work at! All Wells Fargo cares about is getting solutions and selling, selling, selling even if the customer doesn't need a product! I literally had my service manager stand next to me and tell me to offer the customer at my window a savings account because she had a young boy with her. My whole 2 weeks of training consisted of training me how to sell. Instead of training me how to make deposits, withdrawals, transfers, I was taught how to sell and then how to sell to customers who said no. If it weren't for the drive to get sales, i would most definitely love this job."
bad,Wells Fargo let go about 10 people who happened to be 55 and older.  I would not recommend working for them. They are not dedicated to people who have many years with them.
bad,"This position is not customer service, its primary sales. The bonuses are due not exist. Customer service takes the back burner and no one stays for over 6 months that is why they have to hire people every 6 weeks to take the place of the people that quit or are fired."
bad,The company does not care what you think or to help at all. An extremely pushy sales environment all they want you to do is get you to make people sign up for credit cards.
bad,"Wells Fargo coaches employees to open accounts customers don't need i.e. travel accounts or a 4th savings account. Actually getting a personal day that was previously requested is like pulling teeth."
bad,"Company doesn't understand the difference with reality and computer generated reports. Company have set goals that needs to be achieved in order to receive bonus but the results is not very rewarding. Bonus payout have deceased dramatically and not for the good of the "" Team Members"" ( employees)."
bad,too much emphasis on getting customers to open accounts they don't need. minimum 10 hour days and high staff turn over so we were constantly short handed there. It really turned me off of banking which is unfortunate because I was very excited to have a career in that field.
bad,"I was never properly welcomed to the team. They were very indifferent from day one - the district manager was by far the worst, their conference calls are demoralizing and embarrassing. No sense of positive reinforcement and they hold their team members to different standards; if you're not their favorite keep your eyes on your shoulders."
bad,"long hours"
bad,turn over rate is high. if you need a job just to pay bills until you get better job go for it. otherwise forget it.  all you do is pick up drop off customers all day.
bad,"Wells Fargo likes to spread out their work load to the extent that many employees see very little variety in the types of processes they perform. This results in higher production but also in people with limited skillsets. The repetition of work from day to day results in poor job satisfaction and eventual burnout. Also, they keep a close eye on workers' time spent at work vs break. The phone system is used to ""clock in"" & ""clock out"" for breaks and end of shifts. This demonstrates that they have no faith in their workers."
bad,"The bank has other reps force customers over to you, mostly wantin loans of $150-$500 dollars which wont happen. This is all under the guise of having their ""accounts reviewed"". Those who succeeded at seilling mostly cheated the system"
bad,"Management is condescending, everyone is out for themselves.  It is all about the numbers and nothing else.  Horrible culture, horrendous company.  Worst 5 years of my life."
bad,"High turnover rate with supervisors and management. Management micro manages, and constantly summons employees into the office for every minor infraction, whether it is justified or not. Many of the reasons given are so petty, that it appears that they are merely used as a scare tactic, or a power trip.  Management let you constantly know who the boss is, and that your every move is being scrutinized. It is extremely rare to receive praise, so you feel like a number. Favoritism is rampant. The entire atmosphere is one of hostility, and blame, and is extremely juvenile. Co-workers are extremely passive aggressive as a whole, jealousy and back stabbing is rampant. There are only a couple of people who are trustworthy. We only had a workforce of around 20 employees, and most of the employees previously worked together for many many years prior to wells fargo. They will smile to each others faces, yet constantly gossip about each other, and take everything they say, back to the supervisors.Everyone seems to hate their job, and every single coworker I spoke with, is constantly job searching. I would not recommend employment with this company to my worst enemy. It is not worth the pay."
bad,"Made a lot of money, but it was like working for Hitler. They are an evil company that hurts it's employees and it's clients. I was there for 9 years and if you saw what goes on behind closed doors - you would be amazed. You wouldn't believe how unethical Wells Fargo is. You would be shocked if I told you what they do to their customers. I walked away from a 200K/year job because I couldn't sleep at night anymore working for them."
bad,"I was doing great in the beginning... When the mortgage rates dropped to the lowest point, everything just went crazy... Processors who normally have 30 files now had over 100. Upper management basically told us to just tough it out. That obviously wasn't the answer because most of our office left for a different company. They also didn't pay me any overtime. Office life was wild... most unprofessional office ever. Someone punched a hole through the bathroom door, and someone else decided to show off a very personal ""toy""... There was also baseball being played in the office a few times which was very distracting."
bad,"Started out as a fun job with wonderful co-workers, but within a year Management changed lots of rules making it a very difficult/stressful job."
bad,Sales goals are too pushy and makes employees feel uncomfortable.
bad,"This company now under another name was poorly managed, could careless about its officers, the supervisors preferred to run their officers from the main office and never went to the sites."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Selling and referring customers to customer service for the final sale. Balancing a daily cash drawer. Balanced the main vault for several months at a time.
bad,Answering phone calls from customers requesting credit line increases. Review credit bureaus and discussing options with customers.
bad,"Upper management has difficulty adjusting to the HR control enforced by the merger with Wachovia. Sales are a constant push above the norm, as they reach to exceed 5 billion per quarter in profit. Company is willing to sacrifice senior staff and replace with lower cost staff regardless of performance to hit profitability goals. Very short sided. "
bad,High pressure sales environment.  Sales goals apply to every employee.  No support from upper management.  Sales goals are unrealistic and always rising despite the economic condition of individual areas. Failure to attain goals usually results in termination.
bad,"a typical day at work includes back to back calls , from mainly angry customers wondering why their accounts been overdrawn. This is not really a customer service job but a sales job. In the interview it seemed very easy  as I was told  the phone banker 1 position is customer service and just transfer some interested callers to sales for products and  services. The pay is great for a call center job. If you are good at sales this is  the job for you. "
bad,"Sometimes working for a really large company could be a good thing, thats not the case with Wells Fargo. Too many processing and underwriting issues in the company. They are not very competitive when it comes to compensation and upper management treats their employees like #'s vs real people. I have not had a good experience working for this company."
bad,working for wells fargo you are expected to portray a certian standard because they are who they are not able to be yourself there standards are high and mighty. They do not look at the customer they look at Numbers and goals co workers were great hardest part of the jog was the balance between work and personal life Days end
bad,"My day start at 1;00 PM. When I arrive I sort incoming mail and set up our work station for the arrival of our branch bags through out the evening."
bad,"Suppose to be customer service but is all about sales. Extremely aggressive with sales goals. If you don''t get their expectation for the day, you will be baby sat while on a call.Management doesn't treat you with much professionalism."
bad,"After working in banking for more than 5 years, I made the worst move ever and joined Wells Fargo as a part-time teller.  Branch Manager actually had the audacity to say to me during week 2 of my employment that I needed to produce more sales because he could train a monkey to do my job.  All they care about is sales, which I can do, but when you work in a branch that has customers with over $170K in a checking account, it's difficult to sell these customers on their need for a credit card or line of credit. You would think client retention and customer service would take precedence, but not here. Asked to be transferred or to allow me to apply internally to other branches but this same manager said he would only give me a poor recommendation since I can't sell.  Was #1 in region in sales at Chase Bank.  Banking is a great job but THIS is not the company you want. (Chase was a great employer)"
bad,"Prior to management changes this was a fantastic work environment. The team was well balanced and everyone got along. After management changes, there was finger pointing and no accountability."
bad,"Seriously, awful."
bad,"There is no job security. There is no such thing as work/life balance. The job ""sales"" was not exactly the job."
bad,"Of all the jobs I have ever had, the transition to this job was the worst.  They hired more people than they had desks for.  This put ""the newbees"" working from home most of the time when it is very important to be near seasoned team members to get acclimated to their systems.  It was four months before each of had a desk."
bad,"This job became stressful because management always pushing for sale referrals, warms, and much more. Most customers call in just to get balance, or to go off. But wells fargo trains employees to be shrinks and therpiest to these crazy spoil rotten customers. I did better working at a daycare... this job will make you hate people...everyday i felt like someone dumped their problems on me and i couldnt do anything about it. Banking call centers are the worst...high turn over rate because people feel disrespected after an 8 hour days work."
bad,"A typical day was servicing customers by replacing debit cards, opening up checking accounts, savings accounts and welcoming customers to the bank.  I helped Loomis and another teller many times when Loomis arrived.  I helped load the A.T.M. and balance the vault. "
bad,Handling money of customers and bank. Expected to make sales from the teller position which is near impossible. Very pushy and fake feeling.
bad,"Sales and referrals are up most importance"
bad,", where to start? Workers are treated sub human - like meat to the slaughter. Easy come, easy go. That's why there's a super high turnover - EVEN in these times. They will write you UP about anything and everything. If you make a mistake, they will look for a reason to let you go. Trust Me...no matter how well you do your job, it's not good enough for certain executives. The worst thing is how the management treats you, and the things they say to you. I could go on and on - but if you're thinking of working for this company - DON'T DO IT! unless you love hating to go to work everyday - Love managers who love (literally) to make you miserable, love management who threaten to fire people every day (and do) etc, etc. If you LOVE micro management, you'll thrive here."
bad,"Provided excellent training and benefits, very professional and diverse.management team. Worked in 3 divisions in the mortgage industry, centralized, retail and private mortgage banking. If the layoffs werent imminent, I would still work here."
bad,Management that I worked with was racial. I was put on bed rest my entire pregnancy. I had a pic line in for nutrition and was being fed through this and kept in touch with them every two weeks when I had my doctors appointment. They filled my job a month before I was to delivered.
bad,"Within Wells Fargo there is  a very strong undercurrent of ""do not think for yourself"" do it the Wells way. This breeds a level of incompetence and laziness within all levels of leadership."
bad,Job is very high stress & under paid when you are answering the phone & writing letters for the CEO & VP's.  Rules change every day and there is not consistency.
bad,"This is a terrible place to work. The money is what appealed to me. But unless you can handle very extreme sales this is not an ideal job. You get written up if you don't meet your daily sales goals. And humiliated in front of everyone. Once or twice a week, you have to stay an hour or two after the branch closes to make sales calls. If you don't have 2-4 appts set for the next day you have to stay till you do. Breaks? You want a lunch break? You want your ten minute breaks? Forget it! If there are customers waiting you help them, breaks come last. If you aren't helping customers you and standing behind the tellers making conversations with customers, or making sales calls. There are a lot of cliques and if you aren't part of them you will not enjoy this job. They have a very high turnover rate because no one can handle this job for very long. Oh, and you have to spend 5 weeks in Portland for training. Have a family? Say goodbye for those 5 weeks. WORST PLACE EVER TO WORK."
bad,Everyone wanted to tell you how to do the job. Everyone wanted to be a boss. Not a good place to work. Did not have a break while I worked their only had a 30 Min. break for lunch and that was it. Could not wait to get off work.
bad,"Maintains comprehensive knowledge of the bank's products, services and credit standards in commercial & consumer banking pricing.

bad,Personal Banker at Wellsfargo Bank deal with high value customers in the sales department.
bad,If you like sales and doing whats best for the company not the customer this is the job for you
bad,Answering emails and extending rates explaining to customers why they have not closed and what their status is.
bad,Wells fargo financial was a very exciting and fullfilling place and corp. to work for with excellent benefits and opportunities to advance.I loved my career with them.
bad,"If I had my choice over again I would not go to work for Wells Fargo. I had a couple of offers from banks and made the mistake of taking the job at Wells Fargo thinking it would be a professional environment. Maybe I have just had a bad experience in the branch and district that I work in, but the management, from low to high is TERRIBLE!! They don't even try to PRETEND to act like they are concerned with your well being....its all about the numbers...the way THEY look to their superiors...you might as well be a robot working at this place. The sales manager at my branch would be best suited in a career as a kindergarten teacher....its ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. You are not allowed to express an opinion or suggest anything. She talks to you like your 2 years old right in front of the customers. If you ask a question about something you are unclear on they will always answer your question with this question... ""didn't you go to teller training?""....because most of the time THEY DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER. Management plays favorites....much like a TEACHERS PET. Personally in my experience it has been a down grade for my career. I am currently seeking other opportunities. I am much smarter than this...don't sell yourself short on this place because MOST of us are!"
bad,No respect for employees or customers.
bad,I worked very hard for this company and right from the training class i started being the best performer even beating the veterans.
bad,"At first, I was so excited about the possibilties this company had offered to me. It was a great work environment and I truly felt respected not only on an employee level, but at a personal level as well. I had to transfer to another branch, in another state and once I got there it was all downhill. It was the worst work experience of my life and I worked at McDonalds once. I was with Wachovia/Wells Fargo for 5 years, one year being at the new location and it put such a sour taste in my mouth. Not only was the merge from Wachovia to Wells Fargo HORRIBLE, but I never felt so underappreciated. I will not recommend this place to anyone."
bad,Cares more about themselves than the customer. Management is not concerned about their workers-just about their paychecks
bad,The people are great and fun to work with it is just the managers that do not know how to manage.
bad,To much micro managing. Dealing with others money can get annoying. Customers want money managers and not customer service.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"opening accounts and servicing clients, managment was not that great , kept changing management every other month, had great co-workers worked as a teamwork at all the time , hardest part of the job dealing with new managers showing them how the branch worked"
bad,"Wachovia was only worth working for because of all of my customers I had gotten to know. The managers there were very disrespectful to fellow employees; felt they could talk to you anyway they wanted to and if you didn't like it, they threatened you with your job. Part of the job was selling bank products, which I had no problem doing, and at times was very good at it; but the compnay wanted us to sell products that were unnecessary to customers, just so the company could make some money. And if you didn't meet weekly sales goals, you got written up. The job was only worth going to so I could assist my customers and do the best I could to assist them."
bad,"The typical job itself can be stressful, but that's part of working in banking and mortgage. The problem with Wells Fargo is not the work, but rather the people, and more specifically within the Default area. The constant pre-school antics mixed with a mentality of ""Management is right, and employee doesn't matter"" has taken a serious toll on people. My department has seen a LARGE number of people leaving to find positions elsewhere, either within the company or externally."
bad,Meeting that are goal orientated. Management is not consistent. Co-workers are stressed and afraid for their job. Customers are wonderful. Products are and services offered are also benificial when applied properly.
bad,"I have been working at Wells Fargo for three years and have worked toward excellence the entire time. Wells Fargo Laid me off due to a Criminal citation that I received 8 years before I started there. Now after 3 years they are changing their ""policy"" and are Mass laying off hardworking employees for no reason."
bad,I hated working at this company this Call center environment . Very Ghetto and Messy the supervisors where. People all in your business. They couldn't have done a better move but to lay me off.
bad,Stay away from Mitchell bridge (Athens GA)... it has the worst management team. They dont pay enough either
bad,I worked here and was pressured to mislead customers by management.
bad,Didnt like working there. Only stayed bc of how much I made. The managers I had as a banker were terrible and once was written up for not wearing makeup to work.
bad,"Unless you are in a senior position they don't seem to care about you, pay is low and benefits are enough. Most positions don't require much critical thinking and are production based, and all management cares about is the numbers."
bad,"Wells Fargo is a great job to practice and build on your skill set."
bad,"This is the most stressful job I’ve ever had. The work load is way too high for the pay that is given and the managers only care about the numbers. Things change on a day to day basis, but there is no one there to help you learn how to execute the changes. But it is expected that you do it correctly, even though you were never trained!!!"
bad,"This is a typical call center position. It is not managed well and the company itself has many challenges it needs to overcome. If you are okay with taking call after call, speaking often to angry customers who fall through the many gaps this job is for you."
bad,"Favoritism is a big problem there. During training you have to pass a few tests and if you don’t pass you loose your job or as I have found out, there have been a few employees who didn’t pass the tests and still got to continue working there. Taking tests is NOT a good judgment of how well a person can do on the job. They treated me badly. They have bad company practices!!!!!"
bad,"The managers at Wells dont know how to manage, they lack managerial skills themselves and they dont even know the job in which they are over so they cant provide necessary feedback. No work life balance, they expect you to not have a life, to always be at work reguardless of lifes moments."
bad,"I learned that I really don't want to work there, as the culture is mostly toxic.  Affirmative action is still a thing there. Contractors seem to be hired solely for the purpose of having people around who can legally be abused and blamed for management's inability or unwillingness to make decisions.  Just keep swabbing the deck, don't ask questions or you too, will be overboard.  Once they overspend, they start looking for ways to reduce head count."
bad,"My direct boss was a pleasure to work for, however, she was mandated by her boss (who admitted she didn't even want to be in our division of the bank) to do things that made me feel icky as a professional salesperson."
bad,"Too big. Questionable business practices. Additionally, I was tasked with responsibilities that others classified higher than me and paid much more than me were doing, but was denied advancement."
bad,Some IT roles have incredibly long hours. There is almost no work life balance. There is a culture of always being tethered to a device so you can be reach at almost all times.
bad,"Horrible the way leadership speaks about their direct reports. Nothing is kept confidential or private whatseoever. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Some of the supervisors have attitudes because there have been so much turn over and demotions they hold grudges and illwill toward the company they take out on the underlings.
bad,The team was set on exploiting me as an employee to further their careers.  Management pulled me aside to make me feel guilty so they wouldn't be reported.
bad,Goals goals goals.  Poor tech support. Have to speak to someone in India after holding for 20 minutes while customers are at your desk  management treats the tellers like dirt and bankers are pressed to sell.  Ethics are non existent   Upper management has no clue as to “boots on the ground” experiences. Run for the hills this company is full of hypocrisy
bad,"Even after the scandals, my opinion is that they still have poor technology leadership, management and employees that behave in an unprofessional manner. This IS my day to day work life. Yes, I've escalated and complained ALL the way up the chain, and I'm a high performing employee. Yet nothing has changed in the time since I reported it. The only redeeming quality of working at Wells Fargo WAS the ability to telecommute which is why I gave work/life balance a 5. However, they are pulling telecommute in lieu of putting people in 5-7? (number keeps changing) large work ""hub"" campuses they call ""Location Strategy"". Another poor ""human capital"" decision by Wells Fargo. The reward for those who did nothing wrong and stuck with them? Layoffs or an ask to uproot your entire family to support a flailing company with no CEO (as of today). Way to go Wells Fargo!"
bad,Wells Fargo had potential to be a great company. The only issue I had was the was I was treated. I know that I was not liked as I did not fit in to the “Wells Fargo” culture. I spoke my mind and managed top teams but I did not socialize with my peers as I was focused on my teams. That did not go over well with my managers and ultimately made for my demise with the company.
bad,Would not work there again as they do not retain staff. Job security is horrible. Work you to the max; should not pay for meals-provide bonus instead.
bad,There's a reason the turnover rate is so high. When going to management about issues they don't do anything to help you.They are only looking out for themselves.Just a lot of drama. Like being in high school again.
bad,"If you just want to make money and be ignored then this is the place for you."
bad,This is a place where you are not judge by your skills and knowledge for advancement but who you know. There are people there who have been there for 15-20+ years and are good at what they do but are never given a well deserved title. But someone who is a relative of a management can be hired on for a higher title without any knowledge/experience in the field. That leaves many loyal and hardworking employee feeling neglected and unappreciated.
bad,"When you are trained they tell you that no one can into your draw or process transaction on your computer and that is the first thing that they do to you. There is an extreme lack of training, teller go to training for 2 weeks come into the branch and instead of the management proceeding the training they throw the job to the working tellers. They always say your opinion matter but in reality it never does, when you state a problem that is going on things just get worst instead of better so the employees rather keep shut."
bad,"Overall, I learned a great deal at Wells Fargo and build up a great amount of experiences. The pay it great. Still today unethical practices are happening and management is pushing employees out who raise his or her hands. If you are okay with getting paid well, but never know when you will have a job Wells Fargo is a great start. I would make note Wells Fargo is still going to reduce staff by up to 10% over the next 3-5 years, which means you may be hired and then let go or worse fired for no reason. "
bad,"Honestly I only stuck it out here for the money, the pay is really good (starting wage $15) but I'd only recommend it as a last resort. Bonus metrics change constantly because they're trying to make it more difficult to bonus and you're reliant on other people's metrics to be able to get yours. For me the job was detrimental to my mental health, abusive calls all day really wear on a person. Also when you start out you're on split weekends for minimum 90 days, that makes it difficult to actually be able to recuperate on your days off. Management is eh depending on who you get. The only good thing is that most of the teammates I had were really cool people. Overall though, the company is garbage, and as a result customers take it out on bankers."
bad,Never acknowledged for achievements. No work and family balance. High turn-over rate due to lack of teamwork and no clear goal in mind. Was hired as an Operational risk consultant and treated more like a personal secretary.
bad,"Lack Management, lack professionalism and promises not carried out "
bad,"I started working for Wells Fargo in Aug. of 2017 , started in collections and moved to their funding department. I wish i would have stayed where i was. The collections culture was very ""crabs in a barrel"" however you were able to make more money and plenty of overtime, however in funding its a dead end job. They don't pay well at all and have been overloading everyone with work due to their very high turn over. They play favorites and tend to forget a lot of things when its not in writing. If you've been out of work for a while and are looking for something quick then maybe i would apply here but if you want to grow and make money this is not the position or company for you."
bad,"Literally the worst work experience of my life.  The corruption throughout wellsfargo is pervasive through all levels,  completely devoid of business and social ethics."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"I was employed during the ""checking Sales"" period with Wells Fargo so this review may be unfair. Customer Service was non existent or only lasted for as long as a sale could be generated. Management would direct walk in sales to only a select few employees and were transparent in their favoritism. As well, Management would direct research, notaries and various other time consuming activities to impede another employee's success."
bad,"Very busy/fast pace job. In the beginning it’s hard but once you get the hang of it, it becomes easy! You can really grow as a teller here. Some management if you get lucky at a certain branch will help you get promoted which is nice. The hardest part about the job is selling to the customers but once you get comfortable with selling it becomes easy"
bad,This place is cut throat. I worked for Wells Fargo for over 15 years and made one mistake and was let go. There were a lot of people doing deceitful practices but was never corrected.
bad,Scamming company that will do anything to meet their goals.  Harassing customers on a daily basis about products they already politely declined because there isn't a need for it.
bad,I rather not disclose a review on this company just for personal reasons and my protection. I experience a situation that is currently under review and I'm disputing the issue just for my personal situation.
bad,"The pros:"
bad,"A typical day is coming into an insane pipeline with no work life balance and no room for promotion, management was lacked professionalism and there were no set guidelines on how promotion could be accomplished."
bad,Worked on computer 8 hours per day completing daily tasks. Learned more about personal property violation processing. Culture of workplace is currently streamlining processes having one person complete tasks vs. 2-3 people. There is no opportunity to be hired for full time employee status within company while being positioned as a contractor. Enjoyed working with coworkers and learning from them and management staff.
bad,"My manager wanted me to convince a customer to refinance a loan.  The new loan would have had a higher interest rate. "
bad,"The doors never stopped revolving with new employees coming in and current employees leaving the company just as quickly. "
bad,"Wells Fargo has been in the news for its crooked business, and internally it's no better. Constantly letting people go in masses with little or no warning. Managers, coaches, temps, full teams all gone due to needs of the business. It's happened multiple times this year and it creates a stressful work environment. If you are able to stay then there are some great opportunities, but you can lose it at any time. I will say I loved my coworkers and my sups. Some things are out of their hands unfortunately."
bad,"The salary and benefits were good, but the demand for production was very stressful on marriage and family. In order to work at being a Closer at Wells Fargo and being successful outside of a career would mean you should not have a family as you are always busy and the time spent at work is stressful."
bad,If you don't mind a very slow pace and no advancement. If you are ok with doing the same things everyday and knowing that it will be the same tomorrow. If you just want a job and not a career. Then this might be the place for you.
bad,"Worked regular 8 hour shifts, learned how to resolve issues with customers and retain business. Workplace culture was good and fun with lots of incentives and management was organized and well informed and promoted advancement. Hardest part of the job was working till 9p followed by a 7a shift."
bad,"Run poorly, and the people in management roles were not knowledgeable for the type of roles they held. VERY low pay & in no way could be sustainable with one income. It was the type of place where if you paid your dues in the length of time you were there you would inevitably be given a promotion, regardless of whether or not you were the best person for the job. If someone was there more years than you, you were guaranteed to have to wait until another promotion came available if it wasn't your turn. It doesn't matter how hard you work, you NEVER skip a position, you just have to wait your turn. AND if you took the position offered (even when the difference in pay wasn't even 5% more than what you previously were making) you had to stay in that position for a full year before you could apply for another promotion or a job in a different department. It just always seemed like you would be at a standstill no matter how hard you worked."
bad,"Not happy with human resources even if you reported wrong doing they did not do anything about it, the working hours are too much and they do not want to pay overtime, sales pressure was horrible."
bad,"Didn't feel appreciated for all my hard work. It was never enough and the always wanted more. "
bad,"that should explain it.  Don't go work in call center environment.  mngrs do make or break it and the mngt team leaves a lot to be desired"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,High stress and high turnover. Pretty much sink or swim when it comes to ability of cross selling products and services. Their reputation of profits before people has now come back to hurt them as it should.
bad,Wells Fargo was a company that seemed not to care for its employees or its customers. The pay was low and advancement opportunities took a very long time to achieve. But the worst part was the lack of opportunity that was provided by the company/managers.
bad,"Management is incompetent.  Morale is extremely low among employees.  Inconsistent rules, unattainable goals for production.  Scandal and corruption run rampant at the top of Wells Fargo."
bad,"Working at Wells Fargo was beneficial in terms of knowledge gained.  The managers are just doing their job to get the employees to make their "" goals"" but stress levels are high if you are having issue bringing in new business."
bad,"Terrible environment in every way, especially for a manager -- constant calling in to report activities and successes, no tolerance for out-of the-box thinking, must follow ridiculous scripts"
bad,"If you find forcing people into debt through lies and deception is your forte, then this is you calling. I wish I was exaggerating. Just check out the Yelp Reviews to get a glimpse."
bad,"If you want to work for a horrible place, Wells Fargo is it. They are more concerned with profit than integrity. The people that work there, minus upper management, are horrible."
bad,Banking industry job.  Monday thru Saturday work hours. After hours calling customers to set up new accounts. Developing sales skill similar to car sales
bad,I worked there for 2 years and within the Banker Connection portion there was no room for advancement and you were stuck within that position no matter what other openings were in other areas of the company.
bad,"Aside from the fact that the company is a walking ethics violation, they will definitely take advantage of you and your contributions. It doesn't matter if you go above and beyond every day, you won't be recognized by management and you'll still get paid the same amount as the person napping at their desk right next to you."
bad,"A typical normal workday was usually filled with investigating customer issues pertaining to potential fraudulent activity. In the event fraud was found, further analysis and research was conducted to ensure the protection of the customer and the apprehension of the person of interest associated with the activity. "
bad,"A day in the life at WF was a cube life. "
bad,Terrible upper management. There were very few managers; at most 2; that genuinely cared about the ethics of the company as well as how to keep employees motivated and eager to succeed. Other than the couple managers there was nothing but favoritism and knowledge was not required in a business that is FEDERALLY REGULATED.
bad,Can only speak to the Investment Banking part of the house. I was in a coverage group in New York City and the hours were awful. 90+ hours a week normally with a tyrant and poor head of the group. He set the tone for everything. 17 people left in a matter of a month. I believe largely because of him.
bad,"Wells Fargo Dealer Services is a very happy place to work, my fellow employees make it fun to go to work. The Management is not trained for the job at hand and are hired from other parts of collections and are not well versed in the car side of collections. The hardest part of the job is not getting a straight answer for the questions that you have and it is really hard to do your job with out having all the tools you need to get the job done."
bad,stressful in sales and no room to move up. bad attitudes and teamwork environment. if you had any complaints they did nothing about them. They have their favorites at work.
bad,not much to say here. wells fargo hires and lays employees off without any regard for the human component of their actions.  their decisions are always financially based.
bad,"If you are in the wrong place, bam...  you are gone."
bad,"Wells Fargo had very weak management. I was there in 2013 - 2014 when they tried to transition from specialized product and underwriting teams to every team member had to be an expert on all products and systems. They had 2 legacy AS-400 operating systems (LPS & LSI) plus a new windows based operating system (CORE) and were operating all 3 at the same time. The training and support for CORE was terrible with SME's  (Subject Matter Experts) designated to be able to provide training and support, but the SME's didn't know much more about the problems in CORE than we did as we tried to underwrite with it. It was a mess. They had too many managers who were more like figureheads and cheerleaders than anything else. Its a large bureaucracy that needs to be overhauled."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,very fun Business Place great workers team players just being a temp job would have loved to stay seem like they would have had good package plans but being a temp I was unable to see
bad,"I had a pretty good job at Wells Fargo, but on November 1, 2017 they closed our call center and over 460 employees lost their jobs. We were not offered any positions within Wells Fargo & Co."
bad,"Watch a turn around rate that was absolutely insane while I worked for the company. People constant being fired for not being sales goals for the day. On slow days our manager would send employees out to ""sell"" to places around the building, IE, sending our Spanish speaking teller out to harass the construction workers down the street into opening accounts in order to hit quotas, or opening fake attachments and accounts for relatives."
bad,The pay was competitive and benefits were good. The management and supervisors were hard to work for. The position was not based on your skills but popularity.
bad,The culture is toxic and out of touch. Pay is low and management opportunities depend on how much one can flatter other management and play the game. Most employees experience tremendous stress that effects their home lives.
bad,"The Richmond VA call center of Wells Fargo Bank is a poorly run office of a poorly run division of a poorly run company."
bad,I was working there on a temp position and once the work was done they cut every employee they were just trying to get through the busy time. I did not enjoy the work it was not what I was told it was going to be. It was customer service and not sales.
bad,"You're not really considered a human being when you work at Wells Fargo. This is a place that will fire you right after your mom dies. I've seen that exact scenario happen. It was extremely disturbing. They'll also try to get an employee to pay them back for already approved and taken vacation after firing them. It's as if the place is full of vindictive lizards who pretend to have actual human emotions in order to get what they want from people.After they get what they want, watch out."
bad,I use to love my job but since new management I hate it. There is no advance for African Americans within my department. There is a lot of favoritism shown to certain individuals and they are the ones that get the advancements.
bad,The first 3 yrs I like working here but the last 2 have been horrible and stressful...I hate the favoritism that's been shown here when there should be NONE! Since a month after I started working here I let ot be known that I was interested in moving up in the company...I been here going on 5 years and still in the same position because now I know it's about who the manager wants in a particular position verses on a person that has strived hard to work on any areas that needed to be worked on and still in thesame place!
bad,"Very low pay and over 80% customer service, it's not a Financial Advisor positon, it's a customer service position at a call center. Most  days are spent calling out to clients with very small accounts to review their  portfolios and resolve any complaints they might  have."
bad,"working at Wachovia was goal driven, and cut throat.  It was a terrible environment to work in , goals always changing and upper management was no interested in employees"
bad,Fast paced. Things get done in a timely manner. Overbearing management. Diverse culture. Hardest part was management and the way things were handled and the most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
bad,"Team members there are awesome, they are knowledgeable and very helpful. Unfortunately the managers there aren't. They are negative and thrives off fear. They always make the employees feel like they're going to loose their jobs. I've seen them promote unqualified and unknowledgeable and dismiss the helpful, knowledgeable and concerned employees. They continuously go through contractors month after month.  The post funding position is continually posted every month.  It's not the contractors it's management. Be ware if you apply for that position don't look to be there no more than a month."
bad,"A good place to work if you are willing to work with contradictions of ethics and ready to be cut throat. Very difficult place to work if you can't deal with sales, especially in a small town or a high business area where you don't have a steady flow of new customers."
bad,"Not for the faint of heart. Sales was the number one focus for everyone. Everyone was nice to work with, but the sales always made for a stressful environment."
bad,very little communication for the lowest tier of employees. the stronger the bottom is of a company the easier it is to support the rest of the higher ups. however they felt differently and did not seem to care about me or my peers in my same level of employment.
bad,"The management plays favorites and pretends they care about you but then when you need them they act like you are bothering them. They are never there for customer issues and then get upset when you resolve them yourselves. They constantly micromanage and only decided to hold specific people accountable. Management needs better training and needs to stick to their schedule. They should not be able to come and go as they please and not take responsibility for anything that happens at their branch. I was used a scapegoat, isolated, and ignored. It is not a healthy working environment and the staff does not care for each other. I would never recommend this as a company someone should work for."
bad,the only thing they care about is sales and lying to customers so they can get a credit card or a new checking/saving account that they really dont need.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Ar first i thought this was a great place to work until it became evident that it was more sales driven than actually helping individuals out financially.
bad,The people I work with are wonderful.  Wells Fargo management does not value it's employees.  The raises are non-existent even after winning multiple awards
bad,"center was shut down shortly after i started, when questioned management about our future was told a smoke screen, work was good while it lasted"
bad,"I bank at chase now. "
bad,not happy with management. They do not work with you in advancement. Also hounding down your throat to sell more no matter what the cost. I do not agree with lying to get my ways. I am very honest and hence my reasoning to leaving this company.
bad,I absolutely hated working at wells Fargo Home Mortgage. There was a lack in training (if any) and the people were very rude. A lot of temps coming in and out. Not a healthy environment
bad,"Don't work here. The culture is off from what they make you hear. They will suck you dry, no work life balance, management is on a power trip(I am a assistant manager myself)"
bad,I provided technical support for the financial advisors (brokers) at wellfargo and I will say that they are as rude as they come.  I survived a whole year working there but it was not easy.  Please reconsider working for that department.
bad,Always wanting you to sale things to customers that don't need it. always changing in staff. Managers are pushy and uncaring about family.
bad,"People are not treated well here."
bad,"Arrived each morning to a very small cubicle and put on a headset to begin making calls to customers and potential customers.  By working for this company, I learned that I was not meant to sit in a cubicle with little interaction with the outside world.   The management was horrible and had very unethical ways of handling his business."
bad,"Don't get me wrong, the pay is great. I started out as a temp making $10.50/hour and when I was ""displaced"" along with the rest of my department I was making over $16. I was there for three years. I will say when we all got notice that our department was closing, most of us had been there long enough to get severance and unemployment. While I was there I had 5 different managers. Most of the management team I experienced did not know how to be managers. The buck was always being passed to the ""higher up"" manager. It was very hard to get your voice heard when you HAD concerns about your manager. The managers manager acted like we were bottom feeders and management of any kind was ALWAYS right."
bad,"Great conversation with customers, everyone laughing and the customer could be so thankful, but if you didn't pitch a sale you would be question as to why.  The whole company evolves around sales.  This company has been headlined in magazines for being notorious about sales and getting people to sign up for things they didn't want or need.  I've seen it first hand.  I've seen managers tell customers their new account came with a credit card which it didn't just to get extra sales proxy.  It's a shame this company has worked its way to the top this way.  It will catch up with them.  In the mean time I'll sit back and get my little check until something better comes along."
bad,Poor management that encourages team to do unfair activities to get sales quotas. Upper management is so sales driven that customer service doesn't matter to this company.
bad,"calls to new customers, greet all customers as they enter the bank, open new accounts, refer other clients to financial specialists, manage tellers, schedules, reviews, etc"
bad,managers are lazy and dont give any attention unless you do something bad. the training doesnt prepare you for any of the actual problems that happen in the workplace. they tell you they want you to do well but dont care at all. they do not tell you when any updates happen or policy changes which causes confusion and angry customers.
bad,"I enjoyed working as a teller for this company however I don't like how you cant advance within no matter how hard you try and too many sales requirements,"
bad,Great benefit plan. room for growth. not the place for you if not interested in sales. sales are the main focus not what is right for the customer but how many numbers you can get
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Let me begin by stating CLEARLY that WF is a BIG company, and each employee's experience is mostly influenced by its leadership stack (more and more as you move from the top TO your level.  So your manager, and your manager's manager are probably the two LARGEST contributors to your experience there (which would explain why there are so many different opinions on what it is like to work there... but IF you can show up consistently for 30 to 40 hours a week and aren't seeking personal fulfillment in your work, then you stand the very real change of making VERY GOOD money!  (and that is the most honest ""high level"" feedback I can give...)"
bad,I did not like this job at all! It was very sales demanding and the managers did not talk to you professionally! All they cared about was you meeting your numbers and did not look at you like a person but a body to make sales!
bad,They treat you like cattle.  It's a good way to get experience and eventually move to a better company.  The people you work with are good and your direct supervisor.  Upper level management sucks.
bad,"dont work there.  It is a sweat shop and no good anymore,  they dont do well by there employees"
bad,"Working here was a bit stressful because of the highly unrealistic sales goals but it was tolerable...up until our old manager found work else where. Then I saw how shady the company was because the new manager was willing to break the sales code of ethics to get sales. However, when it came down to it instead of taking the fall for it, the new managers threw the entire original staff under the bus, got all of us fired making her free to bring in all of their own people from their old branches. Like I said, it was stressful but I actually liked working here until our old, amazing manager left. The higher ups at this company have no idea what they're doing. I really don't understand how Wells is still in business."
bad,out bound call center setting collecting payments on customers accounts. collection department
bad,"Great Pay! Was really slow so most of us were laid-off!"
bad,Dialing out and receiving inbound calls dealing with delinquent home mortgage accounts. Solving issues with payments and or getting them to the proper department.
bad,"I took this job under the assumption that this was just another customer service job, Oh how wrong I was! Wells Fargo is nothing like it's predesessor Wachovia not only regarding customer service but also the products and services they offer. Bottom line is this you are supposed to believe you are there to provide top notch customer service and refer products that may benefit the customer....NO!!! This company does not care about the customers but only increasing it's profits at all costs and pushing customers into products they do NOT need and do NOT benefit them. Typical days consists of taking calls from customers regarding checking/saving accounts etc, however the difference here is that unless you are pushing any and all available products on customers on EVERY call regardless of the situation including fraud and system outages you are not doing your job.Ex...my house was just burglarized...well let me tell you about our CD rates.. Not only are you harassed hourly regarding your numbers but Team leads/Supervisors will plug in every opportunity""every 5 minutes"" to provide you ""coaching"" because regardless of the service you are providing, if your numbers are not meeting expectations on a hourly basis something is very wrong. I have never been in a more stressful environment and had so many co-workers feel exactly the same way. I have never worked for a company that in the opening of a call you are required to inform them you will be suggesting other products/services before you even begin to service the need of the call. Training made it seem completely the opposite, they"
bad,although overall company is great this division was not prepared
bad,Wells Fargo position was a temporary assignment through Accountemps Staffing Service.  I have learned many new skills.
bad,It was always understaffed and management was horrible! And it was always about selling things to customers that they didn't need and if you didn't you would be fired! And even if you work hard they didn't care. I did the love paid time off you got and also the benefits.
bad,"Assisting customers with online banking issues. The company still has a lot of growing to do. I have great co workers, which makes the job more fascinating!"
bad,very bad management don't ever call in or you will be fired even if your kids are sick.
bad,"Significant room for advancements, friendly positive staff. A lot of multitasking necessary and quite high paced"
bad,"Poor management, absolutely no understanding towards personal needs, life situations, family, kids. Every attempt to communicate a time off (PTO), end with a write up. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"it was a strong company to work for but, advancement comes to a hault at a certain point. so your pay does too. benefits were good."
bad,"I am currently a personal banker at Wells Fargo. This job is all about sales, sales and more sales. The expected sales goals are very difficult to achieve creating a very stressful work environment. There is no team work among the other bankers. Wells Fargo motto of ""helping customers succeed financially"" is an absolute joke. I would not recommend working at Wells Fargo to anybody."
bad,"I'm afraid my review will not be a positive one for Wells Fargo. After becoming a valuable lead secretary in the legal department and working for this company for fifteen years, I developed a debilitating health condition which my doctor deemed required some medical leave from my job. I basically lost my job because I had been there too long and was making too much money. Wells Fargo was in the process of cutting back, including layoffs, and I had a new manager who was trying to look good to her new employer. She used technicalities that applied to all the personel but used them to end my career with Wells Fargo."
bad,All this business cares about is sales and making more and more money
bad,"Fail management, especially in FX operations department. Exclude,suppress the employees who hold different views. Compel seniors employees to work excess without pay."
bad,"Interaction with internal and external customers; gathering due diligence items for loan approvals; obtained valuable knowledge of real estate, various laws as they pertain to real estate and other issues; most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with a great group of co-workers. Hardest part of the job was the high level of stress"
bad,constant layoffs- no structure- low pay- best part was the people that worked there. location was a plus.  Would not work for them again due to all the layofs
bad,"This particular place is a very stressful place to work.  Certain individuals made it worse.  I feel the training is insufficient.  Another thing is that certain individuals in higher rolls are unprofessional, and broadcast information about employees that should be private."
bad,"The people I worked with were very nice. I worked at 2 branches during my training time there, which is not the norm. I believe this hindered my performance"
bad,Not a great place to work. force to push products for customers no room to move up management at branch level decent but the district manager was horrible
bad,"Make sure you are open minded, know what you want. Also make sure you understand what you have  applied for. Different shifts and pretty good benefits"
bad,The job is not what i thought (or told) what it was supposed to be.  Manager is suffocating and adds stress daily; does not shield direct reports from his own stress and chaos.
bad,Nothing is consistent but change. Everyone comes in with the same schedule and it takes almost 2 years to win a bid for a better schedule. Employees always complain making the environment even more stressful. Trading sucked!
bad,"The group is massively disorganized to the point that it sets employees up for failure. High performance standards ends up causing negative impact to customers and employees. Upper management constantly is contradicting itself as well as it's own written policy. Further, updating policy is near impossible so written policy cannot keep up with business needs. Claims to be customer and employee oriented but those are just falsehoods said to make the company look good on paper."
bad,"Loved this place until they fired me after having accommodations (FMLA) set up. They horror stories about the bank itself, is the same thing for being employed there."
bad,"Wells Fargo is not a great place to work! They management shows favoritism and if you have a job related issue, don’t bother taking it to HR! They all work together!"
bad,NO stability. No loyalty. Very cut-throat environment. There seems to be little or no forward thinking / consideration regarding the employees. Many questionable actions.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"If you are looking for a healthy & stable  place to work, stay away. Right now this company is in total chaos. The feds have a noose around it’s neck and it’s tightening more every day."
bad,Very unprofessional place to work. I will never work with them again. The trainer was very sarcastic. It’s a dog eat dog kind of world. If you have a question in training? The trainer makes fun of you.
bad,"It started out great very happy with my co workers and super friendly customers . Then four month down the road management started getting unprofessional, I got in trouble for one of my shirts apparently it want professional enough , also they get you in trouble for everything, also they pick favorites. The bankers will go into your drawer and start selling without you knowing and are very unprofessional. Don’t work at the mill plain location."
bad,"Tons of pressure to sale ""sticky products"". If you didn't sale products, you were put on a performance improvement plan. If you did do well in the ""sales"", you would not get very much compensation."
bad,Wells Fargo had to close most small community banks. Worked in a small community and there were too many banks. Wachovia had banks that Wells Fargo took over that could not be kept open.
bad,Management is manipulating and only work by the book when it’s convenient to them. Management have clicks and favorites. Leadership as a whole is garbage.
bad,"Wells Fargo is the Walmart of Banking. Low wages and deaf eared management. "
bad,Moral is down. Micromanage x10. Don’t care about their employees mental health. No advancement due to favoritism. It’s difficult because it can be a great company but it’s going down hill. They need to appreciate their team members more.
bad,"This was by far the worst place I have ever worked.  The higher management is only concerned with numbers and not how they are gained, even at the customers expense."
bad,It's a company that steps on their internal and external customers to make money. They are greedy and they are thieves. I would never recommend them to anyone for any future employment or to be their financial institution.
bad,"South lakeline was my home location and I absolutely did not like working there it was a stressful environment, the management didn’t like me and it showed. You definitely will be micromanaged at this location, the managers will literally stand shoulder to shoulder with you. Everything tellers did became a problem. Water in bottles even became a problem and don’t dare try and read a book. Many times management talked about my look and how I looked but no customer ever complained about me coming of rude or mistreating them. The branch manager definitely had more respect for the tellers who were a little older in age on many occasions the branch manager was rude to the younger lead teller than the one who was a little older. For these reasons applied to many other branches until I was finally able to move. I love the company and some of the other locations I worked but would prefer to never work with the people I worked with at South Lakeline."
bad,Corporate culture with no manager that can make a decision on their own.  Managers show an unwillingness to listen to their staff.  Working from home is an option but too many restrictions
bad,"Was not happy with wells too caddy of a workplace thats supposed to be professional work place , good managment but wouldn't suggest for other people to start career"
bad,"Wells Fargo rewards the hucksters and liars.  They place people who have no ethics in places of power, in hopes of defrauding customers and clients out of savings.  "
bad,"Things are probably different now, but when I worked for the company, it was sales above all else, even customer service. Nothing else mattered. A shame they had to buy out Wachovia, it was much better then."
bad,My manager was immature and disruptive and played favorites - she told me she spied on us all day waiting for us to make a mistake - she laughed loudly constantly and was very rude - she made the department feel scared to do anything
bad,"The compensation package is really what keeps most people, other than that the culture of the job is horrible. I'm literally only here because of the pay and benefits."
bad,"Third party only works on back end projects. It is not Wells Fargo, EGS Wells Fargo which means Employment Global Solutions. Do have direct banking like other banking organisation have. Only works on manual working on Insurance, Tax collections and other process which are no where related to banking."
bad,"When I worked there all they cared about was sales and meeting your sales goals. Nothing else mattered besides that. And ignoring a Cline treated you badly, even if you went back and realized it was false, it was always counted against you."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Aggressive sales goals and poor pricing are a really bad combination. I was not set up for success in this position and it became clear that my manager hires many people who leave within six months.
bad,"Good job, terrible company. I was fired in 2014 for questioning the aggressive sales and referral tactics. They got busted a while later, but folks like me are still not eligible for re-hire even though they admitted they were wrong."
bad,Management is extremely inconsistent in all manors. No job security. Would not recommend it to anyone. Their is no typical day. Every day policy change and expectations change
bad,Wells Fargo was an ok company to work for but it doesn't give a salary. It's all commission and you have to drive your own vehicle. If you do make a sale then the pay is good.
bad,"Worked at Wells for 15 years. Management focused on only pushing forward as many deals as possible. Catching branch representatives pushing deals forward after confirming fraud was troublesome when reported and ignored. Despite the current 'rebirth' the company is trying to show now, they already seem to be backsliding as myself and friends have reported them for opening accounts without permission."
bad,"The department I worked for actually closed. It was not a great place to work. Constant sales pressure, minimal opportunity for advancement, bad culture."
bad,it was just a mentally draining place to work at. Every word you spoke to a customer was scripted by management to manipulate the customer. & even after the whole WF scam the company leaned towards removing sale goals to customer service and that made it more scripting for the tellers. it was like being a robot.
bad,nothing nice to say after the lay off. I asked the New Manager to provide me with my own passwords since I was using three different employee ID and passwords which was against policy.
bad,I felt like having to meet quarterly sales and keep a wonderful customer service face and balance is to much duty for a 10.50 cents position. I feel like this job should pay more an hour due to the demands on the job duties.
bad,culture of care was lacking constantly contradicted themselves no real way to keep team accountable constant change or reprieve of corrective action clicks and favortisim
bad,Poor management skills.  Unconcerned about your personal life or health.  Would rather fire you then work with you to work part time due to medical issues.  Three surgeries in six months and they let me go.
bad,Certain managers were ok. Others were hateful and treated women like dirt. If you got pregnant some male managers would treat you poorly once they found out and would find ways to make your life stressful and let you know how your pregnancy was inconvenient to them and your job
bad,There is practically no growth beyond the branch level. Work can be fun at time but mostly stressful because of pressure on meeting unrealistic goals.
bad,My boss and her boss were both incompetent. They played favorites and made no effort to give positive feedback. It was horrible and I hated going to work everyday.
bad,"Ridiculous management. Borderline discriminative. Down your throat about sales and consistently making ""action plans"" to make you sell more forcefully."
bad,"their best days are behind them, they SAY that they have a company culture but it is just window dressing. They literally forced sales activities to push for new checking and savings accts, with no true regard for the actual customers NEEDS."
bad,"Overall it could have been better in all ways. "
bad,I was consistantley overworked and forced to stay past my shift for sometimes 30+minutes. The department is severley understaffed. No oppurtunity for advancement.
bad,I enjoyed the company while I was there. The banking hours were a huge plus. I enjoyed the customer interaction from day to day. I was able to become very knowledgeable of Banking products.
bad,"Poor management. My supervisor was pretty good. Work environment was terrible.I was harassed, body shamed and treated poorly by co-workers. People were sick all the time. Coughing and sneezing all the time. Had to start taking allergy medications to get through the day and week.. I would sneeze and cough for about 20-30 minutes after leaving everyday. This occurred during the day also. I wasn't able to do anything after work because I was exhausted from sneezing and coughing. I mentioned it to my supervisor and one day I saw a large number of the vents being replaced because of the amount of black soot that was built up on them and the tiles that surrounded them. After I quit, I did not have to take any medications and the symptoms subsided, ironically and thankfully. I have my health back. Great job if you have a child or  children for the health care benefits."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Great team and interesting projects but be prepared to work many hours for free. Job requires 50+ hours but max billable is 40. If your project requires air travel, this also tends to be on your own time. "
bad,Wells had no respect for their employees or their customers. What Wells was caught during and their admission of guilt was never true. The management mind set stayed the same.
bad,"Primary duties are to provide best services and information to Store Banker as a team we provide First Call Resolution and they provide great customer service s to Wells Fargo customers. I specialize in Loans and Official Bank Check.  Both Queues have High risk procedures that require close attention.   Daily I use system as MARS, OIB, Hogan, SVP, BC Home page, PAC, Nice, Soto, and cicso phone system and others"
bad,"Terrible sales pressure, management was terrible.  Lack of communication from Upper management to lower management.  The culture is terrible hence why they had over 2 million fake accounts"
bad,"Was okay with customer service. But when it came down to selling, it was not to good. After customer is already on hold over 20 minutes. They just want their answer and get off the phone."
bad,"In the time I was employed with Wells Fargo it was very stressful. You were required to make sales daily, sometimes they would keep you past your scheduled work day until you receive at least 3 sales."
bad,Management definitely had their favorites!!! All others were left to fend for themselves.  Training was very un-organized and handled poorly.  You’re constantly told you would lose your job if you don’t meet certain quota’s. They conference call you to death and it’s mandatory that you’re on all conference calls. And their conference calls are a total waste of time.  No one is actually  listening  or paying attention.
bad,This job is discussing problems customers are having with their accounts.   You have to have a complete knowledge of bank polices and procedures to inform people correctly.   You are expected to sell additional services to customers.   You are rated on your ability to sell the services.
bad,"Dishonest company, poor management, raises advancement with company based on production numbers not quality of work...hard company to advance with unless u want to kiss butt"
bad,"Antiquated and bureaucratic culture.  The company hires incompetent offshore contractors who work on non US time zones with little to no oversight.  Every request for infrastructure, software or assistance can take from days to weeks.  Nearly all communication is automated so you never if someone is working on your request, if it is progressing or who to contact if there is an issue.  Expect to spend most of you day doing paperwork.  Segregation of duties ensures at any given point, no one knows or cares about anything beyond the end of their system.  This can be an issue since systems are comprised of many systems supported by various teams who are dis-incentivized to work together."
bad,"Rude administrative assistants.  Extremely cold co-workers, especially if you are not a millennial.  Unorganized management and work processes, very unstructured for a department that is rating others on their adherence to standards.  Very inflexible about working from home."
bad,"At the time of working here they were pushing employees to meet unrealistic sales goals, leading us to sometimes go against our better judgement. if you were not meeting sales goals they would often hover over you and threaten job security, making you feel more like a sales man than a customer service representative. helping the customer almost seemed like it was last priority."
bad,"They lured candidates with bonus options, which were taken away after hire. Full job description was not disclosed to candidates. Toxic environment. Obligated to work one day of the weekend. Never told that it was a call center. If you are bilingual, you work harder than others for a 5% additional compensation, which is NOT worth the extra work!!!  Unprofessional, exploitation of employees.  Held to ridiculous quotas--one could detect fraud on someone's card, but if the card holder does not call it in, it's held negatively on your work--ridiculous!  Nepotism is rampant, so is favoritism. This was the worst job I have ever had and I only worked there 8 months, I couldn't wait to leave.  Wells Fargo Bank is a terrible place to work!"
bad,"The management was a mixed bag. I left as soon as I had the opportunity."
bad,"Managing to reports should never be your core metric in reviewing how your team is doing. especially when management is fudging the numbers."
bad,"Unable to maintain a good work life balance. Very hard as a single parent to work Mandatory overtime  during the week and on weekends. Constant Changes,  very unprofessional managers, very low moral. I would leave with stress migraine headaches daily that made me feel nausea. I don't know why i need to place a review of this horrible department. on this site. i worked for Wells for over 10 years, the last 6 months have been the absolute worst. I would prefer this not be published on the site."
bad,You have to do test cases and they don't tell you upfront that even if you pass test cases you still might let go if you have coach backs! The test case process is horrible.  It can take up to six months for the process and the training is not great.
bad,"Overly casual work environment, women have been seen wearing bath robes and slippers--not on Holiday- to work.  Management may where beach shoes and tees and baseball caps. Preference given to those who interview well--put on a show.  You do not need to know the job.  They will train you for what you need to know."
bad,"Wells Fargo has made changes to its severance policy that lower the amount it will pay out to most displaced employees, the bank informed workers on Monday."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Don't ever work for this Giant Finance Company.  They are like Rome and want to conquer the entire market.  They want to get so big that the government won't regulate them and watch their unethical business practices.  Managers a sales mongers and could care less of customer service.  You will hate yourself and your life if you choose to sell your soul to this Financial God.
bad,"This place is awful. Training was nonexistent. Managers are completely incompetent. Plus, managers spend most of their time in meetings instead of helping their team. Everything is micro-managed. Policies and procedures change every 5 mins. The only good things are pay/benefits and my co-workers are awesome."
bad,Working at Wells Fargo was one of the worst emotional experiences I have ever had not only are they diss honest and forced us to open a bank account and reasonably management was crooked shady and liars.
bad,"A non-agile environment still living with old processes that can hinder  delivery. The people in this department are bossy and really think contractors need to have a differential treatment. "
bad,"Tons of great people, tons of exciting projects to work on, fast paced with lots of opportunity.  Then the TARP thing and tons of layoffs and all of your friends start leaving or got promoted around you and the heart and soul of the job evaporated.  No matter which corner you turned to, you found mindless drones just putting in their day.  The best you could get was a neutral to no comment on how was your day.  You stopped asking because it would bring you down to hear it.  Then the managers would kick in, where were the defaults, the only ones left of the people who left, and they would come after you up to 5 times a day for sales goals with empty accounts.  Entry level positions would turnover quickly, professional positions would get paid well but be soul-less. Even sometimes mean with ploys to get people to quit. Managers pick their favorites and stick with their click and talk smack about anyone not in their click.  Miserable culture.  And, no-one dared complain then you would be black marked."
bad,Management was cold and uncaring when it came to issues of being sick or needing days off for family emergencies. It's a huge impersonal corporation.
bad,"Unrealistic sales/referral goals pressures employees to mislead customers into needless products.  The ""training portal"" is only for required compliance training, not for employee development.  They expect you to sell products without knowledge or training, but culturally they preach the game of skirting your lack of knowledge and tricks to answering objections. I was achieved these goals for two years by increasing my product knowledge during lunch and breaks, and analyzing calls to hone my craft, but in January of 2015, they handed out a document for all employees sign, advertising it as a renewal to our commitment to meeting sales goals, but we later discovered, that we signed an agreement to a change in the definition of trackable sales, a sheisty way of increasing the goal by hiking the eligibility, further exacerbating the issue of unrealistic goals.  For two years, I had achieved sales/referral numbers right way, but under the revised definitions that they tricked us into signing, I fell below goal.  I refused to do anything unethical, but eventually, I refused to deal with the pressure to be unethical, so I left the company in a way that didn't leave their door open for future employment.  I would never want to work for them again anyway."
bad,"Wells Fargo is all about the numbers.  People are like cattle, cultivated for a purpose and slaughtered as needed.  The company has no problem to bring in cheaper labor and even have you train them before letting you go, all in an HR-covered manner"
bad,Terrible place to work.  People come and go constantly.  They keep you in the retail bank environment and it's hard to transfer to other areas of the company.
bad,Management is very unprofessional. They create drama and like to inform the customers of personal information of other team members
bad,"I was only a Teller here for 3 and a half months; just long enough to find a better job! The sales quotas are ridiculous! Employees get desperate and start selling bank products to customers that don't really need them. It's slightly unethical. Managers are HAWKS and micromanage like crazy. You'll be asked at least once an hour about how many sales you've gotten for the day. If managers feel like you aren't selling enough, they'll stand over your shoulder and monitor every transaction you make. Work/life balance stinks. Days are long and breaks are short (if you get one!). The pay stinks as well. Overall, unless you're in college and need a part-time job for some extra cash, steer clear!"
bad,"It was a ok place to work, and the some of the staff was friendly. Manager was ok, very work driven for the rating for her department. I was not happy how they did not tell me my temp assignment had ended!"
bad,"Between the toxic atmosphere and the unattainable (unless you're soulless) goals, I almost had a nervous breakdown working here!"
bad,"The worst company to ever work for. Benefits were great, but works employees like a sweatshop."
bad,This company will single you out if you dont obey thier rules. You can follow the company policy but it only makes you a target for people insuring you dont come after thier jobs. I am the lead collector in this department and I train people to take it on the chin and not complain.
bad,"pron to discrimination, unthical challenges to deal with and no room for promotion"
bad,"work, eat sleep repeat. 7 days a week."
bad,"When I worked there, there was a tremendously talented pool of workers but no strong and knowledgeable management team to lead us.  We had the opportunity to work a lot of hours (unlimited) and we were paid extremely well.  But it was so frustrating to have managers who didn't invest themselves into their careers there and therefore, weren't invested in our success either."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Long hours and are forced to stand all day with one lunch brake. I was supposed to work only 30 hours a week and they would schedule me 32-40 hours a week without the benefits. Its a highly sales driven workplace to the point where it becomes unethical. Management changes the schedule last minute and doesn't inform you. You learn a lot about money, within the banking industry and how to balance large amounts of cash. All I ever heard were complaints from other employees. NOT a good place to work. "
bad,"Mortgage fraud is alive and well at this site.  Apparently if you're a big producer, a little fraud is tolerated.  Even worse, they will work you to death and spit you out.  They keep throwing money at their staff like a band-aid not realizing that at a certain point, no amount of money will help.  They do not care about your work/life balance and they don't care how many hours you put in.  As an underwriter, you are responsible for every piece of the file and are the only party held responsible.  You are the only person in the whole process who gets audited and are therefore the only person truly held accountable."
bad,I throughly did not enjoy working at Wells Fargo. I did not like financial retail. Most of the managers are not hard working people. There was a lot of gossip. I would not recommend it to anyone. If you want to work at a bank pick another bank.
bad,"As a teller you are expected to continuously cross sell products to a slimming group of customers. Each day you have a ""check in"" call at 11, 2, and 5 to report your daily numbers. If you are not up to their unrealistic expectations each time you are degraded on the conference call. You are bombarded daily with pointless emails detailing what is happening around the market. If you enjoy being acknowledged for doing a good job, this is not the place for you. I was named the top teller in Greater PA and received an email to invite me to a celebration lunch, but I deleted it because I wasn't aware I had done anything well."
bad,"General, I found that the organizational values that are expressed by this company in trainings and a a whole are not practiced by the individual branches. As a whole Wells Fargo is a good company. But seperated by branch and you find the usual bad stuff... manipulation of customers for personal financial gain by CSR's and bankers, not giving adaquate breaks and lunches by teller managers and covering up of work records to avoid consequences. Bad work environment all around... beware..!"
bad,"Take 100 calls per shift. Training class and floor operations not consistent. Customers call with lost/ stolen cards or claim ID theft many are lying due to being overdrawn on account. Company has some shady business practices even after federal fines! Calls need to be short or manager freaked out. When a customer wanted to give me a commendation, manager said give her voicemail number, but if a bad survey comes in look out. Bad call center environment, very clique oriented. Do not recommend at all."
bad,"If you are the type of person looking for a monotone job with a lot of downtime this is for you. If you see yourself as doing good in life, it is not."
bad,"""Stagecoach"" logo and theme matches their outdated mentality. I was part of a writing team that barely ever produced any new documentation. Managers were mortally afraid to change even one sentence in a document without having 10 managers review. Tons of paperwork around every change. Unstable department that reorgs way too often to be productive. Very antiquated and redundant processes. Employees who were happy to rat on others in order to advance their own career. Worst place I ever worked in my 25 years of working."
bad,It was a circus and quite apparent that nobody knew what they were doing there.  It was the worst culture (corrupt) I've ever been a part of and I can't believe contract firms would continue to feed them people.  Wells Fargo should be shut down.
bad,Extremely high stress.  Working there was a very toxic environment. Management only looked at customers as a way to make money not as humans.  Employees were seen as tools who should ignore their own ethics to get more money out of customers.    Goals were extremely high no flexibility when customer flow changed.
bad,"Maybe things are different but when I was there it was all about sales and forcing stuff on people. They didn't care about quality. I was a hard worker and made every phone call end happy, however, I did not push sales. Because of that they always threatened to fire me which I did not like. The interview they did not tell you all about the sales part. Made it seem like it was only about customer support. I'd prefer a Credit Union now."
bad,"Job depended on how many people we could convince to get an account that they probably didn't need or couldn't afford to have. Retail banking at it's worst. Complimented on how well we could talk customers into opening an account, insurance, direct deposit, checking or savings account etc. Found other employment in order to sleep better at night."
bad,Race and gender discrimination was a big issue at one of their branches.  After not feeling the equal opportunity to grow it was time to look at other companies that did not have the same limitations.
bad,"This company is a place when you hear the name, you feel somewhat accomplished to have worked there, until you're really working there. The things that go on behind closed doors are not ethical business practices. I left work feeling awful about the 'work' I provided. It's tough finding a decent manager to work under, and if you have one, STAY. I worked under several managers in several departments, and can honestly say there was 1 that I would choose to work under again. The others are not knowledgeable of the processes or procedures, or are complete jerks and do not make going to work enjoyable. Best of luck if you get a job here."
bad,The managers are barely literate on most levels until you reach upper management.  The executive and upper management teams are completely out of touch with the everyday worker and there is a glut of incompetent and illiterate low- mid level mangers who make working for the company miserable.  This was my experience across multiple lines of business unfortunately.
bad,I was told in training no handle time. In nesting was told was a handle time. 3 minutes on phone was asked what was taking me so long by floor support
bad,"Horrific management. It won't seem that way in the beginning, but will show overtime. Very immature, vindictive, cliquey and gossipey female managers in the Charlotte, NC office that create a hostile work environment. Male managers who are left, are just completely inept, including Underwriting site leader, who openly encourages and participates in discriminatory conduct.  Previous uw site leader literally just resigned one morning, after being with company for 10 years, and left within hours."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,The manager at the Pascagoula Branch is the worst manager I've ever had in my entire work history.  She is evil and vindictive and there are no repercussions for her despite the policy  that allows you to report unethical behavior.  It's swept under the rug
bad,"Customer service managers need to be willing and patient while helping new employees. They should also never embarrass employee in front of customers and if asked to speak in private will not step away so that you can speak privately. Should never demean employees, but encourage and help support an environment where you can feel free to ask questions and not be made to feel stupid"
bad,"My branch was opened everyday"
bad,Working for Wells Fargo is interesting. I learned a LOT about communication and what not to do from bad examples. But I have had so many opportunities to grow and learn. I really love my current management team as well as the research involved in my current job.
bad,While some leaders are fantastic others are not so fantastic. Some employees could be rude. It is a high stress job for sure. It is very structured and drives for more sales than I would prefer.
bad,Things might have changed now that they took away all the sales goals but a few years ago it was a horrible environment to work in and people were doing unethical things  and now the bank has a huge fine.
bad,"Managers are a*** when it comes to any medical issue, you are not allowed for a while to move from your position if you find something more beneficial for you."
bad,"This position was a great strater job and it pays well. However, if you are use to solving problems this is not the position. Everything is to fit into a one type situation. The management only prefers you if you are in their face and the moment that changes they will find anything to fire you. Also, if you have any issues don't bother using HR, they will find a way to fire you if you do report anything against managers or anyone with a title they want to stay. Come in and just do your job, they say they want you to make friends but it's a trap. They want to get into your personal life and then will talk about you once you open up. The company seems to be really great but this call center atmosphere is a culture of it's own."
bad,"I enjoy a challenge, and my job is indeed challenging! Every day is a new adventure.  However, due to regulations and DOL implementation, my job has also become somewhat of a rote routine.  I enjoy working with my team, our CAs and FAs, and branch managers.  In a compliance role, sometimes this is difficult.  However, I feel that since I understand a lot about what they are going through in their roles, I know how to make things as simple and pain-free as possible to help them achieve compliance while running their business."
bad,Wells Fargo relies on cheap and expendable temp agents at the expense of everything else. Churn is phenomenally high and the chances of breaking into a permanent position are negligible.
bad,Management was very horrible high turn over rate it was very stressful high call volume I don't feel like I was trained properly management wasn't helpful at all. Very busy call center there wasn't much advancement within the company
bad,"Poorly run company consumed in chaos, conflict and ambiguity.  Personal vendettas abound.  Poor regard for regulations.  Regulations considered advisory.  Many incompetent and lazy people in senior roles waiting for retirement."
bad,A typical day started at 7 am the Tellers arrive  first open  the store . then rest of the team arrive at 9 am for store opening. At Wells Fargo  advise to sell to each customer as many checking and sving account they able to apply for .
bad,Wells Fargo will do whatever they can to maximize profit and the expense of its people. So be prepared to be stressed out of your mind for little reward. The one thing it did have going for it was the average day to day people. They are inspiring and life changing and try to make you a better person. Executives on the other hand only care about their wallets.
bad,I enjoyed working there until management started focusing more on sales than handling customer concerns. I met all of my goals except the continuous change of the sales goal.
bad,"While I thoroughly enjoyed working there in the beginning, it started to get extremely stressful. The constant push to meet sales goals and the ignoring of customers' wants or needs became too much."
bad,"This isn't a place you want to work they try and brainwash you that you are doing good but really the only good that could happen is that someone shuts down Wells Fargo for the criminal enterprise it is... They don't care they are over priced, they don't care people don't like them,  They don't care people don't want to do business with them.... but you are the one who has to act like you care even tho no one behind you does.... terrible place"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"People in management did not feel genuine. Lot of call center politics feel to it. You get your own desk. You use a dual screen monitor while on the phones. VERY SHORT IDLES. Call after call after call after call. You get yelled at over the phone quite frequently, because of people over drafting their accounts."
bad,"This company does not treat it's employees well at all! The location I worked for outsourced to the Philippines! EVERYONE lost their jobs...here...in the U.S.!!! The banking side screws over their customers. Do NOT become an authorized on someone''s checking accout!  If they go overdrawn Wells Fargo WILL pull the funds from your own personal checking account  (where that other person is NOT associated with in any way, shape, or form). That's not even legal. Personal bankers ALWAYS fail to inform checking account holders that overdraft protection IS a credit card...they just never get a physical card... that it's just a credit card used only for when a customer would have gone into the negative. Many other issues... just don't... don't work there, don't become a customer, and if you are a customer I would advise you switch banks."
bad,"Don't get me wrong, Wells Fargo pays well and the benefits are decent once you're hired on full time. However, the company culture can be very toxic. The number of departments where people are happy to work there is few. Everything about the company is about the bottom line."
bad,"I was not happy with how customers were treated in many cases, as related to recent news stories about the company.  I witnessed it firsthand countless times by customer service representatives who were expected to treat customers as the company's most valuable asset.  It's contradictory to the public image the company wants to have."
bad,This was probably the worst job I ever worked. Sitting around being screamed at by people all day. My manager would write you up for not being able to get a payment for an account.
bad,"Working at Wells Fargo as a contractor was a reasonably good experience.  I worked exclusively from a home office, which was very good for work / life balance.  The compensation was somewhat below average for my industry.  I would never work for Wells Fargo again because government investigations have recently exposed their lack of corporate integrity and ethics.  Their business model pushed sales staff to create a vast number of bogus customer accounts in order to inflate metrics and collect undue commissions.  Management did not show proper oversight and moral values."
bad,"Extreme inner turmoil.  They have issues.  Unless you are young, you don't have a chance.  Management is unskilled.  I feel certain that Henry Wells and William Fargo are rolling in the grave at what has become of the place."
bad,In training you are expected to know what the trainer is talking about about the job. The production goals are unrealistic they set goals that are not east to obtain. The culture for promotions is the its not what you know its who you know which impacts morale.
bad,good environment to work with. Very good learning expereience. Wonderful team. Made some very good professional advancements working in this firm
bad,"I have nothing to say about the company , it paid my bills and fed my children .For that I am grateful. blah blah.. nothing to say ,at all........"
bad,I loved my job but the job atmosphere wasn't so professional. the management needs improvement. It was not a good place to work for .
bad,"If you become an employee of the Wells Fargo Call Center do not apply for a phone banker!  I repeat do not apply for a phone banker!  It is an extremely stressful and unethical position.  Try to become apart of Banker Connection, Sales, basically any other department other than phone banking.  They make less money than other departments and deal with more issues."
bad,"No wonder bankers are the richest. Tellers don't make money. The whole game of ""getting solutions"" for your customers brings them a lot of new business and up-sales but little gain to the worker. Work hard, sell hard, service with a smile, and stay broke."
bad,"When working at Wells Fargo, I would perform daily vault tasks as well as tasks with the ATM. I would try to get customers to open new account to hit my sales goal for the month."
bad,"I feel that if you have supervisors that are going to be as Nereida Nunez was to me and my other co-workers, then there should be more training, or at least more supervisors hired from the outside. This is because I believe that the only reason she became a supervisor was not due to work ethic or knowledge of work, but because she was a ""favorite"" or ""friend"" of someone hire-up in the ranks."
bad,Although I enjoyed my time there the management was horrible!! I worked in online banking & although we received templates of responses that we were supposed to use we were prohibited from sharing with other employees & some were fired for doing so just because they were in competition with the CIC in Charlotte.
bad,"We has to recommend products and services as part of our daily ""metrics"". We were held to certain numbers and even if we were good at some numbers we had to hit all of our numbers on a daily basis. We were constantly in fear for our jobs, consequently we were under so much pressure to perform that stress often got in the way of doing our best."
bad,"Management has 3 conference calls a day to help them pressure their co-workers. A typical day at WF is receiving emails asking you what are your sales like and if they're not up to par, they ask you what are committed to do to change that by the end of the day. It's super stressful!"
bad,"I assist with opening the store, issuing cash. I have learned how to defuse situations in a professional manner. My management is ok, although it has changed three times in two years. Hardest part of the job is getting everyone to come to work. I enjoy just helping others and developing my skills for growth."
bad,"I do not enjoy working with this company."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Big Box Store for financial services..... You might find what you need, even get the right price on it, however, try getting someone who really knows what they're talking about and can get you some definate help with educated answers and contiuned support going forward..... (Good Luck!)"
bad,"The only thing good about working for the CALL CENTER (not sure about actual branches, I think they are way different) is the money is ok. For a call center positon i started off at $12 an hour and their insurance is decent. This job as a ""Phone Banker"" is very stressful, they pressure you to make sales every second of your shift, if you are behind even a little bit you will have someone coming up behind you nagging you. It's not easy selling something to someone when all they wanted in the first place was just their balance! It's just way too stressful and the hours suck unless you get lucky. The management are non compassionate, they're just worried about how their ""team"" is ranking and if you are the person that is dragging the team down as a whole for whatever varies reasons you'll get a rude attitude from your supervisor. Bottom line-go to another call center if you can, Wells Fargo in Lubbock Texas is not it! Suddenlink is way better and treats their employees waaaaaay better."
bad,"Anyone who is a customer of Wells Fargo, via their hostile takeover of Wachovia knows the headaches of adjusting to a million new rules and restrictions. I genuinely enjoy helping people but have been baffled at the contradictory policies of this company at least on a retail level. They preach ""WOWing"" the customer but all the procedures seem to do nothing but enrage them. Makes our jobs extremely difficult."
bad,Answering calls all day
bad,"They have a very high turn over rate, they don’t pay you enough to deal with customers that have issues they can very easily fix... in other words very ghetto would not recommend."
bad,"Great technical environment but the leadership and management were extremely prejudiced towards minorities. The implement and execute a veiled racist operational practices through marginalization, under valuing, employees."
bad,I didn't enjoy my time with Wells Fargo. I created bonds and friendships but I did not enjoy my time. I was required to work every weekend. The goals was so unattainable I wasn't willing to put my integrity on the line and stood up for what I felt was right.
bad,"Managers are unmotivating and treat there workers like slaves. Bad at managing personalties, not honest, loyal or trust worthy. Also provide a culture where workers are treated like children."
bad,"It was hard getting up and going to work on a daily basis. The people didn't want to help, treated you as if an outsider. Ii uhc gtujv yo ik jhgikhukk."
bad,"The atmosphere is very stressful and as they displace positions they place the workflow on the existing employees. The tools used to make the work flow easier are convoluted and out dated. When conversion took place from Wachovia to Wells Fargo platform, we regressed and it made for frustration on employees and clients. Work became more metrics than customer service. I worked for the Wachovia/Wells Fargo for over 35 yrs. and was very disappointed with what it has become and the reason that I left. The pay is less than enough for the stress, frustration and take home work you drag home each day."
bad,"If you enjoy covert insults, a corporate HR line that takes over 60 days to address your concerns and management that doesn’t take you seriously when you bring to their attention that you’re being bullied, this is the perfect place for you. If you’re a woman, just don’t show any confidence and the men will like you; otherwise you’ll be called and treated like you’re arrogant. There is no ongoing market training and they won’t even  allow their employees to listen to the Wells Fargo market call. Fees they charge clients are high and they don’t even keep clients with the same advisor long term  I feel sad for clients and employee potential is held back to the max unless you conform to a narcissistic culture"
bad,"Get Out and stay away. "
bad,"At first glance, it seems like a fun job with lots of games and decorations and a fun environment. Training was a blast. However, once you get on the floor it gets depressing. In training, they tell you not to worry about how long your calls take (AHT) because solving the customer's problems is the most important part of the job. But once you get on the floor they will constantly hound you to lower your AHT to meet that metric, even if you do every other part of your job really well. It's near impossible to have a low handle time while actually solving the customer's problem. If you have to wait on a long hold to transfer the customer to a certain department to help them or to get help outside of what you can do, it will still count against your AHT and hold time."
bad,"Wells Fargo has great benefits, however I would describe the culture as nothing less than toxic. Negativity is spread among employees and some management and nothing is done to change the negative talk. Moreover, most of the complaints from said employees and management are warranted. There is little-to-no accountability in several areas which require collaborative efforts among departments (most specifically, the mortgage lending department)."
bad,"Management is Horrible , you get secret shoppers weekly ,  you always have  to push products it can  be a little overwhelming and unfair .    Not everyone sells but yet they still get the bonuses!  Customers can be down right rude at times and management does not care !"
bad,Very fraudulent company. Just an other bank that has a  bunch of pencil pushers who end up turning profit in the end. Business as usual in the banking industry
bad,"Phone bankers take on average 80-100 calls a shift, micro management for call length, referral rate, and call transfers to sales. (This is right before WF was caught opening fake accounts, cards, etc.) Work place was stressful, and turn around rate was very high. Supervisor was great, but couldn't make up for the rest of the company's flaws."
bad,"This is the first and only job I have been terminated from. Let alone the most embarrassing experience ever. After 4 years, i am still affected by the termination. Overall the way i was treated at Wells Fargo and not treated with respect...it was disgusting to be honest. Let’s alone the regional manager was unresponsive to my concerns, the Loss Prevention Rep was poor at her job and the HR department didn’t do nothing for me."
bad,"Wells Fargo is not a consistent place to work.  Some groups are productive and well managed.  Other groups are chaotic and a real grind."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Manager was young and inexperienced. You got I trouble for simple mistakes. I loved most of the people I worked with. Theres scheduling was stupid. I wouldnt recommend this company.
bad,"Just like you’ve heard before the management is as bad as it comes. Wells Fargo will blackball you and target you If they feel even the slightest bit insecure about their skills. They don’t listen to you. They also ALL gossip between levels of management, and between branches. Really should have left sooner."
bad,"I was employed back when we were Wachovia and things were okay until Wells Fargo took over. Then came highly impractical procedural changes, which were not cost effective, then as years went by more departments were getting dissolved lowering our volume, and now I’m facing reduced hours and potential dismissal after 10 years of stalwart service."
bad,"All you have to do is Google ""Wells Fargo Bank corruption"" and you can read all you want to about the deceipt, and corruption over the past several years."
bad,"they do not work well with life threatening issues a worker may have. They claim they try to help but did no suck thing. Now im out of "
bad,"Mass hiring mass firing.  Apparent stole talent from competition at peak of market then when interest rates went up very little, laid masses off within 6 months of hiring.  Direct manager was awesome but his manager was an awful person and completely inept."
bad,"Working at Wells Fargo was difficult due to the lack of good mgmt and the negative environment.  Wells Fargo would change rules constantly and job security was always in question no matter if you worked there a week or 20 years.  They did not seem to care about their employees, you were just a number."
bad,"When I started with the Home Equity it was Norwest Bank and I loved to go to work everyday, the people, management, culture was friendly, helpful, and ethical. the job was fast paced and challenging but you didn't notice it as much because the people around you made it fun and were helpful. Sometime after Wells Fargo took over the Job got political, when the dress code changed so did the company and it all about numbers, numbers, numbers. I like numbers as much as the next banker, but not when my customer and I loose our names to just become a number. Sadly it took Federal regulators and high fines for management to listen, unfortunately just like it takes years for things to trickle up it also takes years for things to trickle down especially for a top 5 bank. Besides management the hardest thing is being accountable for quality with the worst training or no training at all."
bad,"Not the place to work if you truly care to help your customers out. This place is built on ripping its customers off and they know it. Mangers really care about you as a person but its all about business though. So, career and banking, take it somewhere else."
bad,"The Wells Fargo bank I worked at had alot of drama, but mostly from the bank's management. There was alot of favoritism and inappropriate relationships"
bad,"I worked in this facility over two years ago and it has since been shut down and collections department relocated.  "
bad,"Wells Fargo has the best benefits plan out there. But the way they treat their employees and want us to meet quotas. I ridiculous. And the supervisors actually tell you, you have to let customers verbally abuse you. That is not right at all."
bad,"The requirements of your job is very well know and you have a lot of information to guide you and your role.        "
bad,"I was always very proud to work for Wells Fargo, until they became greedy with their sales tactics.  It was like throwing wet toilet paper against a wall and seeing what sticks.  If they ever end these practices, they may turn it around"
bad,"High volume call center environment. Did gain some valuable skills/knowledge about how security systems on debit and credit cards work as well as fraud trends. Learned how to identify callers and ask probing questions."
bad,Would not recommend as a great place to work.  Have made some changes since I've been there. The goals they set for you to achieve were unrealistic to do every month.
bad,I just h ated how strict they were but sometimes that is for the best ..great managemtnet actually knew what they were doing I loved it there  wishit was more casual
bad,"Management typically would be unreasonable, and was constantly changing expectations day to day. Would become very angry when expectations were not met, even when they gave no time to accomplish tasks. Very unprofessional environment"
bad,"My immediate manager was fine, the upper C class folks, I have other feelings for that are not great. My review for this company is to google Wells Fargo and read what comes up about the company. Its hard to work for a company like that."
bad,I have no qualms about the people I worked with. All very nice and helpful. But the job wasn't just helping customers. You also had to push sales sales sales on everyone that called. It was very stressful and that stress bled into my personal life.
bad,This is not a good place to work when you get treated like you do not matter. Team mates treat other disrespectful and if you miss work due to being deathly sick and have a doctors note they don't care
bad,"dos system, temp postition and not sure what the work envoirment so could not tell you what they really are like past the temp contract. some say its ok"
bad,"Really big on sales, the manager at the time would harass you to ask family members to open accounts so that the branch could reach their daily goals."
bad,"constant movement to remove and re-purpose staff."
bad,"Wells Fargo is a GREAT BANK and a GREAT place to work HOWEVER the management was horrible & the opportunities were limited! I couldn't get from school to work in time due to the fact that the manager wouldn't schedule me hours hours my school schedule.. The customers were GREAT , but the vibe and the staff around me was WEAK and didn't have good customer service at all"
bad,"The hiring process is horrible. They will only hire you if you happen to know someone who works there. The managers/recruiters literally have a 3-ring binder full of questions and pick about 6 right before your interview. "
bad,the place is a great place to work just don't bank with them. have told them for years that unethical sales practices were going on and they did nothing to stop it.
bad,If you guys wanna join this company under any Muslim manager then you will be screwed badly coz such a biased azz holes they are.You have lick their azz bloody beggars.
bad,"I'm not sure how either of the managers got their jobs, but they aren't even kind of qualified. The assistant bank manager was very unprofessional and hovered around you while you were working with customers. I took this job thinking I was getting out of sales, only to find that it was basically a sales job. There was a lot of pressure to perform. Customers got very annoyed when I would try to suggest other banking options but I was pushed to ask anyway. Overall, I really did not enjoy this job. I quit after a month."
bad,The typical day consisted of trying to do the job of 3 people. There is never enough staffing to run the system the way they insist on.  Every activity requires two people from opposite  functions but there are not enough people working to ever have the necessary teams. I've worked in fast paced environments and been overworked but Wells Fargo wants all that while sabotaging your ability to do anything. The PTO given is good but hard to get approved due to staffing issues. I learned that I want to work in a position where the customer comes first and I am able to make a difference. Management is Wells Fargo 100%. They follow the rule to the letter despite stressing and acting on that stress. My co-workers were the best part of he job. The hardest part of my job was not being able to put the customer first. The most enjoyable part was interacting with my customers.
bad,"Typical day at work was spent sitting for very long hours processing files via phone, internet, or fax.  I learned how mortgaging processes work.  Management was a mixed-bag with a wide range.  Teams were formed, dismantled, and traded so frequently that a coworker and I kept a count of our cubicle moves which totaled 34.  Co-workers were helpful for the most part.  Hardest part of the job was sitting for so long.  The most enjoyable part was free coffee, and working with people who remain friends to this day."
bad,The calls are coming in back to back and you have to meet daily expectations. Because your fresh on the floor you'll be coached and trained to make your daily goals and expectations.
bad,"At Wells Fargo I took incoming calls from customers regarding their credit card accounts.  I handles disputes, fraud issues to make sure they got completed in a timely manner."
bad,"Monitoring different building,keeping log of the trucks that coming in and out and also making sure the gates are lock."
bad,sales and customer service take care of the task at hand. working for the customers and wow as well as audits.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"A typical day was Answering phones for 8 hours a day and answering customers banking questions."
bad,Service new and existing bank customer for all of there financial needs.
bad,"When I first started, I was excited. Everyone was very helpful and friendly until you get the hang of it. Afterwards, good luck the sales goals where in the town I worked was borderline ridiculous. They make you feel like they care about you and your advancement opportunities which is a lie. When an advancement opportunity came along they already knew who they were going to hire before holding interviews. I ultimately quit because of the harassment of my managers to meet unrealistic sales goals"
bad,"i liked to work with people, but the coaching and training was terrible."
bad,I really enjoy working in a financial environment. I've been in banking since I was eighteen years old and worked full time while earning a bachelors degree in business management. I am looking for a full-time job in the financial field that will allow mw to earn the income that I was hoping to earn at graduation. I am a fast learning that excels in a sales environment and who actually loves what I do. I am looking for a position that will allow me to learn what I need to know to advance in the banking industry and to utilize my management degree.
bad,working as a personal banker open accounts for the bank and other products
bad,A nice place to work if you don't expect to make any money.  Their is plenty of work to be done but the fa's are not too concerned about how it gets done as long as its cheap labor.
bad,"fast pace, meenting new people, nice coworkers."
bad,a typical day at work
bad,Horrible job... I hated it. They told me that they would fire me if I didn't make my sales. All they cared about was SALES SALES SALES! Later on when I was closing my account at another Wells Fargo the personal banker told me she didn't make her sales for a year and a half. She then told me there not allowed to fire you for your sales. The managers were rude at my branch. I wouldn't recommend working for this company unless your good at making sales and opening new accounts. Managers will constantly stand behind you making sure your asking customers to open accounts and that your offering other solutions.
bad,i dont have anything to say about wells fargo about my time there other than they cared far more about numbers and quotas than they did about their clients and customers
bad,The company tries to make  seem like they care for their employees but it is a smoke screen. They pile on the work load of three people and when you are honest and state you can't make their unrealistic deadlines they just tell you to figure it out. Then when the manager makes a mistake they write the employee up for the mistakes.
bad,"I WAS part of the culture of sell @ Wells Fargo. We HAD to sell something or we would potentially lose our jobs. We'd try to sell credit cards or home mortgages as best we could. We used to be able just to introduce signing the client up for online banking as a means to ""get through"" the 'sales', but they took that away from us. We were told to see selling additional products as an actual ""need"", but in reality, especially through my time, within the end of the recession, many people didn't need anything extra. "
bad,it was pretty intense management the sales and operations of a bank but it was rewarding working with a team and always having an opportunity for growth
bad,"Wells is mis-managed from the minute you walk in to the time you leave."
bad,Management has changed since I was there but it was horrible. Advancement and pay was decent but the worst part was the pushing sales. Breaks were far and few between.
bad,I was at Wells Fargo for a few years before they forced sales on my floor.  We either sold a set amount or we lost our jobs. some chose fraud over being fired.
bad,Wells Fargo was an interesting place to work. They try to be transparent but that could be further from the truth. They make demands on you that are out of your control but still expect results which aren't fair.
bad,"Great benefits, terrible culture.  The management is spineless and you are treated like a minion.  Make no mistake, the benefits are great but the raises are horrific.   The last 4 years there I averaged raises of $0.19."
bad,Too many people with their hands in too many things that overcomplicate things for no reason. Very unorganized and the micromanagement is excessive due to poor employee performance.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,They dont care about their customers or employees. They are mostly concerned with money not the regular person and how we can help them. The people that are there for the customers are the first ones they will get rid of
bad,"I left because, generally speaking, the executives turn a blind eye to risky behavior that goes on in the lines of business.  Specifically, the businesses are allowed to accept risk and run risky business processes, go unpoliced, without acceptable controls in place to mitigate those risks...leading to a culture of ""it is cheaper to beg for forgiveness that ask for permission."""
bad,With all the scandals from Wells.. our managers are quick to point the finger and not taking ownership. It's sad that they don't care about the team. Hypocritical statements all the time..
bad,"what a horrible culture in the agoura hills branch."
bad,"Bigoted leadership team. People who fall into certain buckets will be profiled and disciplined harshly for things other people get away with, with no questions asked. "
bad,"UW department in Tempe is the most unorganized dept I have ever worked with. I do not recommend working here! Manager changes, there are no leads to ask questions to. No one is willing to help new employees."
bad,"If you like the financial industry and can see yourself developing skills sets within the company, Wells Fargo is the way to go. They train you for each position and raise from within."
bad,Wells Fargo does not care much about employees. Management seems to only be motivated by numbers. I understand business is about making money but they seem to sacrifice work environment for making money.
bad,"Wells Fargo was a very unpleasant experience for me. i have had so much hard time during my career journey. So much favoritism and discrimination is going on. Like they always object me that why I was speaking my own language with my coworkers and i can not do this, but all the time they were speaking Spanish that I don't understand. my manager let her favorite employees take a long time lunch. Some employees choose their own customer then they dont welcome customer to shift the customer towards other tellers. My manager could see all this action, but she did not say anything when i rich out to her; she responds to me very rudely and defends her favorite employee. Also one they one of my lead tellers come to the bank when she was at vacation time and open her computer for ni reason and she did something on her computer no one did not ask her why and what are you doing. When the branch manager asked her whats happened, she said that i had to check something and tries to take off the responsibility to respond to this question. "
bad,"No comment..I do not want to talk about experience at wells fargo. I will say it's not the best place to work at. Remember, they did get sued for bad banking practices."
bad,I have no comments about wells fargo. They are an ok company to work for. They have good benefits. I wouldn't trust some managers though. Overall a good company
bad,If you can find a good branch with fair Managers then it is amazing job to have. Unfortunately most branches aren’t like that & they usually hire people they know even if they don’t have prior experience. I’ve worked at fair branches & I’ve worked at some that are horrible because it’s “click” mentality. I’ve seen some really bad cases were they would force someone to quit by cutting their hours to nothing.
bad,"I started at Wells Fargo very excited for my next adventure. However, I quickly learned that if you don't meet sales goals and try to up sell to EVERY customer, you will be talked too.Supervisors even watched some of your interactions and recorded what you did right or wrong. Once it was reviewed with you, you would sign the ""road map"" and it was added to your file. Management was okay at first, with an understanding and supportive supervisor but when she moved away, we got a very rude, judgmental and biased supervisor in her place. If she did not like you, you were out of luck, I loved my coworkers and the location but the company values and poor management were enough for me to search for a different career."
bad,"Overall I enjoyed my job but the branch manager at the Port Angeles Wells Fargo "
bad,Unprofessional. Lack of empathy. Ruthless management. Undeniably disrespectful towards their customer. It’s been a few years since their scandal and they have yet to learn their lesson on professional development and customer experience. If you work or bank here good luck!
bad,"They do a lot shady things and never get caught , they run people credit without there permission every 3 month, managers get paid handsome but there never there there"
bad,I would never work for this company ever again in life. They treat you like your beneath them. The racial slurs that come from the Fort Mill SC office. They talk down to you in Human Resources and belittle you in front of management.
bad,"My horrible experience was because of management. I had a manager who purposely trained me wrong. She would tell me to make customer transactions that led to risks so that I would look bad and appear not to do my job correctly. She also brought me in a meeting and said ""I don't like you""  I felt this was very unprofessional. When I would come to work there would be light-skinned jokes or talks about my clothes and what my manager would wear or would not wear. There would be gossip and fraternizing at this job management would be holding hands and cuddling in the back with other employers while leaving the teller line to be run by new employees instead of taking that time to train them. Management conversations would also be about selling furniture on facebook rather than giving the proper attention to the employees that were needed for their development.  Tasks were rushed through with no thorough teaching base and effective training base to build with the knowledge of policies and procedures. It also felt like high school coming to work and a manager said out loud ""We have our click"". They would also laugh and joke and talk about the customers and flirt with some customers and when customers leave the branch they would ask for that customer information to see how much money they had and if they would pursue provoking a casual relationship with them. They also would have huddles based on things like how many people slept within their personal lives or the worst pickup line rather than about the Wells Fargo things we should be learning. They also would show favoritism to some"
bad,"My life was absolute fine until I went to work at this bank. They harass, stalk and get into peoples life and overstep boundaries. They send calls to your phone that are erratic behavior then try to act like something wrong with you. They provoke people by doing things unethical and then act like you’re the issue. This job is completely unethical, mistreats there employees, violates hippa laws, tell lies to the next job you go to and violates several policies as a company. Nobody should have to go through what my family and I have been through dealing with this job period! I do not recommend this job to anyone. The pay is good but not worth the changes you and your family would go through. Please keep looking there are better opportunities. Better jobs that will respect you"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"When the CEO ""retires"" after being court ordered to give files about our current president I find that fishy and we had a meeting where it was discussed that the way Wells Fargo made money was off the poor by fees and interest.. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH WELLS FARGO THEY STEAL FROM THE POOR AND GIVE IT TO THE RICH."
bad,"they promote very oddly, all interview questions are behavioral questions about nothing to do with the job. "
bad,"Fraudulent account opening, selling credit cards to customers they don't need. Hostile work environment that I hope has changed. Bonuses are sales based which would be fine if it was a different selling environment."
bad,"Its not what you know its who you know to move up in the company. Raises are severely low no matter how good you perform. The company allows managers to cuss and yell at you in front of the whole team and will make excuses as the behavior continues. Poor professionalism, pay, recognition, and the ability to respect you as an individual. Be prepared to provide your own holiday pot lucks as there are no meals or parties provided. Also provide your own birthday decorations its not in their budget."
bad,I hated it there. They did not like you asking questions during train for fear of the trainee knowing more than the trainer. Management was only knowledgeable about the policy and not the actual job you perform.
bad,The team that I worked with was a hot mess. It was difficult to work with a remote team with little to no understanding of Agile software development.
bad,"the work volume was tremendous and there was constant pressure to get loans to the closing table from not only the loan officers but also management.  The pressure was unlike any i've experience in the industry over my 18 years in working in mortgages,  tough place to work."
bad,"wells fargo allowed me to further my career,  i made great friends with lasting memories on how we were able to build it up,  the move from chester to philly was great."
bad,"Long training"
bad,"Too large for my liking.  I prefer to spend my days in a much smaller atmosphere.  The corporate world is not for me.  I have worked in a few different places in all the years I've been employed and this was my least favorite,"
bad,Was not beneficial for employees. stressful work environment. Lots of meetings and micromanaging.Lots of criticiss. no staff support. hard to get personal time.
bad,"During my tenure, Wells was going through a lot of turmoil (all of which was reported in the press).  Difficult working conditions.  Lots of turnover."
bad,You have to go in and meet with the store manager and determine the goals for your day and see how you are ranking for the month. Once the doors open you have to assist the clients and keep constant comunication with the manager. But the managers are terrible... They push you to offer products that provide no benefits to the clients.
bad,there is a less than 1% planned success rate for new fa trainees when someone leaves the accounts only go to the biggest producers you never have a chance
bad,"They do not give raises, promotions yes but not raises.  They lock you in at a rate and do not take cost of living into consideration.  Will not go back"
bad,"For the short time I worked at WF, they told me I needed to push my morals aside to make a sale. Constant belittling of your conscious decision to not sell someone, who already has a maxed out credit card, another credit card."
bad,I would not recommend this company even to my enemy. They are a huge revolving door employer. You get hired you get laid off you get hired you get laid off. Can't plan a future with the  continued roller coaster of not knowing if you're going to have a job the next day.
bad,Disgraceful bank.  Wells Fargo acquired a lousy company that failed because of poor management decisions that trickled down to its employees killing retirements.
bad,"High stress high pace work environment. Production driven, unrealistic goals. Dress code was some what lax for certain employees considering that it was a professional atmosphere."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"this was a great opportunity and i am glad wells fargo allowed me to be apart of it.  the company is great, besides the low pay in a very expensive area to live in and the horrible manager.    the only thing the company cared  about was sales of bad products and expected a small branch with a town population of 10k."
bad,"Wells Fargo is a large company that offers opportunity for growth and learning. However, they are very disingenuous in terms of ethics. They do not put the customer first. They do everything they can to game the system and earn as much as possible without consideration for ethics and morality. While I enjoyed earning a good living and having good benefits, after a time, I became more and more despondent knowing I was working for a company that was doing everything it could to cover up and spin wrongdoing. They have a robust audit and compliance department but that is only lip service. They campaign diligently to roll back any government checks and balances in place to protect consumers."
bad,there are to many employees that believes they are above the policy and procedure. employees are selective with new employees. if you may be liked or hated. corporate is no help and management are to busy looking pretty
bad,"Bad middle managers, bad supervisors. Human Resource have nothing to do with its personnel working in every department. SO if you have a bad manager, then its bad luck to you."
bad,This company dos not care if you succeed. They will ensure you are not rehirable. They're wore than the IRS.They make you reapply if all you need to do is transfer locations. They would rather keep you on the phones than help you advance. This company is a black whole.
bad,It was an awful work experience.  We weren't there to take care of the customers but to make sales.  Management was terrible.  I think that's obvious as to what happened with the company.
bad,"I had two projects with Wells Fargo. They were both very strange. In one, I was kept at work in my cubicle and only talked with one other person one the phone in North Carolina. I was very directly told that I should not talk to anyone else, only this one person. On the first day, my manager told me that I was not to ever interrupt her, not to send messages or try to talk with her.  When I said Hi to anyone in the lunch room, I was chastised and reminded to only talk to this one person. I caused a rumpus when a senior person stopped by my cubicle and asked if I was interested in doing the same work for a different group.  I said sure and gave him my recruiters name and number. Basically, I only interacted with my manager when she was yelling at me for being a human being. But I did great work."
bad,Just not a great organization.  People I worked with were great but the over all culture of the organization I did not agree with a lot their practices
bad,Too big of a machine without a care for the workers on the front line. Being a number on a clipboard doesn't appeal to me so it is time to take my talents where thy can be appreciated.
bad,I enjoyed working for Wells Fargo while I was still employed there.  I didnt understand why they did a huge ramp up of hiring only to lay us all off several months later.
bad,"Bad career move to join the firm.  They misrepresented the opportunity and didn't provide the resources or support to be successful.  Managers focused on reporting up, not managing."
bad,I worked in a large call center which had several departments on one floor. The entire 3rd floor of customer service was laid off while I was in training. My training team moved onto the floor shortly after.
bad,"Constant pressure to sell or be fired. Even as a CSR, you are expected to make sales. This was not discussed during the interview or even training so it is an unrealistic expectation"
bad,Worked there for about a year and they are awesome great pay great people to work with and they make sure y U know what you are doing before the truanting classes are up.
bad,"Very professional and results oriented culture.  Adequate competitive environment and market knowledge by most colleagues.  On the negative side, though, very difficult to hire and retain talent required to complete tasks due to unnecessarily high stress levels."
bad,The management did not follow company policy but took law to their own hand. Talk to people and you will confirm this. Many left the company out of frustration and wicked reviews.
bad,"Needs a better professionals in office for branches."
bad,"This company does not care about it's employees and only cares about sales and will do anything to get them, even if it's unethical. The pay is also minimal."
bad,"terrible terrible place to work. "
bad,"Working at the Wells Fargo Industry was a great experience for me.  I would have enjoyed being a full time employee, but they were not hiring at the time.."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"I had this job when I was young. At the time it was decent money. IT would not be enough to cover my living expenses now, however. I liked the schedule I had here and I enjoyed my co workers and the referral bonuses."
bad,Wells Fargo has become a company in which the employees are disengaged due to lack of company advancement and feeling as if the leadership has the best interest of its employees
bad,The group I worked with had a horrible work environment and was very hostile to diversity. Other areas of compliance seem to have a healthy environment.
bad,"Staff is horrible to work with! Never work there..."
bad,"Management was not trust worthy."
bad,Sales sales sales. That's all they care about. You must meet your numbers. This company truly does not care about their employees. Rain or shine you must meet your sale goals.
bad,IT was okay just a terrible drive with horrendous management.Had to ask to use the resteroom and was constantly berated. All maangerment was rude and unhelpful
bad,This company is no longer in existence.  It was bought by another security agency in 2000.  I do not know if the agency that bought it is around any longer.
bad,I did not like working for this company I enjoyed what I did for them and the customer interactions but the managements was not very good they didn’t not back their employee
bad,"Wells Fargo is the worst Corporation to work for. If you are planning to move, you might as well just put in your 2 weeks notice. For a company so big, they do not help your transfer. You have to reapply to a open position, interview and hope they pick you. If you don't you automatically get terminated. That is horrible to their employees. It is also the only company that doesn't help transfer. They are all about the money and could care less about their employees"
bad,this is a high pressure sales company in every position. even the tellers had to meet quotas for referrals. not a lot of training or internal promotions.
bad,"The fact that this is one of the larget banking institutions is extremely scary. Wells Fargo does not care about its employees or its customers, They drive you to open accounts, at any cost."
bad,"I was witness to many unethical behaviors that were taking place in the branches.  I have very strong moral values and when I went o report what I had witnessed, it was brushed off and not corrected."
bad,Management is very supportive and tries their best to help you be successful. Friendly co workers and everyone tries their best to make it fun to go to work.
bad,"Staff at Wachovia will think that you are nothing when you first start they think that they all the stuff, and they are the big deal.they will not help you at all i am not sure what they think they are they do."
bad,"Management was awful and unorganized."
bad,"Never work there. you could have a perfect call and the customer could love you and say you were perfect and amazing, but your supervisor will find something wrong with your call and then spend an hour criticizing it"
bad,"These people don't care about people. This is literally what my manager said,""I don't want to talk about people, I can move and remove whomever I want."" A good majority of people who have worked here will retire here as they don't know how to work anywhere else. Their processes are outdated and archaic. Still doing waterfall. Their tech support is embarrassing. Hours, weeks, and several months to fix anything.  I literally googled all my issues. Most days I see people kiss up to the managers to get praise. If you're not liked, you will not be promoted. While I was here another manager from across the office decided to tell me I needed to be in the office everyday and questioned why I wasn't there everyday. Wait, you're not my manager??? You're also not in my department. I don't even work with you! The guy should be managing his team but his team are hard workers, he does nothing.  People don't smile and there is a lack of teamwork, collaboration and general people skills. People will threaten you, harass you, and talk behind your back. Also nepotism, high level managers bring in their friends with no experience to work here. Do yourself a favor and don't work here. Run!"
bad,Just dnt go in as a temp. Keep ya mouth closed at training unless answering a question. last but not least. come in do your work and go home trust noone. idc how big their smile is.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"If you do not like sales goals and deficits in such, this isn't the place for you.  Being such a large institution there is a lot of turnover and customers are broad - not very personable in most branches."
bad,I would say this place has lots of room for growth but the people that are in charge as managers are very dishonest thieves. The general manager I worked with was awesome but the service manager and lead teller were very dishonest lazy people. They will set you up with money and blame you so you can get fired. On top of that they are always robbed so its not a safe place to work for and they make you sell accounts to customers even if they do not need them. They will fire you if you do not meet threshold and are constantly harassing you in different ways. Diverse company and there are some good people there.
bad,Typical day was inbound calls back to back and you're being timed. Their main goal was to sell customers products they might use. The good thing about the call center was the upbeat environment and this particular one had a cafeteria.
bad,"it was an okay job, I wouldn't trust the managers and college ave branch is horrible."
bad,"Great place to work. The management staff takes career development seriously. Dealing with customers and complex situations are very rewarding. The manager takes a genuine interest in your growth personally and professionally,"
bad,"I was treated like an outsider in my Dept. Management unfairly targeted me. It was difficult coming to work everyday, knowing that you were not appreciated."
bad,"Will train off the street as wells Fargo states,great training program. Good ongoing training. The down side of wells fargo is that they don't value the front line employees that often resulted in high employee turnover rate. Thus, a very demanding job. On the other,  I also observed employees rising up the corporate latter."
bad,This company only really cares about what they can get out of a client and not really doing what they feel is in the best interest for the client's future goals.  A VERY high pressure sales goal oriented organization.
bad,"No leadership, high stress, and there are lots of other issues.  Good news :  The food was ok, and there were options indoors without having to leave the campus."
bad,A typical work day included working night deposit bags before opening and waiting on customers during working hours.  The hardest and most pressure packed thing was trying to sell each customer some type of product.
bad,"Although I like the work that I do and my peers at Wells Fargo, I have found the high pressure, corporate atmosphere to erode employee morale and motivation."
bad,"Wasn't the right fit for my personality type, however it was an excellent option for some folks. Different requires for everyone but the sales goals just didn't match my ethical guidelines"
bad,"I worked as a banker here years ago, but I seem unable to skip this step. They cleaned house after I left and the low quality management seems to have moved on. Very unqualified leadership team at the time."
bad,Lots of room for advancement. Very tough sales goals and press to meet daily quotas. Members concerned about hidden fees and products
bad,"Do not go work here. The company has more employees than most cities in the US. 250,000 employees. They could care less about their employees because they are soo huge."
bad,Corrupt work environment ... management encouraged to cheat customers especially during Wachovia merger . You had to cheat to advance basically
bad,Management not willing to work with her co-workers. doesn't do anything just sits there and yells at employees. sales goals are the worst no work ethic they don't care as long as you get your sales
bad,"I work for Wells Fargo right now. I have never been apart of such a mismanaged environment. I had a manager coming to work drunk for months, a DM that was trying to go behind HR to get information to keep his turnover rate low.  Wells Fargo does not care about their employees. Their sole purpose is to gain money through the sales, the sales are not intended to help customers but to increase financial gain for the company."
bad,does not care about their employees. just want new people in the door to train n out they go. do not work for them!!! wish I never accepted the job. everyone there hates it
bad,"I applied for a job at Wells Fargo in March 2016. I was told that I was selected as one of the top 3 applicants out of 93. I was asked a series of questions in a behavioral interview format, told to call or email if I had any questions whatsoever. Over two weeks went by and I never heard a word from these people. When I emailed HR personnel to inquire what was going on, they stated that someone dropped the ball, but still did not give me any info. Two weeks after that, I wrote again to say this was the most unprofessional interview and response that I've ever engaged in. HR personnel claims that they dropped the ball again, that I was not selected for the position, thanked me for coming in and wished me well; exclamation point!"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Based on my many yeas of personal and professional dealings with this company, I will never recommend it to anybody who has a grain of brain. "
bad,Management is not there to support you. They are there to intimidate and retaliate. Not what I thought it was. I went there for new job opportunity and growth potential but management gets away with intimidating employees and if you don't do what they want you get retaliation.
bad,This job has many policies that conflict with each other. It is very hard to meet the goals set with breaking the company policies.
bad,In the 3 years I worked for Wells Fargo it was never a great moment. The manager that I had in the beginning was unprofessional and there were a lot of bankers and tellers that behaved unethically to reach outrageous goals set by higher ups who had no idea what it was like to be in this crazy rat race they created. Trying to reach the same goals as a metro branch in a small town was ridiculous. Eventually I had to leave as the pressure was too much to handle and customer service was being placed on the back burner.
bad,"Overall Rating-three stars. Would review, anywhere from 20-30 loan applications a day. Take customer service calls from Bankers though-out the day. Good team cooperation with co-workers. Job environment very stress full at times due to large volume of loans that were give, Satisfaction being able to approve loan requests for customers."
bad,This bank is so sales hungry they open accounts for people that have so little money it's guaranteed to cause fees. That is part of their income plan. No integrity on the personal banking level.
bad,"Beware of this company. I do not feel the need to elaborate any more on this topic, you must see for yourself. The demands are not for everyone."
bad,This company overextends employees! Bonus agreements were not given by the employer. Rude and berating behavior was tolerated towards staff.
bad,"Good customer service work loans communicate with lender, broker, insurance company. Help staff with different problem and training classes"
bad,Only apply if your have NO other options. 70% employee turnover within the first year of employment. Unethical sales practices are pushed by upper management.
bad,I did not like pushing people to get in front of the Banker.  Even if a customer did not have any cash in their account we had to try and get this same customer in front of the Banker.  We had to meet the monthly requirements of up sales.  Email were received several times daily warning you of dismissal.  This was expected even when you worked the drive thru window.
bad,"not a great place to work, your thoughts and ideas do not count, management is not personable and do not care about what you are doing or how to make yourself better"
bad,"Thoroughly enjoyed building customer relationships and maintaining those relationships currently as well, the company, however, was NOT concerned with customer relations, but more with selling products. Enjoyed working with loans, helping educate customers on credit and what affects it and how to repair and rebuild it as well. (Self Taught)"
bad,"All about them making money. They don't care about customers.  They use tactics to sell products to customers that the customers don't even need and will hurt the customers' credit scores, etc."
bad,"Started out with this company when it was Wheat First Union, then First Union Securities, then Wachovia Securities and finally Wells Fargo Advisors..."
bad,I was a teller here and was there for a short time. I loved working with our customers and with my team. We did all the normal banking functions you would expect from a bank.
bad,I was a contract employee and this was not a permanent position for me. Heavy contact with customers and Loan Officers. Processing loans to submit to underwriting for review.
bad,"Exceptional place to work for, company recognizes there employees.Great place to work for, also fun  and a fast paste environment.the hardest part of my job is fear of robery"
bad,Does not have a true work life balance.  Titles are over inflated or just does not make sense.  Duties for a typical job is broken into pieces amongst several employee's to justify the department existence.
bad,"Could have done a much better job with rescheduled workdays. Working phone or any contact lines on Sundays was not the easiest thing to do, thus my work experience there was indeed brief, since a shift change (asked for ) never occured."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Good company to work for, there's a lot of opportunities at this company. They are a stable financial company that offers their employees a lot of opportunities.."
bad,i loved working here until it went under and everyone lost there job without even knowing. and making everyone just go job less without a notice until they found another job
bad,"Provided excellent customer service"
bad,"Employees were responsible for maintaining a well balanced cash drawer. Conduct accurate transactions for customers based on their needs and the requirements of Wachovia Bank. Service the needs of customers based on the products that are currently on the market. Management was good at the branch, once a steady team was built. I enjoyed working with my manager and all fellow tellers on the teller line. The hardest part of the job was being able to identify sales with clients when the establishment is full of customers. The most enjoyable part of this job was the ability to conduct a large amount of transactions within my cash drawer, and through the vault being the vault teller, accurately."
bad,very precise and pushes for customer satisfaction. plenty of benefits  and community outlets as well
bad,low  pay  for  required  workload  and  too much  micro  management. very little  room  for  career  growth
bad,As a previous World Savings employee it is difficult to positively review the job culture of Wells Fargo simply because it was not customer service base or employee friendly.  I left Wells Fargo because I did not feel was learning and it was clear that growth was not a possibility if I did not follow the culture that I felt was unethical.
bad,"My boss made inappropriate comments and physical contact to me in front of others. He ignored my requests to stop. I filed a formal complaint, but was I never moved to a different work area or otherwise accommodated."
bad,Great company but very strict. I have nothing bad to say about the company I just think that it was not for me.
bad,I worked with great people. however I believed that more attention to detail needed to be provided to customers.
bad,"It's not much I can really say about this one because it was short-lived, I barely remember working here. The best part about learning something is that you will never forget it no matter how long its been. So with that being said even though I do not remember details of this job I remember how to operate in a banking environment. I remember the long nights of balancing and making sure that everything has been accounted for and still today I am like that in my personal life."
bad,it has decent pay and good benefits. the atmosphere is good to work in an it is a some what relaxed floor.
bad,"Management was poor and based their hirings off of language ability rather than aptitude.  The hiring manager passed on someone who graduated from college with a finance degree because she said ""(s)he is a threat to my job."""
bad,"Horrible place to work. Sales are impossible for tellers and if you do make your sales you only get 2$ per sale while a banker can make thousands in one quarter, Keep in mind it is the teller that is doing the actual selling the banker is just finishing up the sale by putting the customer info into the computer. Also management is sooooo far off."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers, although, at times, I didn't feel as though they wanted to open new accounts etc.  They were there to cash a check or do a simple deposit,  The management was constantly changing which I believes that shows the room for growth.  I learned the in and outs of basic banking and my co-workers were there to help."
bad,"my typical day consisted of coming in and just preparing my day, i enjoyed working with all co-workers, and supervisors. i am a all aroungd team player"
bad,"the worst place to work, is all about sales a numbers, they hire managers without training in management just sales"
bad,Fun place to work and they take care of their employees. No one is under compensated and we get bonuses when deserved.
bad,This business was trying to keep the company going while situation of a byout by Wells Fargo.
bad,"Although WF has been around for over a century now, the working atmosphere is somewhat unpleasant--impersonal and extremely ""corporate""."
bad,"worked a lot there, was hard to take time off but compensation was good"
bad,"Update and verify client information in database to ensure accuracy and compliance, audit client  information to ensure conformance to privacy regulation and Wells Fargo’s high security standard."
bad,Worst job I ever had that's why I only stayed for 2 months. Lacked management and very disorganized.
bad,"Little mobility, poor salary, and frequent layoffs. They break several tax laws with their contractors. I was basically a full-time, permanent employee, only with half the pay and no benefits."
bad,I work for Wachovia and was grand father in with Wachovia but when Wellsfargo took over it seem they like to get the old Wachovia peoples that have years out because they don't pay more than Wachovia so on that point. It's no job security with WellsFargo
bad,This was my first business job out of college. It was too much cold calling. Data Entry and analysis are more of my friends. I did manage to create successful sales campaigns but it was work I did not enjoy. The boss was a good guy
bad,Tuition reimbursement was a huge perk. Retail banking is a very annoying position though.
bad,"Working at this company has been a challegene..The hardest part of my job is working with loan officers that are not respectfully. My co-workers and i work as a team. But my job is to service my clients and help them make there dreams come true. What i have learned on my job is breathing and let God run my desk. There should be a balance working for the company and giving good customer service, but when you spend more time having email wars, it makes it hard to be all you can be. At the end of the day its all about Jesus and good customer service"
bad,"Retail banking is a joke! If I didn't leave, I would be stuck in the same job for years! No opportunity for advancement"
bad,Review Book of business with Personal bankers. Working with bank personal along with business bankers. Developing new business through networking and outside associations
bad,"As long as you go into the job knowing that there are sales requirements this is a great job. The support is excellent but the management is stuck-up because they are overpaid and expect you to sell products. They have brain washed to believe they are really helping people, when in reality 90% of the people that entered the bank just want to leave."
bad,Sets up very good platform for financial sales industry. Full opportunity to make bonuses on a quarterly basis.
bad,"horrible internship, use you for free labor, no incentives"
bad,"When I first found out I was getting this job as Wells Fargo, I thought things were looking up. I would have a steady schedule, weekends off and later on found out as a part time teller that I would still have vacation days and benefits. It honestly felt like a dream. But what made the job difficult was how things were being ran. We have a service manager that doesn't realize some rules need to be bent in order to keep customers happy. While there are risks we must watch out for, the fact is in a small town where I am located and well known because I am the closest that lives there should show I know what I am doing when I don't ask a customer for their ID when all they are trying to do is deposit cash in their account. Because of this job, I leave hoping I don't wake up because I fear of becoming unemployed. Because of this job, I have suffered through much substance abuse and still maintained to hold it together at work. If you truly take the time to read this review, all I want is a job where I am in control of helping people the best way they need to be helped. Otherwise, I am going to go insane. This bank shouldn't be a bank anymore and it's high time they get shut down. If you are a local business owner, I would love to sit and talk about what we can do to help your business grow and what I require from this. Which isn't much but to be able to come home and appreciate the life I have. Because that is getting harder to do here at Wells Fargo."
bad,"•	Creating managing and reporting Reverse Logistics Report "
bad,"Pay and benefits were really good.  However, do not ever expect to get breaks.  A lot of times you won't get a lunch either if it's busy.  Management will try to make it up by buying you lunch, but over time it is frustrating when you have to eat behind the teller line and it takes 2 hours to eat because customers keep coming in and you can only take a bite when there isn't anyone in line."
bad,maintaining sale goals nice co workers a lot of micromanaging warm transfers can be very hard too many goals and deadlines
bad,"The thing I liked most about this job is I was able to help people"
bad,"Manage pipeline and assist borrowers with Modifications,Refinance and Purchase of new home. Collect and review all documents and assist under writer with finalization. Adhere to all FDCPA guidelines for all investors. My strong attribute is coaching and developing team members to achieve their goals and productivity. I am very organized and detail oriented. I work well alone or in a team environment."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Wells Fargo is a fast paced sales job which allows personal growth
bad,This is the worst job I have ever had. My manager was a joke she never helped customers only ticked them off and then did not understand why people were leaving our bank and why her employees numbers were down. This is not a banking position it is a used car sales position. If u want to wake up every morning and hate your job then apply to be a personal banker with Wells Fargo.
bad,there is not much room for advancement in Wells Fargo  they ask to much of you with every customer not very many pay raises no support from management however they do have great benefits
bad,"I will not use names because I’m not sure if the review would be flagged"
bad,I was fired from Wells because I called out due to illness was sent a certified letter to my home while I was hospitalized and once I got out of the hospital 3 weeks later I read the letter which also stated that I was no eligible for rehire
bad,I was told I would be hired a full time position and was only scheduled 20 hours or less a week. The atmosphere was good among the staff. My issue was being a part time employee after being told I would be full time. Very misleading
bad,"Although the people are great and doing their best to grow and improve their own lives and that of their families, the immorality and irresponsibility of executive leadership finds its way into every level of this company. There is a reason the U.S. Congress is taking action to correct the behavior of Wells Fargo in ways that haven't been seen in modern history. Hopefully under the watchful eye of Congressional Oversight Committees Wells Fargo can not only move past its immoral business practices, but can do the work necessary to repair some of the damage it has done."
bad,The company has little intention of hiring and keeping employees.  Extremely high turn around. No secret that they don't care about customers or employees.
bad,"Financial Crimes dept is cut throat. Job do not care about family or is illness. You get occurrences for work performance, time away for illness. Job do not have sick time, paid vacation time only PTO time which is hard to use.Management no good pretty much on your own when new updates rolls out. Had the Flu was written up due to company do not accept doctors excuses apply for FMLA only to get denied. Gave 2 weeks notice mgr stated didn't have to work out notice now not eligible for rehire due to job abandonment HR do not care about your two weeks notice."
bad,"Working conditions, benefits and pay are pretty good. Culture in many parts of the company is pretty pleasant as is management. This of course will vary depending on where you are. The hardest part of the job is knowing that you are working for a company that rips people of directly (overdraft fees, discrimination in lending, foreclosures) and finances companies in sectors such as fossil fuels and private prisons"
bad,During my time there I was witness of other employees being logged into customer account looking at private information. When I took this info to HR to have the said employees disciplined for their bad actions it was not handled professionally. We in training with them were told we would be fired on the spot if we were ever in anyone account who was not a customer in front of us. The ladies that were in another employees account while the employee was out were not given any discipline for breaking that rule. I did not want to be apart of that team.
bad,Fun work place with support on the floor to answer any of your questions. The most cultural job that allows you to be who you are with no regrets.
bad,"I really loved my job and the benefits of being a star performer in all business metrics. I was very good at my job, and I truly believed I would retire from there. There was a lot of unethical behaviors streaming down from leadership. Still I remained ethical and a model employee. The sales environment was not just competitive, but cut-throat. Thankfully, I naturally excelled above the expectations, and I was taught and mentored by a admirable and respectable role model. I did what I was taught, by trainers, I reluctantly, went to Human Resources on my District Manager for the unethical behaviors and punishments he would never send by email, only by a phone call. I was getting NO help from Human Resources, and I had done my leg work, I kept record of everything. Regrettably, I ended up leaving the company, when I was 9 months pregnant, my store was at it's monthly plan to hit goal, but we missed our daily checking goal by one, our solutions by 5, and proxy by 400, roughly, and he called and told my team that we would now be joining the other teams from our district that missed their daily plan in an 3 hour call night, to produce sales appointments to make up for our gap. Three months later, he was fired for his unethical standards. Now flash forward, my old store manager tells me how it's changed, and how I should come back. I apply. Hopeful. Excited. I get an automatic email response that my applications will never be considered. WHAT!!! How can I still feel like this is a missing part of my life, and that same company treat a once valued employee so harshly."
bad,"I worked when I had to sell people accounts and I hated it. Other than that it was okay, PTO and pay were okay. I’d work at a bank again. Just not Wells Fargo."
bad,La empresa no se interesa por los empleados ni clientes.
bad,this was a good job all in all but the demands for sales is what ended my working relationship with wells fargo. if you can keep up with the cut throat sales then it is the job for you
bad,Part A claims was a joke. A really high turn over with employees. Grading wasn't realistic. It was a pass or fail system. if you got 99 percent on a claim you failed because it wasn't 100 percent. This made it impossible for anyone to do well. The week I left Wells Fargo another 13 people left that same week. I hear Part A claims still has a high turn over rate.
bad,A typical day at work checking emails doing media recall requests and tape vault rotation. Wells Fargo is a great company to work for I've learned to work with others under pressure. The hardest part of my job is being laid off and the most enjoyable is working with colleges that work as a team.
bad,"performing intermediate duties and support related to branch operational activities and financial services; processes all new account transactions; assisting customers in their selection of various accounts and financial services; cross-selling the Bank's products and services; opening, maintaining and closing of all account types; performing branch clerical duties; promoting business for the Bank by maintaining good customer relations and referring customers to appropriate staff for new services"
bad,"This was a busy call center. Customers are usually irate at wells fargo as a company. They are always training you to either take new customers or new guidelines but you don't get compensated. The head manager never was a customer service representative so she doesnt know what its like to be in our shoes. They say its a customer service job, but are more focused on selling."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Wells fargo when it was Wachovia it use to be a great place to work and production is too high people are scared or nervous about not getting their production and it is not a stable job. Too stressful.
bad,"Position eliminated after 19 years!"
bad,great company to work for. Room for advancement. Flexible schdules. Great management. work hard and you will be promoted. stressful enviroment but not bad.
bad,"At Wells Fargo, each person is valued for individual skills and talents, has the opportunity to fulfill personal ambitions, and contributes to the success of the company. That’s why Wells Fargo provides all eligible regular and part-time team members with a comprehensive set of benefits designed to protect their physical and emotional health and to help them make the most of their financial future. When you’re at your best, so is Wells Fargo. Team members may also participate in a stock purchase plan and receive discounts on financial products, home mortgages, and more. "
bad,33 years of good working experience with Wells Fargo. A very good company to work for. Advancement was great. Good to work full time. Employee benefits is excellent.
bad,"While employed with Wells Fargo we had weekly meetings and sales goal to meet.  If we were unable to meet those sales goals, mgt will require you to stay with little to no warning.  This became a problem and interfered with my 4 year old son and the flexibility of his daycare center."
bad,"Organization is very cost minded where I feel much of the staff did not have adequate tools to do their jobs such as dual monitors. Management was hard to find when looking for additional work direction. Nevertheless, was given a lot of leeway for developing organizational reporting."
bad,"they make you do tasks that are not meant for you to do. tellers take up a lot of stress having to deal with poor management skills, under paid for what they go thru."
bad,"Processing mail "
bad,I had real problems with the company's ethics. Eventually my fears were justified when the company came under intense federal banking and SEC investigation.
bad,"No room for advancement if you start off as a teller, you basically have to be a teller until they ""feel like you have mastered"" the job which could potentially take years to advance."
bad,There is no loyalty..your just there to make the company money your just a number bringing in sales an no reward..numbers are unachievable..most of the management is all about sales..there is always a reason to let you go..again no loyalty
bad,I have no words.  Higher ups need to remove certain management.  Morale is awful in this office.  No real flexibility.  Certain management in the branch can be abusive and unprofessional which is a “open secret”.
bad,"The “unfair sales practices” they were supposed to be getting rid of was instead moved over to their collection hubs. We are pushed to meet numbers, followed by corrective action if not met."
bad,"district and area level management was terrible. company has an inability to see which direction retail banking is heading in the future. not enough opportunities for advancement, do not have good employee development programs."
bad,"Wells Fargo has no moral compass. It preys on its customers in a variety of ways, including opening accounts for the unwary customer, adding features to customer accounts without informing account owners, and lying to regulators. It is a criminal enterprise."
bad,They do not care about you as a person it is so hard to promote I personally feel like my job is not secure I love my team but management is horrible the culture is bad they are very unethical
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,You were basically a sales person there was no customer service involved what so ever all they were worried was how many things you could get a member to have
bad,"Wells Fargo is great if you are looking for old school banking, but their business structure is weak. Lots of people slacking off because of all the bad news it received from the checking account scandal"
bad,worked through a temp agency no work life balance. they do not except doctors excuses if you are sick Temps are held to the same standards as employees with less pay and no benefits. they will put you on mandatory overtime and then change your schedule after you have left for the day so you show up an hour early to work and can't start until you are scheduled.
bad,Mandatory OT has become excessive. I have no time for myself. The pay is lower than other banks and has been that way since the Wachovia / Wells Fargo merger when a lot of people were forced to take pay cuts.
bad,"There is a reason Wells Fargo is consistently in the news. Extremely stressful environment. They run the Home Mortgage division like a plantation. There is no room for growth and the pay is horrible, especially for the amount of stress they put you through. Management style is poor, passive aggressive when communicating with staff and play psychological games with staff. Management will make an error and try to make you believe it was your fault. Management even turn on each other. Never have I ever seen such foolishness."
bad,I had the worst experience working for Wells Fargo Bank. The management was very forceful and manipulative in order for me to open accounts that were not needed for customers. They were corrupt and deceitful. I do not recommend people to work for this kind of establishment
bad,"Horrible place to work , they promise you advancement which is false due to their inconsistency and bad management. Terrible management needs to be fired."
bad,"The fact that you have to live in Arkansas is bad enough. I just didn't get along with a lot of the people there. Many were nice, but some were flat out awful."
bad,"I personally did not enjoy working at Wells Fargo due to the environment, stressors from management, being under paid and a plethora of other reasons."
bad,"It was a okay job, I did learn from that job. Also I did enjoy my co-workers, I learn a lot from them and they were very helpful. I liked my manager he wasn't the best but good. I did not like our lead in our department, she was a mean women she mistreated me and it seem like it was only me."
bad,Cut throat environment...senior managers are out to embarrass front-line managers.  The pay is pathetic and raises extremely negligible.  Might be a good place to start your career but not one for the long term...no work life balance..the company comes first and they didn't care about your family situation. Not a shock that what happened recently in the news happened...opening fictitious accounts etc
bad,"Most enjoyable part of the job is when someone comes to me thanking me for help."
bad,"The pay is not enough for everything you do there. As for as management, hippa laws don't mean anything to them. What ever is said to mangers everyone else always know to"
bad,"I would not recommend this employer for a full time career"
bad,"No one really tells you what to expect! You are tied to a phone, cannot eat or drink at your desk, cannot chew gum, must achieve improbable goals from management that have never manned the phones in their lives. There is no room to grow, and the turn around rate is super high! "
bad,"Don't work here. it literally was the worst job of my life, I developed physical illness because of the way I was treated. they are unethical to say the least."
bad,"a typical day at wells Fargo was very stressful, constantly being yelled at by customers, they say they are flexible with schedules, which is completely false. (I had a second job as a instructor so made most of my money on saturdays and sundays). the most enjoyable part of my day was for my lunch break at the onsite cafeteria"
bad,Stop jumping people as soon as they walk in the door trying to consistently sell them something even though you have known them for 20 plus years and already know they don't want or need anything else
bad,"busy always recruiting. young team with lots of project work."
bad,"sales quotas are really hard to achieve, unrealistic goals. pretty much impossible to attain. management style micromanagement, wouldn't recommend it to anyone.."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,no proper training the expect you to work with equipment that is terrible. Mangement was terrible you where treated like a child. Would never go back to that particular dept.
bad,"Administer interest payment calculation, invoicing and processing. Collection and followup of compliance items. Respond to and/or investigate customer inquiries in a timely manner. Process account terminations and payment of requisitions. Reconcile accounts. Process receipts of wires and disbursements via check or wire."
bad,I work from 8am to 5 pm reviewing loans for modification purposes.
bad,One of the worst bank jobs I have ever experienced. Computers were outdated and even though clients called to reset passwords we still had to sale products to angry clients.
bad,"the customer were great to talk to, didn't learn nothing from management, good co-workers, not a hard job but they want so much from you, branch manager was always in her office never helping out the branhc had the service manager do all the work for her."
bad,This company hires and fires . It is an awsome place if you want to stay in the same job or get promoted and make less money
bad,"Worked for the company before the merger. The company itself is sales driven so if you dont like selling, the company isnt for you. People have been fired for not meeting goals INSTEAD of management providing the necessary skills to be successful. Majority of the people in management have no banking experience, hired right off the street. The people who have worked there for years, who actually deserve these positions are looked over and paid less but are expected to train the newbies. What a slap in the face. Promotions are based on who you know and who you are sucking up to...not what you know or performance. Think long and hard before accepting a position (if it involves sales) at this company. Too many other banks with less goals and better benefits."
bad,"Just another bank. You are a number, and they really do not care for numbers"
bad,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for but some people abuse  the power they have.
bad,I assisted customers with deposits and upselling them new products.
bad,I would not recommend working at this company to anyone. Their benefits are not good the policy to escalate you right out the door and there is room from advancement. 
bad,Great banking products.
bad,A typical day at work involves harrassing customers and trying to force products down their throats by any means necessary. Extreme micromanagement and a culture of fear.
bad,Providing customers with financial benefits such as helping them succeed financially
bad,"I would get my money drawer and get all the items I needed to help the customers. I made deposits, with drawls and all other transactions needed . I learned that I needed to be shown how to do the work needed to be done not told that I should know how it was to be done. Management was never available when needed. My co workers were not helpful, and wanted my assistance when I was busy and then told I was not doing my job. Understanding how the process of doing the job was accomplished was the hardest part with no hands on training. Talking to the customers was really enjoyable"
bad,"This employer is only concerned with making the bank money. They do not care about the employees health or well being, all they want is for you to meet your sales goals and work 50 hours a week 6 days a week to make that happen."
bad,"Receive loans to work on and get ready for closing "
bad,"The company seems to be more concerned with moving resources to India then actually improving the processes first. Without having a firm grasp of the issues with the current processes, you will just further exacerbate the problem by moving it to a different country and culture, which then presents its own set of unique problems."
bad,Less workers to work more and more dwindling staff. Same old same old just worse. They were busted for creating accounts but there was a lot more worse
bad,"The culture is horrible. District managers are not aware of how the world is changing and are still under pressure from board of directors. Lack of work life balance, although they say that is a priority. Working for Wells Fargo in the bay area is an absolute horrible experience. TURNOVER IS INSANE, lack of coaching and everyone moves up so fast because they are scared to lose a person, yet lack the experience. DON'T DO IT. There are still a lot of team members who are known, even by leadership to be ""gaming"" despite the lawsuits. When you bring it up to the district managers attention you are looked at and treated as a whistle blower and they make an effort to downplay the situation."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Love the work but management in my area needs to be trained and not think outside the box.  Also in my are management likes to micromanage.  Although I have been here for a long time it is almost impossible to be promoted or advance with the company.  They expect you to be apart of different groups and activities but no recognitions or support for management or Sr. Management.
bad,Wells Fargo is not a good place to work. This company does not care about its customers or its employees. You can look up many news articles online to see how poorly this company was treating people during my tenure.
bad,"If you  are going to apply think twice before you do, you are told many promises and good things however there is no follow through on the promises, turn over rates are very high and very consistent"
bad,"One of the worst companies you can work for. The company is a complete mess, from management to HR and problems with ancient technology. The workload is insane, and the company is under so much pressure from regulators, the media and members of Congress, that they create more work because they are unable to formulate a strategy for resolving the problems. For some reason, the department that we work in hires a number of inexperienced young people, who have no management skills to speak of. Your success at this job, solely depends on who your manager is. If you care about your career, do not accept a job with Wells Fargo."
bad,Very difficult to generate new business with the tainted name.Management is all over the place with their requirements.  Leadership is horrible.  NO clear direction.
bad,"I got sold during the interview and now I regret it. Don’t work there, at least as an HMC Home Mortgage Consultant. They don’t even let you take your breaks and lunches. I’m sick of this place!"
bad,I enjoyed my time with this company as an employee but the systems are very dated compared to other banks which customers have problems with. Good benefits & pay but management should listen to their employees more about suggestions for customer service to be better.
bad,Management sucks. Company was designed to favor management and no one to truly voice your concerns to. Great company but bad experience based on how horrible my manager is
bad,"I worked in Default Servicing of Home Mortgage for over five years.  The company continuously put profits over quality, and management often massaged negative findings to keep good relations with other business lines.  To management, it was more important to keep the company looking good rather than acknowledge shortcomings or flaws in process.  Few employees are allowed telecommuting options and there is overtime that is implicitly mandatory."
bad,They are not employee focused at all. They set very high and most times unrealistic goals with no incentive pay or promotion when goals are met. The benefits are awful.
bad,"Terrible workplace culture. They don't care about the employees. It's all about the company and not much about the employees. They don't care if you have a flat tire, you better show up to work or you will get a write up."
bad,There was no opportunity for professional growth or moving up. The company had unrealistic goals for employees during the time I worked there which was exactly during the time the scandal of fake accounts came out.
bad,There is no chance to advance my career and no projects available to me to participate with. I would only suggest WFA if you are not looking to work on your career development.
bad,"WF leaders not interested in using latest big data tools to fast track development process. It all Old School Java code like other IT shops. "
bad,I previously worked for this company and do not care to share anymore information about this company. Please do not ask for anymore information as I am not willing to provide it.
bad,It was my experience that the Team leader was tasked with 90% of the work while management worried about what was coming from above. The Team leads really drove the success of the team - not management.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Poor management . Manditory overtime that they forced you to get rid of. Manager dictating what you could eneter on facebook. Manager encouraging office gossip
bad,"Not the best bank to work at. There were a lot of sales goals and pressure to make fake accounts to meet daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly goals. I do not recommend."
bad,"Culture and management do not provide a positive environment.  "
bad,Wells Fargo loan processing guidelines are very strick and require a lot of unnecessary documents from the customer making the home loan process very unpleasant for the customer.
bad,"Wells Fargo Boise Service Center contracted all their security to a contractor. G4S Secure Solutions was the security contractor for Wells Fargo. At the job site there exists lots of back-biting, gossip and cut throat activities which threatened all security officers. It was a very toxic environment to work in and at. I liked all our contract security agents and I manage to try and get along with Wells Fargo employees. Wells Fargo found another Security Contractor and we were all let ago after over 4 years of service."
bad,not a friendly place to work they say we have to have sales still and after all the information on the media they want us to rebuild trust with customers
bad,"I worked there for 12 years with very minimal advancement. management was horrible and reported to HR multiple times by multiple employees for multiple different reasons and nothing was done. if you work there, you feel like you're working in a cult."
bad,"Constant require for sales and solutions."
bad,"This place only cares about the most productivity they can squeeze out for the least amount of money. Then they'll hire outsiders for tens of thousands more. You'll be paid 80% of the midpoint and get a 2% raise on the sub-standard pay. The management at a all levels has no education to speak of, they only favor your ability to engage in political games."
bad,"Too many managers who have never actually performed the tasks they are managing. "
bad,"Did you have a successful quarter? Good for you, now we will shift your goals so you don't get a bonus next quarter. Do you want to apply for a corporte training program to become an analyst? Cool, your boss has to sign off on it and since his bonus depends on your performance, he will never do that."
bad,"I do not work at WF, they sold the Insurance Division to USI. "
bad,This company has influenced their growth by having agents do shady practices to earn accounts and sales. This company never tried to work with me only the associates that were closer to the race of the management.
bad,"I liked the customer interaction and the fast paced environment, but I did not like the sales culture at the time.  Management was focused on daily sales goals and often times would encourage tactics that were not always beneficial to the customer.  "
bad,There is too much favortism and not enough room for advancement. The management was not very proactive in letting me know what I can do to be better in the field. It sucked having to go through tons and tons of envelopes all day just to shred them. I hated it!
bad,Management wants you to sale products to customers when they do not have a need for it. Sales are the only thing that the company cares about. You do not receive raises and the goals for commission are increasingly harder every year.
bad,"You work very hard for a company and there is no loyalty towards the employee. Management was not organized, scheduling was not organized. Very unfair towards job/ life balance."
bad,not a good environment to work in. pressure alot of pressure. even though they say there are no more sales goals there are. typically open acts all day long
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"If you have kids, not a friendly family oriented job. You are only allowed so many days off if your kid is sick. More for people with kids in their teen years that can stay home if sick."
bad,"I ENJOYED WORKING FOR Wachovia , prior to Wells Fargo taking over. Wachovia was a employment friendly and people. Once Wells Fargo took over, things quickly changed. We were told what to say and had to say it verbatim on the phone. We could not be ourselves to assist the customer."
bad,"horrible management, sales goals pressure to the point where employees felt the need to go against their ethics, i resigned before going against my ethics"
bad,"fortunate enough to have a great 1st level manager, however serious concerns around higher level leaders of the organization particularly from an ethical behavior perspective"
bad,My experience with Wells Fargo was one that I would not wish upon anyone. The day to to day was not bad but you get treated poorly by customers and employees and managers. My managers were more focused on fashion and how they looked rather than doing their jobs correctly. They couldn't be bothered to get up off their cell phones to give approvals or meet new banking clients without throwing you shaded looks. Employees were so focused on drama that there would have to be meetings surrounding it and nothing ever got resolved. The amount of laziness that was inside my branch was ridiculous. If you want a job that you like and want to keep- I suggest NOT working for Wells Fargo.
bad,worked in home preservation management is clue-less pay they keep cutting making bonus none existent keep raising the bar so no one can hit bonus and if you don't  hit bonus three months in a row they find a way to fire you management is about how much you can kiss ... is not about the knowledge they go through supervisor on daily basis can keep any of the good ones they all quit is a shame is run so poorly
bad,"Wells fargo played with too many people's money and time and used people,which all involved should be getting some serious prison time."
bad,"These people want you stay and work the same job forever. Good work is never appreciated, and there's tons of pressure about sales. You literally have to harass customers in order to save your own job."
bad,"I was with this company for years, and they fired me for low production levels that were not being held with all other employees. its great to have an employee loyal to the company they say; however, the company is not very loyal to the employee."
bad,"I was employed between 2009-2011 in the Foreclosure Department<"
bad,"Again, as a contractor with no vacation, sick time or Holiday pay.  Lack of training people and communicating with employees. Not worth driving all the way to Minneapolis with a low wage."
bad,Do not pay tellers enough for the responsibility that you have in cash handling. Typically did not get 40 hours in the work week.  Few breaks and short when you did get them.
bad,"I was a contractor at first they were great to work for. I was then let go according to them because I called in to many time. I called in once. I called in to get my daughter admitted into the hospital for Rsv, pneumonia, and Afluenza. They called me and told me I was terminated for calling in. I asked that they review my record again because that day is the only day I called in. I received a phone call that they stated I was right but unfortunately they were to slow to bring me back. I found this to be shocking and very wrong. So would I tell someone else to work there and they are good people. No. I do know direct employees from there who also have said they have to walk on egg shells. It's a shame."
bad,since all there financial problems they cant still get there act together  management changes every day what's good in the morning is changes by the end of day they throw all employees under the bus is free for all they promised employees changes is all lies
bad,its not that good of a company they use they're employees as Proust mangers are biased in who they promote now is this suffice for me to go forward.
bad,"Working at Wells Fargo can be a challenge, however working hard and being a self starter at wells fargo can prove to be a benefit for an individual looking to grow in the banking industry."
bad,"When I started the company was Wachovia, soon after there was a merger. Now Wellsfargo. Department was completely changed. Not for the better. Wellsfargo increased volume but not number of  employees. They tried to do more with less people. Also benefits were reduced or taken completely away. Turnover rate became higher and higher."
bad,They were a good contracting company. The recruiters were friendly and they paid adequately. There is not a whole lot to say about them.
bad,Everyday they put so much pressure on the employees to constantly open accounts while trying not to sound like a robot. The thing I enjoyed was the relationships I build with customers.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Need to clean house on management they are overpaid and do not listen to the employees. Does not pay to do a fantastic job when they don't appreciate hard work and prefer inadequate employees overall.
bad,"when i first began my employment things were fun, and exciting. they actually cared about their employee's. as time went on they began to show less and less favor, and began implementing the ""whip"" technique which ultimately lowered employee moral and confidence. the only way to get any kind of recognition is to sleep with your hierarchy or befriend them in a way that is truly immoral. im glad to have left."
bad,"The company had too many goals that were impossible to meet!"
bad,"Working for Wells Fargo customer service is the most draining job you can ever have. They monitor your breaks and if you're 30 seconds late you're in trouble. They want you to help the customer but get them off the phones. They contradict everything they put in place. I would not recommend this department to anyone. Especially the Frederick, MD site."
bad,"Company provides a good training, and focuses on providing a good customer service. Co workers were friendly and always willing to help and train a new employee."
bad,"Unrealistic sales goals, not much work life balance, compensation is not where it should be. Management does not take into consideration their employees feeling or ideas. Very one sided, it is all about the sales goals and not about what is really best for the customer. They put way too much on service managers and lead tellers, while they also expect them to help customers, help other tellers and make the sales goals for the day which are not realistic."
bad,"While I loved what I did at Wells, and the people that I helped every day, the culture and management are lacking. I was there over a year with no job advancement, and no opportunity for it. The sales goals and requirements are very aggressive, and almost pushy to the customers."
bad,I believe employees were stressed and working under duress to make selling points. The manager was a micromanager and always concern about cross-selling products. The need to charge unwarranted fees to customers especially when they were non-coustomers.
bad,"If you've ever looking for a bank job do you usually notice wells fargo is always hiring? Why do you think that is? Because people hate working here. A typical day at wells fargo is you get into to work, your manager asks you how many solutions you are planning to get (solutions are sales). The sucky part about this is that most products at wells fargo suck. If you don't do these the managers are trained to insult you and compare you to other tellers so it can motivate you to be better. Then if you are a teller you getting 11.33 a hour (it's not that much after taxes trust me you'll be making anout 650 if you're full time). Everyday for over two years that I worked here I hate myself when I came home. Oh amd if they tell you there's room to grow in the company it's a lie."
bad,not for everyone... not for anyone.. very difficult to advance and you are non stop micromanaged
bad,"I wouldn't suggest working for this company if you have strong ethics. I've worked at 2 different locations as a personal banker and each one being the same if not worse. The company is so focused to meet sales goals that they don't care how you do it. Push, push push until the customer says yes. And even if you did absolutely great with a customer and the customer states that there is always something you missed and should've sold to them and your manager makes it known. If you have a family also this is not the company for you. Pay is very poor and as is management. They say they are very family oriented but it's the absolute opposite. I've seen other staff not be able to get the day off to go to a close relatives funeral as well as for a sick kid in the hospital. If you don't have a family, you enjoy working from 8:30-7:00 and you don't care how you get your sells even if its being a dirty sells person then you'll love the company."
bad,If you can sell you will go places. You have goals and if you do not meet them your gone.
bad,company that you will put time into and all they will care about is their bottom line
bad,In Training since day one which only included 3 weeks of actual one on one training but was not able to do any real test cases to show my experience in mortgage underwriting.
bad,"okay place to work, "
bad,"Wells Fargo has poor management skills and will often alienate employees who don't fit their mold. A typical day included feeling like a worm not worthy to have a job. Switching back in forth between English and the very little Spanish I know, which sometimes resulted in customer upsets. Customers that had been used to seeing the same employees for years and were upset that there were new employees that didn't know their every transaction need before even being introduced. There was a push to sell sell sell and out beat other branches in the area. The management is poorly trained and more concerned with how they feel about you then they are with the job you are doing. They like to conduct meetings in which they force you to talk about your personal life."
bad,"A lot of changes, especially back and forth, and inconsistency daily, sometimes throughout the day. Made it difficult to reach normally attainable goals. I worked 2nd shift, which I learned I did not enjoy. Management did not always work together and also very inconsistent with memos. I enjoyed the co workers and relaxing break room areas the most."
bad,"I enjoyed working with the clients but the bank I worked at had poor management! I worked whenever I was needed but was not appreciated and I had to ask for help because I wasn't offered help! I was thrown into working at the drive-up on a Friday which was the 1st of the month after working 4 hrs. in a in-store window!! Because of my family ties with Wells Fargo I was expected to do as well as they did BUT they'd had several years experience and I was a new hire with no banking experience!!  We took quarterly compliance tests but they were not enforced at our location! I volunteered, came in early, filled in wherever needed and really wanted to do well BUT from talking and watching other locations I knew I was working in the wrong place!!"
bad,Wells fargo was not a comfortable place to be employed. The stress level was extreme with reaching goals and management was not supportive of employee issues.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"A typical day at work would begin with a morning meeting with the manager of the branch asking each banker to discuss their set appointments, and the number of sales that would be generated from those appointments.  If a banker didn't have at minimum four appointments that would generate at least nine in core sales, then the banker would be forced to make cold-calling phone calls to fill the pipeline for appointments for the week.  "
bad,"My time at Wells Fargo was not very enjoyable. I meet great people, however the lack of compensation for the work and production that you were expected to produce was not enjoyable. Not a lot of leadership from management or supervisors."
bad,The company only cares about shareholders. No room for growth.
bad,"Performed a wide range of business-related tasks including creating proposals and PowerPoint presentations, answer high volume of incoming calls and in-person inquiries from clients and colleagues, coordinated meeting schedules, process incoming mail and checks, compile daily production statistics and other reports. Support Vice President in areas of calendar management, travel arrangements and document preparation (Excel spreadsheets, correspondence and merged mailings)."
bad,"Analyzed risk potential and made sound leading judgments on mortgage, home equity loans, automotive loans, unsecured loans and investments"
bad,"Wells Fargo has a great benefits, but the pay could be better especially knowing how much other institutions pay their employees and also management could be better. At a certain branch employees get talked to like dogs and customers are treated like they’re a nuisance, even after employees have quit due to treatment HR and the head managers have never done anything about it and don’t care to."
bad,After 25 years at working at Wells Fargo I was sadly let go after I made a mistake. I had no support from anyone which was always the case at Wells Fargo. They are too big to care about any specific employee and they have a bunch of men in suits making decisions and not regarding people as human beings. Don't waste your time. They have zero loyalty.
bad,"- Zero work-life balance"
bad,"The best part about my job is benefits, paid holidays, and PTO. I feel that the managers need more training and help organizing there team. Just seems like, we are always starting over with a new manager and you feel lost."
bad,Upper management was very controlling and manipulative In the Home Equity division. They Never really told the employees the truth of what was happening until things got really bad!
bad,"My manager was fantastic.  However,  overall,  the management were 20 something cliques who were more interested in who was sleeping with who than attending to thier duties.  It could be a great company to work for if it was a more professional environment."
bad,This is a great job for someone with no kids and no outside life. Typically you would work 8-5 everyday full time hours. They want you to go above and beyond without proper pay. No sick days are offered . lawsuits after lawsuits for unethical behaviors....They dont care about employees at all.
bad,"Lately I’ve noticed that the managers care more about you leaving for breaks on time is WAY more important than getting the work done.  They also impose impossible standards and make it beyond difficult to achieve them, yet the workers get blamed for not achieving the impossible standard that was set.  And if you apply for a promotion, the person with the longest time at the company will get the position regardless if they’re qualified or not."
bad,"This company has no advancement, they treat you like kids, managers are always micro-managing you to death. Very stressful job. This job need to be work from home."
bad,Numbers are all that matters. The company doesn't care about their employees or customers. They promote from with in. High turn over and burn out rate.
bad,The Atlanta lockbox has no room to grow into a career. All of the management teams between ALL shifts are super unprofessional. They compete between the shifts and treat their employees horribly. Your also are forced to work long hours and never know what time you will get off. You do receive PTO but good luck getting any of your days approved. Overall I wouldn’t recommend this job
bad,"Wells Fargo used to be okay to work for. Get promoted in retail banking, just know you’ll be expected to do so much more for no compensation. All the branch managers are still standing from the “old days” meaning they don’t do anything, the only ones who work super hard are the service managers. Raising your hand to HR like they preach is a huge lie since HR doesn’t do anything, & bonuses have gotten worse as the years go by. They need to get it together, especially for what they pay their employees."
bad,Wasn't an ideal workplace for me. Sales were extremely aggressive and almost unattainable. There wasn't much room for growth and advancement within the company.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"The job was easy but the people were hsrd. My branch and many I was ""loaned"" to were chopped full of favorites and little room to grow. I have more tha 10 years in customer service and management with a degree in human resources but a women woth 1 year work experience got a promotion due to a n point system only my branch had. It is a nasty work environment unless you know who's rear to kiss."
bad,i do not recommend working here workplace culture is stressful the hardest part about the job is no support from senior leaders when dealing with any issues
bad,"This company is horrible to work for. There is little room for advancement and when there is it’s still very much a ‘boys club’ ( even the women in upper management) mentality. I have seen women running entire districts by them selves, not getting paid for it and get passed over for someone they hired three years before that. I myself required to wear many hats and was the only banker in my location doing 2 other jobs outside of my own and was paid significantly less then my male"
bad,"Great people to work with and always high on opportunities to get promoted or make extra bonus, Managers are driven to promote within circle of trust not necessary best person for the job"
bad,"My Branch Manager was Amazing, but the operational Manager did not have and professional skills and took everything personal."
bad,"The most suitable individuals to be working in the offices of Wells Fargo are those who have no social life, fine with working 45-50 hours a week on a regular basis, and, most importantly, you have no personal attachment to your performance on the job--absolutely no ounce of pride in your work ethic whatsoever."
bad,The only thing good about this job was the pay. They didn’t always give you your raise when it was due and you were never back paid. You get occurrences for your performance and also if you have kids and they get sick this is not the place to work. They expect you to tolerate disrespect on the phone and if you hang up you get a automatic zero and termination. New policies every other day and management expects you to figure it out on your own til the team meeting. If you have anxiety or some don’t prepare to get it from this employer. I was perfectly normal til I started working here. But the good thing about it is that other employers know how stressful this job is so if you can deal with Wells Fargo your basically a shoe in for any other job.
bad,"Cant rate overall company as an FTE.  Contractors are limited to information even if it relates to your job.  24 month max hire period .  Although the department  EIT has mostly virtual teams you must live near a hub even though you do not go into the office.  All other Wells Organizations do not have this rule for virtual teams.   Expectation is to work only 40 hours because OT is frowned upon, attend meetings and fulfill a 40 development in Agile hours."
bad,"Although the free coffee was nice, not have the flexibility to work remotely posed difficulties especially with bad weather. Contractors are not treated as equals because they are not included in the regular town hall meetings and are not taken into consideration for all sorts of things even though they are doing the same job as a Full Time Employee"
bad,"Managers hire their friends, rather than promoting or hiring from outside the organization.  Skills are not upgraded or taught, knowledge is not shared, employees are under-utilized,  but they claim to be swamped with work (while they read books most of the day)."
bad,They hire large groups of employees at once and then fire them all after the 6 month contract is up.  Hired twelve of us at one time and did not keep a single one past 9 months.
bad,"I did not approve of the things that were going on within the work place. It had decent benefits, but that was all. The push to meet quota was so high and caused a lot of pressure"
bad,Low salaries and Impossible to make commission. Company stopped giving bonuses and raises our sales goals to where it was impossible to make commission.  No overtime ever given.  Constantly changing of leadership.
bad,"A typical day does not allow for the caseloads assigned to be set-up, researched and responded to appropriately and thoroughly leading to continual angry recontacts by the customers. "
bad,This is a good starting job if you want to get your foot in the door in the banking industry but get some experience and get out as soon as you can! As a teller you work your butt off everyday and you get little recognition from management.
bad,I have worked for several years and saw many people promoted over things they later got sued for. Now the company wants to take a completely different approach and turn things around for our customers. Wells Fargo care for Wells Fargo and Wells Fargo only. They are ultimately a business and stands by that. They treat very poorly their employees. Not sure if its an overall company wide issue but definitely where I have worked for the past 5 years. Its been a who you know and who likes you type of environment in order to get promoted. So much unfairness. The lead teller role  is full of tasks including manager tasks without a good pay.
bad,"Responsibilities included: providing remote assistance for Wells Fargo’s Commercial Electronic Office Platform® consisting of more than forty products and applications used by small to mid-size businesses in streamlining the deposit and transfer of funds to employees, vendors, and regulatory authorities."
bad,"too much pressure to make unrealistic goals. If you cant hit it, you have to ask your friends and family or go out to different businesses to find more people to sell to."
bad,Too many managers with different opinions of acceptable. No 2 offices have the same performance requirements. Some managers insists that employees spend too much time trying to do the dealerships job (to meet loan approval stipulations). Willing to do business with customers known to having committed fraud.
bad,The company is okay to work for especially if it's an entry level job for a college student right out of school. Upper and lower management all need to take a step back and look at the vitals of the company. Employees are not satisfied in every aspect especially when it comes to financial matters. Employees are petrified to speak out due to the fear of being terminated. Customers need to be a primary focus in this company and it definitely is not the focus. There is a quiet tale of investors being the primary importance and customers are second. A shaking of this company is needed and hopefully it happens soon!
bad,"Unfortunately the management at Wells Fargo did not understand the magnitude of on-line documentation that already resided in their internal database. After hiring me, the management realizing the tasks were already complete and had to let me go."
bad,I felt the company was not orginazed.  It was only a select group that had access to company provided.  I worked with very nice and fair people.  I enjoyed going to work everyday and enjoyed the position I had with Wells Fargo.
bad,"Was not a good transition. They had a messy transition and a lot of people left company. "
bad,The work environment is very stressful. Everyone is very high school and plays favorites. The work load is high. They make you feel undervalued. They should pay more.
bad,"This is for someone who wants a start into a workforce not a career."
bad,"Competitive stressful and no fun! Manager would make you stay late to make sure you hit you sales number for the day, and no work life balance  not worth it."
bad,The environment was stressful with hard to reach sales goals that were heavily pushed. The management was disorganized and often played favorites between employees.
bad,"so, "
bad,I worked in a piloted call center program that was trying build its own brand within the company to possible be used as a set way to conduct the new way the company would sell it's personal loans and lines of credit.
bad,Overall the years company has gotten worse and worse.  Constant meetings and at most companies the sales team is the focus as that what drives the business.  Here that was not the case.  Management has a take it or leave it style which leaves a very poor attitude and work environment
bad,"Hired for one job then after a year the job was dissolved and a new one created doing the same thing with a 30 percent pay cut. Very poor manager/supervisor communication.  Pay raises were pathetic. Was fortunate to leave before the company lost it's reputation, (they incentivized their employees to commit fraud). "
bad,Management and Lending Officer would over look blatant fraud and would punish any one who attempted to SAR any loans. Used threats of termination and intimidation to control individuals.
bad,"I worked there for over 13 years and got displaced. They didn’t even try to move me to another team even with all my experience. They hired younger, cheaper people. "
bad,Managed a pipeline of 100 mortgage accounts through the loss mitigation process. Learned policy and procedures from the Mortgage Loan modification program.
bad,I had a growing family at the time and they wouldn't work with me through my pregnancy and appointments. This location was open on Saturdays from 9am to 2pm. There was at least 7 tellers here but I was asked to work 4 out if 5 Saturdays and I was the only one with a new born. I left and took a better position for myself and my family with more flexible hours.
bad,"I used to love my job with Wells and the management teams. The last year I was there was a pure nightmare, The great managers were let go, they stripped us of our monthly incentive and gave us 5 times the work to do and turned our department into a call center. the new managers for my team were horrific and demoralizing. I have never felt more abused in my life and unimportant."
bad,"Answering inbound calls, taking alarms, making outbound calls for alarms and support issues.  The diversity of the company is amazing but its not what you know.  Some Wells Fargo people just don't care.  Dealing with difficult co-workers who don't seem to mind watching everyone else working.  The most enjoyable part of job is the team work which a majority of the people have."
bad,"Wells Fargo was an ok place to work. If you have great co-workers it can be fun. They are super strict about ""staying in your place"" while working. They have unrealistic goals when you first start out. The environment is stuck up and cut-throat. I had a poor experience due to my manager and the constant degrading that I received if I wasn't up to their standards."
bad,"I have learned a lot but I feel like my morals are compromised so this isn't where i want to go. "
bad,"After being sued for business practices, the company made it hard to enjoy work. Employees are scared into making sure they dont lose their job even though the company does nothing to protect their employees."
bad,Had a fantastic experience working at Wells Fargo.  Top producer that allowed me to grow my business in a fun and productive environment.  No leads provided and no branch provided for me to work out of.  All business was self-sourced
bad,"Typical day at work: Project Manager hasn't a clue."
bad,"* Evaluated various commercial loans."
bad,hired as part time worked an average of 45 hours per week. understaffed. sales was a joke. Expectations were unrealistic. management was breathing down your back 24/7
bad,"The atmosphere is based on high sales and pushes credit cards and more accounts that people do not need. I enjoy sales but not the kind that actually are hurting people and stress you out. To be fair, if you can get past doing that then this is a great place to work and you will advance quickly. Management rides you every day about sales. Hardest part of the job was keeping an eye out for scams as they happen daily. Most enjoyable was the office hours."
bad,"If you have problems, they don't do anything about it. You will just have to suck it up and deal with it or quit. It was great at first, but it ends.."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Management did not advocate for top performers to be considered for advancement as part of salary was commission and managers collect off of their staff bonus incentives so do not want to let them go. Pick from middle of the staff performers. Management slacks on leadership responsibilities hollering across cubicles demands at staff.
bad,"is who you know, not your work quality and efforts. WF makes their employees wait a year before any promotions that seems very unfair because some employees truly need an advancement"
bad,"In the morning, they have huddles about what is going with changes based on operations and any updates. Management is horrible. As bankers, you have to lobby lead, opening doors for customers and greet them as they walk in and out. You get pay on customer service survey score which is barely a hundred dollars and no sales goal no commission."
bad,Wells Fargo claims to be all - Inclusive but that's not totally true.. The culture has gotten worse since all the law suite. The moral is down and the stress levels are at an all time high
bad,it is very difficult to be promoted up unless you know someone in the position that you are applying for I loved the people I worked for and I liked the amount of days we got paid time off for. we did a lot for the community and that is one of the reasons I stayed for the amount of time I did.
bad,"I was a former employee in Philadelphia and the hours are longer than what they originally tell you.  Turnover is high, because people are constantly leaving, either due to being terminated or leaving voluntarily.  Some managers are very good, but others are horrible.  One good thing is you can listen to music while you work.  I wouldn't recommend this job if you want to have a life, because the hours are very long."
bad,"Was laid off from a position that was created 5 months later. Instead of doing the right thing in its efforts to reduce staff, Wells attempted to run employees off instead (Mortgage position) While in the banking center, the manager ran the unit as a dictatorship. Rudest manager I have ever worked for. Despite cries from staff to executive management/HR, the valid complaints went unnoticed. Pressured to sales multiple products despite a lack of interest from clients"
bad,"Don't work for Wells Fargo!  I got sucked in when it was Norwest and it was an awesome company at that time.  Ever since Wells Fargo took over, there is no loyalty or camaraderie at all.  The insurance benefits are very expensive and cover nothing.  The pay is decent but not worth the treatment employees endure.  Management is horrible in every department I've worked and they do not care about employees or their well being."
bad,"Please dont work for wells fargo unless they hire you directly threw the company "
bad,"systems and process are not efficient. Overloaded with files you can't possibly get done. High stress environment, overtime required and lay off employees easily"
bad,"I have spent over 25 years in banking with primarily four employers during that time both in Arizona and in California.  I have to say with complete honesty and sorrow that Wells Fargo Bank was the worse employer I ever worked for.  The Bank's culture is cut throat and as an employee there is no teamwork between departments or divisions.  In retrospect, it is no surprise to me now as I look back at the time I was employed by Wells Fargo that the bank is in the trouble they are now in.  The push to book accounts and ""make"" business was paramount in every manager's agenda.  Leaving there was the best decision I ever made and I have absolutely no regrets about leaving.  I only wish I would have done is sooner."
bad,Management is a joke and don't take anyone seriously. They offer higher positions and then take them back. Wells Fargo policy is all messed up and no customers trust this company.
bad,"Basically it, management downgrades you, horrible company to work for, I'm sorry for myself wasting 1 year and a half of life there. Empty promises. Above all no morals there."
bad,"I have been at WF for 27yrs my original job was outsourced and I lost my very good paying salary, they did nothing to help you get a job or just transfer you to another dept. there is absolutely no help from management. The pay is very bad and the raises are null and void. Not easy to get another job in other depts."
bad,"Sales Pressure galore. Constant adjustments made to better client experience however, it was always a different interpretation on how to get things done per whoever your superior was. There is absolutely no work/life balance and to get PTO approved, you had to jump through 10 rings of fire, chew and swallow glass bits, and run 3 laps around the globe in 5 minutes."
bad,Working as a Teller you hold a large responsibility of providing great customer service to all customers. You must be able to take direction in the middle of a transaction with out mistake.
bad,"Wells Fargo was one of the worst jobs I have ever had. The upper management was horrible, did not know sales from a hole in the ground, and encouraged some practices that were inscrutable."
bad,"Insurance Agent Representative"
bad,"The company has a very tough culture. I'm not sure people enjoy coming to work and feel appreciated, acknowledged and rewarded. Signs of fear, domination,and intimidation are might exist. Creativity, productivity and thinking outside the box and flourished is tough to achieve being under the gun"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Don't work here unless its your last result the time goes by so slow and it feels like youre doing some type of jail time instead of it being your job
bad,"""Culture"" and management need considerable improvement.  Micro-management is the worst.  Company can do so much better."
bad,Constant treats and embarrassment for more production. Unrealistic goals.  Poor compensation and management. Negative atmosphere.
bad,"Company is very behind technology their systems are awful, this makes your work day unproductive and frustrating. The company does not provide the right systems, they are stuck on the old ways of doing things. Management is there but doesn't have leadership skills to lead the team to find better ways of doing things, your opinions don't matter, you are not included on meetings or any projects (if they even are working on any). Totally would not recommend this place to anyone, not sure about how other departments within the company are but Lending Operations is totally awful and disorganized."
bad,Job is all about selling products/ services to ever caller.  Supervisors listen to your call and pull feedback out of their butt of how it is ultimately the way you handled the call that you received a no when you asked the caller if you can share a service with them.
bad,"I do not like working here very unorganized, you switch teams too much, and they are all over the place. very unorganized the training is not that great they don't really explain in detail."
bad,I have never heard good things about Wells Fargo and they did not disappoint. I was a Home Loan Processor for the Refinance Department and within 3 days you were already receiving files. I had no experience going into this role and felt completely in the dark. My knowledge of the process was self taught and their only form of training was for you to ask a lot of questions. This job is far to complex to just perform and fail. Was terminated 7 months later due to not performing the job well... hmm I wonder why??! Filed complaints against my manager. Highly recommend you do not apply for a position unless you're completely desperate like I was.
bad,Management does not care about the employees that work for them. Wells Fargo would try and move looan closings to avoid having to pay our bonuses.
bad,"Terrible pay, decent benefits, terrible management & very hard to get promotions or raises unless company is desperate & has no other option.  High turn over due to terrible work environment."
bad,"Not what I expected with the Data Governance organization.  Micromanagement, and being forced to sit in conference room all day with manager were very routine."
bad,"Strict management, high turn over. In the 3 years that I moved to the  DE office, management and team turn over was at 100%. While out on leave due the the depressed nature of the work environment, they filled my position. Not supportive at all."
bad,Wells Fargo is an extremely poorly run company. It is extremely demanding with very little to no pay-off. Their pay is sub-par and their benefits are poor.
bad,You will hate your life while working here. Your are given monthly goals that become harder and hard to achive due to them constantly changing the rules on you. You will be given new tasks to complete prior to every being given clear instustions on it.
bad,Management don't care bout workers. They took holidays away from us. The sales goals got really horrible and they started wanting us to get our customers credit cards that they couldn't afford financially
bad,"Unprofessional workplace - was not properly managed; for example, new tellers were once left alone while the store mgr, service mgr, and 2 other trained tellers left to go shopping at a store down the street from the bank (the store had a 'sale' they all had to check out). There was always ""drama"" - much tension between the lead tellers, bankers, store mgr, and service mgr - and us tellers 'felt it' and had to 'deal with it'. New hires/tellers (like myself) were not told or given proper information upon hiring - ex: how to properly open the bank. I had no idea the process of entering/opening bank until I got yelled at by the mgr for leaving my car one a.m. before I was to. No one told me other security issues either, until it was time for SOCR. Then I was required to study and know all. Wells Fargo is also more concerned with making tellers ""sell"" products, new accts, etc to customers rather than just take care of what the established customers want - a quick, precise, friendly transaction for the banking need they came in for. It's too bad, because that bank has many, many lifetime customers."
bad,"Very stressful place to work, goals are too demanding and unrealistic. Management does not calculate the numbers correctly."
bad,"wells pays higher than the rest but they pressure you to sale everything and anything, they dont care if it benefits the customer they just want to meet the unreasonable goals. If you dont meet the goals you get written up and then they constantly annoy you everyday about sales, there might be good weeks but if a week is not good then they start to bug you again. The work environment is horrible. Coworkers fight about sales and cheat one another for sales."
bad,Job felt very insecure. I was constantly scared for my job as employer would hire and lay off every 2-3 months.I felt I needed to find a more secure job.
bad,Wachovia gave me the opportunity to put my roots down and begin my career in banking.  I just happend to work for the bank during the financial crisis.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,If you don't mind selling your grandmother down the creek this is the place. If you never finished college this is the place for you but just as quickly as they hire you they will fire you if you don't go along with their unethical sales practices from the top down. They give you 2 weeks vacation but if your'e sick they force you to use vacation time because you do not get separate sick time nor PTO.
bad,"Very high turnover...Managers getting fired, bankers and teller being fired. Very unstable "
bad,Hostile environment with little tolerance for training or coaching.  It's really sink or swim and intelligence alone probably won't suffice.  I'd recommended coming in with prior banking experience.
bad,"In the morning I would pull the reports that would show the workflow of the day.  I would assign files to the setup team, I had 3 setup teams of 12 people.  I would assist team members who needed help with files.  I handled all the calls from the office of the president of Wells Fargo.  Escalated calls from customers who were irate and were threatening legal actions against Wells Fargo.  I would scrub the files when they were received to see if we were able to work the file.  I would pull various reports and also audit files of the setup team, then report to my manager.  I had various duties and each day was different with much multi tasking."
bad,No matter how hard you work there is no room for advancement.  The merit increase is not fair as if you make more than other employees you will only get ten cents for a raise.  Wells Fargo does not promote employees within.
bad,You perform all the tasks exceptionally and a leading business partner.....It means nothing.
bad,"A typical day at work you come in, log into computer and log in for work, report to management, get assigned to a work station, go to work station, wait to get assigned what job you will be running, once assigned job you wait for job to be brought to your machine which could take 10 minutes to an hour. Once you get job, you request supplies for that job and wait for supplies. While waiting for supplies you log into computer and load job. You physically set cutter blades, from there you make your way down the machine, physically setting up for inserts, envelopes, metering, and then sorting at the end."
bad,"Management is stringent"
bad,"Unorganized training classes"
bad,"It's a great place to work if you appreciate management managing your professional & personal life. The work days are extremely long. Leadership/Management shows favoritism & loves gossip. There are absolutely zero opportunities for advancement. Morale is extremely low, but it's always your own fault. And if you enjoy thinking for yourself, you're bullied and labeled 'negative'. I am assuming that not every entity is as bad as this department, but this is my experience."
bad,Pushing customers into accts that they dont need and or want.
bad,All about the sales and not about the customer or employees needs.
bad,Great Company Great Benefits not so great management and employee relations
bad,"Sales oriented environment, company and top management do not have the customer's best interest at heart."
bad,Wells Fargo  has a great employee  training  culture. to well equip t for specific task.
bad,"A typical day as a Financial Advisor In Training is what you make it.  I put my own structure in mine, with a set number of appointments (10) I tried to make the week before; monthly seminars for prospecting; weekly networking at business and charity groups.  I worked typically 12 hour days, and always put in 4 hours on weekends.  "
bad,"were required to work every other saturday.  other than month end can be long work days depending on volume, co workers were great"
bad,"Not all managers are good leaders. HR seems to be there, mainly to ""run interference"" for complaints against management, rather than to help employees."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"The sales environment is very cutthorat, if you do not meet goal you are fired."
bad,Sales culture that was so aggressive it was not beneficial for customers or employees. High turnover increase stress levels. Poor work life balance. Ability to make good sales commission not easily attainable.
bad,This was the worst job ever...The only thing this company cares about is sales. My manager spent more time away from the branch trying to get sales then trying to be a manager she even asked us to carry new account applications with us at all times so we can try to sell when we werent at work...I do have a life and family outside of wells fargo. Breaks were sometimes not received instead of getting off at 4 would be there to 6 and 7 somedays to of course have a non productive meeting about sales and she even wanted us to work every weekend to get some freaking sales!!!!! My job title was Teller not Car salesman!!!! If I wouldve known it was strictly sales I wouldve not taken the position. I did not sign up to be a door to door sales woman!!!!
bad,Was a phone banker in Allentown call center. was not accessible by public transportation.worked 2nd shift and dealt with angry clients who wanted all fees refunded every call. worked m thru Sat
bad,"A typical day began with team ""huddles"" which was basically the manager asking the team individually to commit to a certain sale volume for the day. This was followed by 8 hrs of irate customers I had to try to push products to. Management would micro manage (hover to ensure I was I selling products while addressing the reason for the customer's visit & ask what I sold with explanation if I did not make a sale.)"
bad,"numerous management issues and new severe security restrictions will stifle innovation and personal growth, there is also no upward mobility within the cash vault"
bad,just don't! not worth your time. the company is not organized and isnt fair to their empolyeers nor their customer. the  pay is low.   people will step on their coworker back to get were they are tying to get... Just sad
bad,productive place to work helpful employees supportive individuals and opportunitues for upward mobility with compensation and room to develop good interpersonal skills
bad,"Working in mortgage sales can take many years to achieve.  I found that sales is a 7 day/week job with not much return.  The industry is a difficult one to get into, on commission only."
bad,"Wells Fargo sales expectations were not unrealistic. I enjoyed the team that I worked with however, Wells Fargo's procedures around opening and closing accounts were not easy to accomplish as I believe that some of the tactics could appear to be unethical."
bad,"Extremely long hours, the more you work the more that is expected of you.  Typical work day starts at 6:30 AM and continues until at least 5 PM, often longer. "
bad,"Too stressful, too many risks, always understaffed, goals conflict with vision. Unprofessional co workers and managers. Eorr ref l somewhere else it’s not worth it"
bad,None. Not a great place. Has bad leadership. Highly biased and a hopeless HR. A all the good people are resigning. Remaining who are there are unable to resign because of personal commitments. Pathetic people values
bad,"The phone banker job was mostly about sales. No matter what the reason for the call is, you had to sell a product or service. If you were told no when asking for permission to sell, then you had to think of ways to get them to say yes. It felt more about making money than providing an exceptional customer experience. I don't know how it is now, I worked there back in 2014 before the lawsuit."
bad,high pressure environment with inexperienced management which had their own set of pressures with no incentive to grow. The Daily sales goals are completely unrealistic and management expects everyone to sell.
bad,"Hired on through an agency as a contract employee with promises of becoming salaried employee. Soon after I was hired they instituted 10 hour mandatory overtime and work us to the bone. While they were working us to death the decided to move the Home Preservation department to another state and told us ""you have a month to find a new job, good luck."""
bad,"I worked for Wells Fargo for a total of 6 years. I loved working for Wells until I moved to the last branch I was at. I advanced in the company quickly at first. I was a teller for a little over a year and then became a Lead Teller and acting Service Manager at the same time. The company worked with my school schedule and provided full benefits to me as a part time employee. I loved interacting with our customers, especially the regulars. And I enjoyed the company of my coworkers. My original goal was to retire from Wells Fargo. When I moved to my last branch the environment was chaotic and unorganized. The branch was extremely busy and the support from management was lacking. I would ask for help and was told to figure it out. Even though the sales goals were removed, other goals replaced them and if the goals were not met, instead of being coached we were talked down to and shunned and made to feel like we were failing. I tried multiple times to advance to a Service Manager or Banker and was denied over 40 times without feedback. There is a lot of nepotism in this company. I began suffering from anxiety and severe anxiety attacks because of the pressure at work and inability to pay my bills despite the amount of work I was doing. My demeanor at work suffered and got worse and worse until I was performing so poorly at work that I was fired. Immediately after being fired my anxiety attacks subsided. I only spent about a month unemployed and was able to find a job that I am very happy with."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"At work things occur and you have to be ready for them, like writing at least one hundred and fifty characters for a review when you can't think of anything to say."
bad,The management at Wells Fargo is not trained very well. There is opportunity to grow with the company but it's very biased. The company is just starting to revamp their values and how they treat employees due to them being sued for it. If a large portion of management was let go the company would have a great recovery.
bad,"lots of problem solving, i loved being able to use my business and real estate skills. I am ambitious and working their certainly allowed me to be able to build many great relationships"
bad,"Not many development opportunities. Takes years to get promoted. Change in policy has caused an increasing layoff rate within district. Retail job, customers aren't always a breeze. UNDERPAID compared to other banking institutions."
bad,"Layoffs are a daily occurrence. There is very little the company can do about market conditions but loyalty is a one way street. Regardless of how long you have spent with the company there is no job security."
bad,I’ve been with the company for many years and here recently the morale has changed drastically. Depending on which site you work at the growth for opportunities are very minimal. It seems as if the company rarely cares about the team members as a whole. Insurance benefits have also changed dramatically and isn’t so great anymore. In most cases very often do they hire from within. It can be very stressful and  at times.
bad,"The position was highly stressful and extremely demanding. There was very little time for breaks, and customer verbal abuse was commonplace. There is no praise and constant negative feedback regarding minimal issues, such as length of time of calls, or time between each call to properly fill out call information."
bad,The hardest part of the job was to keep relationships with banks for referrals because of the high turn over. This home office location ended up closing.
bad,"Banking at a branch is dying. They are cutting employees and moving everything online. They customers who do not want to or cannot do their finances online are not being thought of. It equals short staffing, frustrated customers, incompetent management and an over all stressful environment."
bad,"The Bank management requires its employees to adhere to its vision and values which requires taking multiple compliance tests including reporting employees who have been unethical. However when you do report an incident, such as time sheet fraud, management threatens the whistle blower and protects the person that continues to violate bank policy."
bad,"I learned that the culture and upper management were not what were ultimately presented when I first started working.  Very ""numbers"" driven organization that protects the upper management from being eliminated."
bad,"There is so much inconsistency from branch to branch.   Sales may be gone, but the higher ups still need ways to track you!  In order to advance you either have to be a favorite OR you need to basically do your managers job for at least a year...and then they MIGHT consider moving you up.  Don’t you dare tell anyone above you that they broke policy though, because HR will do nothing and you’ll have a permanent target on your back.   Good riddance!!"
bad,"I came to Wells Fargo with high hopes, however, after 2.5 years here, I am anxious to move on. The company is very large, and with the problems they have had, which you can read in the news, they aren't hiring the best candidates. People are leaving right and left, and the people who have been at WF for many years, are hard to deal with. Constant training, due to the government regulations/fines imposed on WF, and then, here you go, figure it out yourself. "
bad,"12-14 hour work days"
bad,"In this state no matter your work ethic and success in your position, in the mortgage division count on being laid off each year. Then start all over at lower pay each time you are called back.."
bad,No stability but I did learn a lot and I feel like I’m a better person for the experience I’m absolutely better at money now and more aware of my credit
bad,"When I worked there, there was no job advancement...and I was taken for granted.  My boss was horribly micro managing and its like youre working for a dictator.  You can make 800k in sales and still only make 3 grand that month.  Pathetic. You're making all the money for the CEO. Don't do it."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"stressful, and very competitive per area to meet quotas.not as professional as you would think wells fargo is or should be. some leads lack giving support needed."
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked. Lack of management skills and extreme pressure and focus on sales. This place stole my soul. Please for your sanity, do not work here."
bad,"WF has a complete culture of shareholder value and does very little for it's employees.  I haven't had a raise over 1% since I've been at the company even with stellar performance reviews.  When I started, a bonus of around 10% yearly compensation was pretty standard even for those who put in less than 100%.  Nowadays, either you won't get a bonus or it will be very meager.  Management always has an excuse which comes down to cost savings for the company and a better bottom line for the shareholders."
bad,Management was very incompetent and clearly played favorites. Was not flexible with school schedule. Management was also very nosy about personal issues when team members took PTO.
bad,"While I was working for Wells Fargo I learned alot of things. I worked in the default department so we have to do alot of jobs. I ordered grass cut, clean up the property liens, turn the property back to the owner."
bad,"schedule is not bad, benefits were great, however management was very poor.  lack of communication between stores within same district. excellent learning opportunities provided from Wells Fargo."
bad,Management and their leadership are focused on how they can gain for themselves and don't care about their employees. Working on continued strong relationships with my vendors and what I needed from them.
bad,"too much favoritism, we bust our behinds just to watch them give it to a fellow friend. Of course they have to interview all canidates but doesnt mean your potential is appreciated or noticed. Dont get caught under the wronf management team. If you're a person of color you might be asked to change everything about you to ""fit the culture"" whatever that means. Cant wear your hajab unless you look like your're from the middle east because their lack of knowledge. Unacceptible what i experienced. I will say you might find some honest people if you look like them. it's just 10 times harder for those who doesn't."
bad,The tellers dealt with verbal abuse from customers since they would be in hurry and then the management always had to do role playing with the staff instead of helping the customers as they would have lines out the door. Customers should always come first and you had to up sell every customer interaction.
bad,The company should focus on more management and team collaboration along with team morale. Employees would like to feel like they have the support of their upper management which is lacking at this firm.
bad,"Did not like working here, I was asked to compromise my values too many times. They also had managers that I thought was mentally ill. They constantly berated you about sales and intimidated and singled you out in front of your peers. I ended up in the hospital because of the stress of this job. Really bad place to work."
bad,"I was on FMLA while my mother was sick, she passed away and the team manager told me that our ""higher up"" manager advised I only had 2 weeks to get my mothers effects/ court/bills/apartment etc in order or they would terminate me.  Needless to say they had my resignation within 5 minutes after that phone call!"
bad,"Those not part of click treated much differently from those that are:"
bad,the workplace can be quite chaotic mainly due to management or lack there of. They give too much room for managers to discriminate among team members.
bad,The company has not changed much of its culture. Its still a chew you up and spit you out type of company. Many of its policies are not actually changed it has just changed the names of them and how they present them to their employees to sell to customers.
bad,"This review is exclusively for Trade Finance Operation team."
bad,"This was not the best position for me with the exception of the customer service I could offer. Working hours were over 60 a week, too stressful with rising files over the 100's.  Otherwise I loved working with the customers and being able to help them with their mortgage."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Please don't work here if you desire teamwork type atmosphere or room to advance. After this firing they're about to do, I doubt it'll get any better either."
bad,"During my tenure, the environment was very sales driven. There was too much pressure from the top to produce ""solutions"" for customers. From what I hear, the working environment has since changed but I cannot say I have experienced the new culture first hand."
bad,"Somewhere along the line Wells Fargo forgot that it's people in the branches are their strongest asset.  After the 2016 ruling, Wells has shifted focus to ""regaining trust"" of it's customers.  However, the company cannot stay out of the news- with almost every department being effected- and has pushed for ""growth"" at the cost of returning to what feels like the culture of pre-2016 ruling.  Team members are often told that Wells is changing things based on employee feedback and in order for the company to look out for employees' best interests, only to find that it will cost them more money, result in loss of their job, or sacrifice any kind of pay raise."
bad,"Not a place I would recommend working.  Often times, you are forced into an area that you don't wish, performing tasks you are not comfortable with."
bad,"Working for Wells fargo the job wasn't bad it was the people that i worked for. my manger spent so much time trying to find ways to fire me rather than help me, you have to watch your back and what you say cause it can be used against you."
bad,I spent a lot of time making trips on my own dime to gather new customers to come in and bank with Wells Fargo. They never really compensate you for your hard work and all the money that you make them. They care about sales over anything at all cost. No flexibility for parents or amenities for new mothers in which I was while working there and they made it very hard to work with the scheduling.
bad,"I don't like the review process at all.  I believe employees should be able to review managers like mangers get to review employees.  I worked for a company that did this and their managers were exceptional.  I would say I had 2 good managers in my career at Well Fargo.  One when I first entered Wells Fargo, the other I got moved from his group as my position went away as a result of the Norwest and Wells Fargo merge.  Years later I finally got back under his management as was very happy until he retired."
bad,"Great company however based upon the job requirements, the training is should have been more inter-active focused on system procedures & processes, Apply the knowledge with hands on."
bad,"I haven't worked there for 5"
bad,Wells Fargo is not a military friendly employer as it promotes. As a military spouse who would like to maintain their career I found it very difficult to transfer within the company in order to move to be with my special forces spouse. As a result I had to leave the company and no support was provided.
bad,"There is absolutely no advancement opportunity, pay is low, if you are lucky you'll get a raise and your job is at risk for every little thing. Managers are awful. Financial Advisors treat you like garbage. Others are not friendly."
bad,"The pay, benefits, and volunteer work, are about the only thing good working for this company. At first it seemed to be a great place but quickly realized that it wasn't. I would suggest not wasting time and actually looking for a career that you know you will receive great satisfaction from."
bad,"The company continues to implement significant changes, which seemed to escalate with the Federal Reserve mandates, CPFB fines, OCC audits, and more.  Various initiatives for corporate consolidation were implemented after the financial crisis (~2009) and labeled with euphemisms to make investor-friendly reductions to the bottom line sound positive (i.e. ""efficiency"" rather than workforce reduction).  These continued corporate efforts elevate anxiety, anger, and fear among the team members with negative consequences, including a counter-productive work environment, unfriendly internal competition, loss of trust, and toxic ""water-cooler"" talk.  Of course, this is my own personal experience and does not represent the views of others."
bad,I worked there during the time that branch bankers were opening accounts without the customer know.  I lost my bonus multiple time for bad reviews when I would do account reviews and customers would say I never opened that account.  I would get a bad review for something that I did not do.
bad,my opinion is be prepared for change they make changes to their policy so much its not funny qa is a little one sided and ridiculous I really don't have much to say
bad,Started out with a great attitude and management that seemed to care.  Once the purchase of Wachovia happened that went south in a hurry.  Way too much dead weight was kept and the existing Wells Fargo employees felt de-valued.
bad,"The corporate culture is cut-throat, stressful and no work/life balance."
bad,management and hr team is horrible. HR does not care to help you when you have a serious issue they side with the management team. Management can make up and say whatever they want about an employee for their benefit and there is no one that cares what the employee has to say even if the write-ups are unethical.
bad,"The management team is poorly skilled.  They tend to hire minorities with little English skills for data entry levels, knowing that they will never have a chance to grow within Wells Fargo.  The management team is primarily caucasian."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Severe disparity between FTE and contract employees. Management provides no leadership and no structure, let alone guidance. Very much a ""sink or swim"" environment. Compensation is much less than similar positions with comparable companies."
bad,The management was inconsistent with applying and enforcing rules equally. Favoritisms  in  the work place was very evident as well as gossip and negative slurs towards newer employees.
bad,"Beyond difficult to ask a question in this work environment.  It was their way or do not say anything. Promised one thing got something different.  Low moral was just a part of the work environment as some employee basically stated.  Unless, you are in the in crowd."
bad,The environment is made chaotic by the upper level management.  The hardest part of my job was sharing important information and it not being understood or listened to.
bad,I used to be  proud to work for this company. The atmosphere has shifted in the recent year in a negative way. I feel like WF used to be for their employees and customers but those feeling are now changed.
bad,Doesn't treat employees fairly. If you voiced your opinion and she didn't agree with the answer. They find ways to get rid of you and make your life miserable.
bad,I do not recommend because managers hired friends or people that they know.  They overlook the experienced people.  Managers unfair.  Wouldn't approve of an employee moving up and out of the branches of you are a person that they like then yes you can move up in the company.  Their was no one who you could complain to because the managers were friends with the Regional managers..This is just not a great business to work
bad,Mostly spent time on training and attending conferences on line or in person.  Geographic areas assigned for development of business were unfair and unrealistic
bad,"Always promised advsncement, classes, and promotions never materialized. I interviewed for several opportunities during the time I was at WF it was either given to someone expernal or nothing was ever heard again about the posting."
bad,I didn't really enjoy working there. Very stressful and management really didn't have our best interest at heart. Wells Fargo was undergoing major issues and didn't handle it very well.
bad,"I dont agree with all WF policies in regards to rules we must follow and being able to help the customers. I also don't agree with how some branch managers are given favoritism within a region and others are not compensated for their work. Wells Fargo, more than once (and just in my time here) has had opportunities for someone to apply for a different position, but because it would be at a different branch with a leader that doesn't follow policies and procedures, the team member declined to apply. So people who are worth it, and excellent team members, who deserve a chance at a higher paying job,  and the chance to move up - dont because of managers who dont follow the guidelines and rules. All branches do not follow policies and procedures.  Several times a week customers came into the branch I worked at and said that another branch saying ""the other branch allows such and such"", when our branch, following procedures would never allow it. It is not, truly, one Wells Fargo, across the region."
bad,"stress stress stress.. "
bad,"At management tier opportunities only open to those who network heavily, which tends to favor those who don't seek work life balance.  Be prepared to actively network to move up in the organization."
bad,"District managers enable branch managers poor leadership skills and militant style managing in order to maintain a ""personal"" relationship outside of work. All in all, it has been a terrible experience in terms of management."
bad,Wells Fargo is full of crooks that are driven to open accounts that are not needed by the clients they are supposed to serve. they will deceive clients in order to open additional and unneeded accounts.
bad,"While the money is okay, management is awful. They're spread thin and make promises they're supposed to make, like helping you reach your goals within the company. However, when you request to be trained to help reach those goals, you're told that there's nothing in your line of work for it or you're told there's just too much work to be done to allow you that training. "
bad,ridiculous sales goals with daily threats of unemployment.  Sales goals required us to force products on client no matter if product was not suitable for client
bad,"processing and underwriting very slow, non responsive and didn't care about missing closing dates. Management was no help and aloud it to continue with no regard."
bad,"Don't want to work for Wells Fargo. I did not care for the excpieriance. That is all I have to say."
bad,no advancement and no opportunities for growth
bad,"You advance if you're likeable, most other banks pay more, there is division, they require a lot of you with little pay, unethical practices usually lead to promotions"
bad,"Working there you’ll feel like just a number. Excellent source of income, depressing place to go to each day. Management only appreciates you if you’re making them money through sales"
bad,"My entire branch was terminated because use the district manager expected us to meet insanely high sales goals which led to the management team doing some unsavory business tactics that Wells recently in the news for. I did NOT appreciate the way the situation was handled. As tellers, we were just doing as we were told and thought nothing of it. This culture of high stakes sales goals (as in your job relies on it) starts at the top and it needs to be corrected."
bad,"I would not work for Wells Fargo again.  Terrible support, culture, and advancement.  Value of people is a huge opportunity for Wells Fargo.  Operations needs a huge employeee support overall."
bad,"In the south it's all about the good ole boys club. God forbid if you were great at your job no advancement. "
bad,"I worked in sales during the time that Wells Fargo was investigated for. It was extremely stressful, and we had to find ways to sell or add accounts. We commented all the time about the ethical and practical implications, but in the end, we were forced to sell or lose our jobs. I tried to move up, but my numbers didn't  warrant a good recommendation."
bad,Give us you opinion about a typical day at work. What you learned. The management staff. The workplace culture. The hardest part of the job and the most enhoyable part of the job.
bad,You are forced to sell accounts to make more money in commission. Managers schedule their favorite employees with better shifts. Not a lot of room for growth.
bad,"Wells Fargo cash vault is not equal nor is it fair in the distribution of the workload, seems likely that the faster and more advanced you are the harder the work becomes and there is no retribution or consequences for the ones that hardly do any work or that are slow they actually get rewarded by having less work and most of the time work taken from them because of slow production and their work is given to the more faster and advanced workers."
bad,"Management doesn't care about the employee. Pay is ok but when they keep adding on stuff to the job he pay never changes. The raises are a joke and I would almost feel better not getting a raise, its that bad."
bad,Wells Fargo was very sales driven and very unfair for the teller portion. Platform has the potential to get 6+ referrals per customer and tellers were only allowed 3 per customer. Rarely did anyone on the teller side of the branch reach numbers to get incentive. Outrageous methods of reaching out to customers. The pay was horrendous and most people don’t get advanced.
bad,"Pay was not great. I was a contractor, worked there for a few months and excelled but was promised to become permanent and it never happened, quit due to this reason."
bad,"Micromanagement, promises of permanent employment that never came true. Ruse to get contract employees to work more hours in hopes of full time employment. Not healthy environment"
bad,"The work culture is more of a bank, not like any other IT shop.  Long hours of work and time off is open for phone calls.  Once you come in at a pay grade, their is no promotion path."
bad,"A word of warning, working in the Office of the President for Wells Fargo Auto is a joke, not only do they not have a decent management staff, but you are constantly fighting other departments that do not recognize your authority. This is a disappointing move for me as I came from Wells Fargo Bank, I honestly wish that I never left; the environment over here is not conducive to working and enjoying being part of this team. There is no scheduled career path and often you are given no direction regarding performance."
bad,"Easy job; internal politics extreme; conformity encouraged; no recognition or rewards for individual drive or accomplishment; lots of vacation/holiday time off; top-down, oppressive management style; payout poor"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,I work there as a security officer and was not impressed. The work environment is not challenging and it makes it very hard to grow and succeed in the long run. Very poor management and blame officers for everything.
bad,"If you are a processor at Wells Fargo you will be treated like cattle. They will try and get you to sign up for checking/savings, but then try and trick you by transferring money from checking to savings to get overdraft fees."
bad,"As a mid-level manager, I found very little integrity in upper management, which has proven correct when you see all the invetigations into the company and settlements they have paid out to consumers over the last few years."
bad,"Lack of leadership at most levels is apparent every day. Morale is non-existent. Very limited opportunity for advancement, you must apply for any new move, including what would be considered ""promotional"". One of the most stressful jobs I have ever had."
bad,"I was let go after working 24+yrs. I worked thru two mergers. I also worked thru one of the most stressful period in the banking industry. The majority of my experience was in default loans. When most of the inherited portfolio was resolved, I was one of the expendable employees that was terminated."
bad,This place was terrible to work for and had very bad and inconsistent manager who were never on the same page you would be told one thing by one and a whole different thing by another and then be written up and blamed for their errors. Would not recommend this place to my dog.
bad,"Understaffed, work wasn't deligated appropriately "
bad,Bad management with high sales goals. A bonus is given every three months but often wouldn't happen if as a banker you missed even one small section on the sales sheet.
bad,"I was stressed all the time. It wasn't anything to do with customers or my coworkers. It was just the job. They really pushed you to sell, sell, sell."
bad,"Don't care about employees. My co-workers worked years there, gets fired in a matter of 60 days notice. The company shuts down on thousands of people at once, the explanation was ""this is a corporate decision""."
bad,You get the experience but the rest of it is NOT worth it. At least not the branches I've worked at. People who did not deserve promotions to management got them due to who they knew.
bad,"When I was taken out of the market (I managed at one point 32 processors 2-3 hours in each direction) to spend my time being screamed at by my manager, I had to leave.  Unconscionable."
bad,"Branch manager was great;he did the best he could under the pressure he was under, but the morale was low and kept getting lower with bad press.  Turn over was high, customers lacked trust and to deal with that, mgmt expected you to grovel and your performance graded on how far you could bend over backwards. Environment was toxic and lacked stability. I would not recommend."
bad,"I could go work at Bill Millers or DQ and make a dollar less an hour then what I made with Wells Fargo. And way less stress! Lol They couldn't ""afford"" to give us a raise! Wells Fargo is a Joke."
bad,Its all about who you know and now what you do. Company has okay benefits.Fast paced not enough pay for what you do. Culture is all about customers and not team members.
bad,"To much control by some.  Let your employees run with the ball, you might be surprised how well it would go.  Waterfall is dead for a reason, IT DOES NOT WORK!"
bad,"The corporate culture is toxic.  Management is frequently clueless.  The company relies heavily on contractors, more and more of which are offshore.  You can only work for 18 months at a stretch, then you must leave for a minimum of 6 months.  Tribal knowledge is not retained because of this turnover.  Documentation is a joke."
bad,"The pay is very competitive, but no job security. The work is so slow, you know it's only a matter of time before getting the boot. No value to its contractors. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Culture is horrible,  concentrated on  making goals, stressful place to work, no career advancement.  Salary it is too low for the Title. Managers get pushed from District Managers on meeting goals, obligating managers to implement corrective actions to bankers and tellers."
bad,"micro managed at times, others are selected for jobs you are qualified for and it is all based on who management like.  you are over looked for raises they will say you are at the max."
bad,"Wells Fargo paid me and has good PTO and thats all i have good to say about them. It was super slow paced, but on your annual review they would say your are not meeting goals. No one in the department could meet those goals, it was impossible and they are putting you down for it. I didnt like that at all."
bad,"Customer service, Sales, Managing employee down time, reaching goals at all cost. Cold calling, and over the phone sales, balancing Vault, fees review, accounting."
bad,"Worst job I ever had.  Worked in data entry and felt like i was just a body to them. Managers did not seem to care about temp employees at all.  The term ""Managed resources"" was how they referred to us.  The job itself is incredibly dull as well."
bad,"The management were about themselves, well some, if it's not their way, there's no way. When trying to have days off, you cannot have days off if another person in your position has those same days off. It's not fair, you'll have to be there for the company's convenience. Customers always take their frustration out on the wrong people, whenever one bank doesn't do things their way, they take it out on another branch. We used to have quarterly meetings on Saturdays, which it would be all day, we had no time for our families. Next thing you knew, it was Monday already. Management would tell you that you're not ready for the next position. Again, it's on their time when you're ready for a promotion."
bad,"Turnover is extremely high due to poor management.  There is a culture dedicated to the company's bottom line only.  If you can not add to that, you are not welcome."
bad,"Nothing special, just another employer that provides a job."
bad,"It was a great experience working at Wells Fargo with a diverse team. No and environment opportunity to grow as a teamwork. The job was very enjoyable and everyone that I had the opportunity to work with was very friendly and accepting. The pay is not competitive for all positions. It is very stressful environment. The opportunity for advancement is too slow, and the processes are broken up so you cannot stay familiar with all products all the time."
bad,Disgraceful this is a bank and you'd think that a company that is in charge of finances would be run well ha. This company I's a joke they had competitions for pushing things on to customers that they didn't need. Who does that!!!!
bad,"I personally have had an excellent career in a dynamic organization with great opportunities to build leadership capabilities. Some current headwinds, but the overall organization is very solid and committed to correcting areas where mistakes were made. After nearly 30 years with Wells Fargo (and Norwest Corporation) I've seen major changes in both consumer and wholesale banking as the customer base has grown, and have been impressed that the overall positive, hard working culture and commitment to doing what's right for the customer has not wavered, I also believe some major lessons have been learned on how to effectively develop and implement proper controls; this will serve both the clients and employees of WFC well moving forward."
bad,stressful call center pressure. Sales over rated issues with management who does not care if you have a life outside of work. It is  culture issue at WF. I wanted to stay longer but it was definately a bad choice to work with WF
bad,"the mortgage industry was hopefully a bit different then it was now days, i think there hiring practices were not perfect but some businesses have quotas"
bad,"If you're just looking for easy pay and don't care about what is said to you by customers, perfect. If you are an ambitious person, want to move up, and are not one to put your values on the line by becoming a ""teacher's pet""... then don't do it. "
bad,A typical day at work is fine as long as you do not deal with the personal day to day drama. I enjoy learning new things but hate the long hours. Management is great depending on where or which department you are working for. I enjoy all of the clients that I worked for as every situation was different but they all wanted the same result.  And that was to make sure that everyone was happy.
bad,Some financial advisors and management treat their staff poorly and unfairly. They are not treated as part of the team and definitely not appreciated.
bad,"Basically, if you are looking for good benefits then Wells Fargo has a good benefits package. Other than that the environment is very stifling. Advancement is hard to achieve and management is mostly clueless or extremely micromanagement."
bad,Expected to work 60+ hours per week as needed. Required 10+ hours of overtime per week for more than a year straight. PTO was limited/cancelled frequently.  Little support from management. Unreasonable expectations. Team morale was very low.
bad,Most of the time intaking data to make a case for someone to purchase a home or not. I would hold public meetings to share different programs that allow more people to purchase  homes.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Overall there seems to be a lack of emphasis placed on adequate training throughout the organization. Customer facing positions are given training, however, those positions not exposed to external customers are not given that same courtesy."
bad,"The staff at wellsfargo are great."
bad,It was hard keeping up with the pace of key strokes on an daily basics. I liked the work it was a lot of it and It kept you busy. but it was hard on your hands and waist.
bad,NO work life balance at all. Upper management were never satisfied with your performance they always wanted more in order to make more money and make them look better. The worst company I worked for. Never again will I work for a large company.
bad,This is the worst job I have ever had. I would never recommend anyone work there. The ethics were unreal and the managers were cutthroat. You had to hit your sales quota or you would get fired on the spot.
bad,a typical workday is your team has a huddle you work you pipeline and you have an hour lunch 2 fifteen minute breaks.  that is all a typical day consists of for me.
bad,"no room for growth. you have to know somebody that knows somebody to get a promotion. I worked there for years, got a lot of recognition but could not get a promotion."
bad,"During the regular season we stayed pretty busy with work keeping the complex clean. I made it my business to learn how to operate all walk behind and ride on machines. I first started on the floor team but later moved to hydo, for more hours."
bad,In my almost two years working at wells fargo home mortgage I was basically thrown into the fire and expected to survive.  My manager was not very helpful and neither were her managers. Lots of turnover.
bad,"I was promise the position of an Loan Officer. I was asked to work as a teiller to get my foot in the door, because they were short of tellers."
bad,system may mess up never know why you are out of balance nor the manager may never figure it out they are so ready to go home at the end of the day they look for it a second and then make you accept it.  will fire you for being $200  short consecutive times within a quarter which is easy to do shouldn't expect this from a trillion dollar company.
bad,I have seen time and time again co workers not get a job or help in finding a great job because a less qualified individual knows someone or has the in persay. In this atmosphere I see racial bias with management hiring and I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"When I worked there, you had to hit a minimum amount of sales, or you would be written up. It was about 120 products per quarter. Your operations manager breathes down your neck and harasses you as to why you didn't talk to every single customer about a product. Would never work in sales there ever again. It was absolutely miserable."
bad,Fun co-workers but management team not so professional and would make it literally impossible to advance if they don't like you. undoubtedly not the best place to work at.:(
bad,"The company as a whole is good. Good benefits, good PTO, etc. Work in a back office area. Don't work in a branch! You are a number. All they care about is what you have done that day or that hour. There is no loyalty.  I have seen many long-time employees getting fired for tiny so-called infractions (infractions that were either made up or had no ill effects to the bank).  "
bad,After excepting federal money the banking culture changed. They set goals so high it was impossible to reach. They pushed their employees that was very hard in selling customers which could hinder helping the customer and their needs.
bad,"management was young and showed favoritism...stressful environment since training,,,,everyone wanted a way out...this place had bed bugs no one cared...the list goes on and on"
bad,A sales driven culture that is cut-throat and competitive.  Management cares not about the employees only about the bottom line.  i do not recommend them as an employer.
bad,"Unless you are a top level executive, this place will slowly suffocate you.  Between the crazy demands on your time (minimum 7-10 hours of overtime weekly for 2 solid years), the overwhelming emphasis on sales and being repeatedly used as a stepping stone to advance others into the promotions, I had nothing left.  "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"I could no longer work for a company that was telling me to compromise my ethics to reach sales goals. If the goal was 5 and you got 5 products they wanted 10 and if you reached that goal, you were questioned as to why it wasn't more on a DAILY basis."
bad,"Wells Fargo was ok, but very stressful. The overall feeling is that any day could be your last, for any type of reason. Hopefully, in the wake of the recent scandal, there will be several changes."
bad,"The Business Insurance division was just like the current situation at Wells Fargo Bank, threatened to get the numbers or you are likely going to be fired."
bad,"I would have to prospect bank customers on other products which normally they would not need. "
bad,Working at wells fargo depends on your boss...but most managers and DM are not great.  Bad work life balance and a ton of unethical practices going on and where also encouraged.
bad,"organization is always driving the employees towards sales, if goals are not met, then employee is coached and practically put on probation. there is an enormous pressure to refer, sell, cross sell at all costs. employees lunch hours and breaks are hardly respected"
bad,"After a sixteen year career at the same location, the day to day working conditions became unbearable.  I worked alone and often 10 hours a day.  I cared deeply for my coworkers who were also put under a lot of pressure to reach sales goals.  The benefits were above average but not enough to make me go against my personal ethics.  several people lost their jobs for what they were told was other reasons, but we all knew we would be replaced with people they could pay a lot less who did not have the moral ethics we did."
bad,Very stressful place to work. Expectations for sales goals are high pressured and you feel like it's never enough. Opportunity for advancement is not based on your total job experience skills and is almost non-existent. No support system from leadership and manipulation is major with them.
bad,The Bank was a very robotic type of business.  It was not a flexible company and it was not easy to deal with.  It was hard to get transferred to another department.
bad,A lot of organizational changes made without changes to goal made impacted regions performance.............................................................
bad,"I would not recommend working for this company.  Pay is low and they make it too hard to bonus to make up for the pay, therefore, you are stuck with basically base pay only at the end of the month."
bad,High turnover rate. Management doesn't respect employees.Call center environments can be very stressful. The hardest part about the job was dealing with different personalities.
bad,"other than the work-life balance the culture is negative and full of unethical behaviors, the pushing for selling products is impacting the customer opinion."
bad,"Long hours, and difficult customers along with management. Sales goals are unreasonable. Not a positive work area.  I have learned it is best to stay to yourself."
bad,"Wells Fargo did not place much emphasis on its associates. It was evident in the way the building was set up, the cubicles, and even the communications that went out via email. Nothing was celebrated about the associates other than metrics and promotions. Everything was SELL, SELL, SELL! We would only get rewarded for a snack from the snack cart that would come by every month or so ONLY if we met our metrics...says a lot. I felt that growth and development of associates didn't matter to Wells Fargo. It was either do well with your metrics, meaning get off the phone in a timely manner, no matter if you've helped the customer or not, and then MAYBE you can move on up the corporate ladder. Very stressful job, not worth the pay."
bad,Too sell much sells the main object was to trick customer into product was not comfortable with helping peolpe consume more debt.
bad,"Wells has lost touch with servicing clients.  Too concerned with meeting bank requirements."
bad,"The work/life balance is good, but the Management team did not appear to have the necessary skills to effectively management a team and prevent folks from leaving. In addition, there is no advancement opportunity."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,They don't care about or support employees. Not a good place for a career. Sales goals are unbearable. Not much support from upper management
bad,"All day long same thing, sell, sell, sell people things they do not need or want. Repeat customers tell you first thing, they do not need any services before you can even say hello. Everybody thinks they are the manager, very unprofessional place to work. Would not recommend this bank to friends and family."
bad,"Management are bullies, and only promote friends. Management feels  like a secrete society and they all work together. Not all management is this way, its the majority of them however."
bad,High pressure job however employees are well compensated.  The company is rated high based on the organization and tools provided to employees.
bad,Wells Fargo does not uphold the values that they claim. They have neglected their customer and  have done a great diservice
bad,"They push for sales WAY too much to be a teller, you can't even focus on the customer because you're trying to sell sell sell. If you do not meet requirements of selling you're fired."
bad,"Having worked in mortgage lending for 25 years, this bank has been the most difficult to work with to get loans approved.  Management support is almost non-existent.  I do not recommend Wells Fargo."
bad,"Great coworkers but lack of leadership from management, constant change in procedures lack of communication. Job roles change almost weekly very stressful"
bad,I have been working at Wells Fargo for 5 months now and I hate my job.  They are very pushy on selling products and are no longer focused on the customers.  All they are focused on is making sales by opening accts for people.  And if you don't meet what you're supposed to meet then you get fired.  I hate the greedy work enviornment.
bad,"A typical workday consisted of ever-changing priorities, meetings that accomplish very little and daily ridicule of how you are not doing your job correctly. Management is clueless on how to establish culture and build employee morale. I left Wells Fargo as a customer prior to working there and should have followed that decision and never applied. Too big to fail?? I hope not!"
bad,Very sales oriented. No privacy and treats employees like cattle. if you like stress then this is the place for you..........................
bad,A typical day at the location where I worked was havoc. One would always have to contend with insincerity from supervisors and the lack of professionalism.  Lying and backstabbing were a big part of daily activities. Co-workers outside of management were a joy to be around. The hardest part of the job was the constant micromanagement and belittlement of a supervisor who felt that everyone was incapable of performing their daily duties.
bad,"•	Managed a large volume pipeline of loans and/or assigned new loans to other loan team members, and acted as a liaison between lenders and legal department."
bad,"If you want a job just for benefits WF is the place, "
bad,"Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, fronted by SYKES. Only difference is that wells fargo cares about wells fargo's employees. And sykes cares about itself. There is supposed to be a very strict environment about phones and having pens and paper on your desk (if that shoe box is a desk) Then there are the people. All sorts of loud and obnoxious people. But you cant say anything though, because those people are friends with the higher ups, and if they go and talk with their friends, you'll get in trouble. So if you decide to work here, just don't. Its not worth the 9.00 an hour."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of me handling daily customer transactions, & assisting other co-workers in daily bank procedures to make sure everything was completed. Management was overloaded, but I had great co-workers for the most part. The hardest part of my job was the sales goals we had each month & quarter being in the drive thru. The most enjoyable part of my day was helping my customers."
bad,Ok place if you just want a job.  This is not a place voice new ideas and thoughts of change if it is your idea.  If you have an idea insure it is the managers idea otherwise the idea will not go anywhere.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Management is constantly making you feel unworthy. You are constantly asked to lie to make your sales ""look"" better. When I challenged my direct manager for falsifying time sheet records I was retaliated against and when I challenged my district manager for not coming out to talk with a customer that was upset and asked specifically to speak to her I was retaliated against and ultimately lost my job. I would never want to work for this company again."
bad,Wells Fargo has many different departments with varying areas of focus. The job search tool make sorting through the job listings very simple.
bad,High stress environment with large emphasis on production numbers. Management is not supportive and out of touch. Good place to learn to read credit reports.
bad,"•          Responsible for managing the sales and general operations of the branch location. "
bad,Not a lot of benefits and the pay/bonus structure was very poor.  Also no real room to advance your career upward.  Best thing I can say is that you're usually working more than the standard 40 hour work week.
bad,The hours are consistent. The management was lacking. It was a pleasant atmosphere to work in.
bad,"The hours were fine, wages and bonuses were miserly and I generally liked my co-workers.  I learned how the ""bad"" side of lending worked.  I told them time and again the housing bubble would burst but they paid no attention. They read from a script to bamboozle these people into loans they couldn't afford."
bad,"The customer service job is not really customer service.  The Phone Bankers are required to sell products and services, most of which do not benefit the customer."
bad,not easy to cross sell to someone when you know how much money they actually have. Management very hard on you with numbers.
bad,"I reviewed borrower's asset reports to determine amount of credit borrowing capability. Reviewed examiners' reports of the validity of collateral assets by month and made quarterly or annual recommedantions to underwiters and business managers regarding the amount of credit extensions and terms, for my portfolio of borrowers, Additionally, I made annual vistis to slected borrowers (sometimes with the Business Manager to build rapport) or the outside examiner to verify that the examainer was following our guidelines during an examination."
bad,Many bankers don't last at Wells Fargo because the goals are crazy. Management will lie to reach those goals. But when something goes wrong they will throw you under the bus
bad,"Work and life balance is hard to maintain. Working every weekend, not favorable when having a family."
bad,Wells Fargo was not a good fit for me. The customer service was not as much of a focus as I would have liked  it to be.
bad,Drive employees. Come up with ways to sort of deceive customers into signing up for things they don't need. Micromanaging is managements best attributes.
bad,"company sets very high sales goals that are impossible to meet then forces employees to push products on customers."
bad,"Boy, do we miss Wachovia!Those were the good old days! With twice daily conference calls to report branch numbers, employee engagement and morale at what has to be the lowest in the industry, and poor leadership, turnover is unsustainable, and whatever talent you do acquire, bolts at the first chance they get. Great sales and service processes, but impossible to execute due to the amount of time spent on conference calls reporting progress to management. Stressful, fast-paced working working conditions at all times. This place is NOT for everyone..."
bad,Very unethical sales culture. Days full of being micromanaged by individuals who cannot complete the tasks set in front of you themselves.
bad,"I enjoyed working for Wells Fargo. The day was spent on the phone helping people with the biggest decision of their lives, their homes. The best part was when I could assist them to pay off their home or assist with mortgage problems. The hardest was taking the verbal abuse from someone that had just lost their home. My new manager was, in front of me, able to be able to assist when I had family emergency and promised that I would be able to return once the problems were taken care of. When I made my attempt to return, that was not the case."
bad,The idea of customer comes first is spoken to you each and every day.  But what really counts during sales meetings and one on one reviews is your numbers which really does not play along with what is most important to the customers.  Fees are too high and too many. Greed is wells fargo.
bad,It is a company all about sales for the most part depending on what area you work in. The opportunities are there if you can hang on and so is the stress.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,I loved the aspect of customer service and the values it held with Wachovia.  The dynamic changed when it became Wells Fargo and became sales based.  That was the hardest part of the transition.
bad,Wells Fargo is a company that makes it clear they do not value their employees. There is very little opportunities for advancement.
bad,Just wouldn't recommend the position for the sales goals. Never have I been with any business so set on treating their customers like numbers.
bad,"Its okay, but with out college education you won't move up in company. Doesn't matter if your new or not they'll move your department when ever and make you work weekends. Upper management does nothing. They only take care of there best friends. This was not in a branch I worked in there corporate center."
bad,Wells Fargo has presented many changes and different projects since starting with this company. I have been able to work closely with the OCC and many other departments within Wells Fargo.
bad,There were a lot of issues with this company as far as instability and poor decision making from upper management. Difficult job to take time off from as your work would be waiting for you when you get back. A lot of pressure put on for things that are out of your control as well.
bad,"Not a very good place to work, moved you around a lot, no sick leave. min. vacation time, very low paying"
bad,"Even though I was very successful, upper management were more afraid of their job security and pushing unneeded products on customers. This was the biggest reason I chose to take my future in my own hands and branch out for a more opportunistic position."
bad, 
bad,"Very hectic place and a great deal of pressures.  Instead of re-training their devoted, talented staff, they closed the department leaving no opportunity to continue employment."
bad,"Wells Fargo hired me as a part time teller my junior year in college. I completed a training course that lasted for 2 weeks and I was after this point very encouraged. I was very unhappy when I was just thrown onto a drawer after only shadowing another teller for a day. I was taught next to nothing about sales and was expected to exceed expectation. I eventually got the hang of the process. My manager did not handle stress well, so of course the blunt of her frustration was passed down to our sales team."
bad,high stress
bad,Worked for the place many years . The biggest problem is some managers sides with brown nosers. Which if you employ cheesy management then you get stuff like that. Also to much buddy buddy with some employees . Its a large company simply by numbers only. If you work for the bank side watch your back from other them members and some management. People that dont know there jobs get easy promotions and the hard workers end up leaving after much frustration. Upper corporate needs to clean house on the lower end managers that really dont know there jobs . Beware !
bad,You will never sell enough to get management off of your back.
bad,"I have worked now for Wells Fargo for six months after having worked at another financial institution for ten years. While my job there involved dealing with numerous Type A indivdiuals, nothing there was as bad as it is at Wells Fargo. The ""partners"" I work with at Wells Fargo are the rudest, most impatient, pushy people I have ever dealt with in my entire career in the financial industry. I work in the fiduciary group, and interact with numerous Trust Officers from the field, as well as Trust Managers, and with only a few exceptions, they all treat their ""partners"", who are there to help them, like dogs who are there to be kicked around and abused. I literally had one ""partner"" in California screaming at me on the phone, and I had never even spoken to him before. My manager is great, however there is nothing that she can do about the abuse, because when she calls them on it, they then start abusing her. The only thing that matters is sales, sales, sales. It is all about new business, and nothing else. Account loadings are ridiculously high, which causes everyone to be overworked, and then they get behind, and then the ""partners"" start to call and complain about how unresponsive everyone is and then they ""elevate"" everything to management, who again are powerless to do anything, because senior management does nothing. One of my coworkers was literally pushed to tears by the abuse. On top of this horrific environment, the salaries are low and the bonuses are skimpy if there is one at all. Wells Fargo = Indentured Servitude. STAY AWAY! I wish I could find another job today!"
bad,Aggressive sales goals and dealing with angry customer day by day can become mentally stressful.
bad,I learned a lot about banking and customer service. My co workers were great and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was trying to sell to customers.
bad,Difficult and stressful environment. Unrealistic demands of employees and unfair and inconsistent evaluation practices
bad,micro managed daily only thing important is goals! WELLS FARGO DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES OR THEIR CUSTOMERS!
bad,"At any point in time your schedule will change, and you'll have to stay late or come in early. This all without asking just making auto adjustments, printing the new schedule out, and posting it so everyone can view the new changes as they go to leave for the day..."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"I have been in banking for over 10 years and was highly disappointed in this company. As a matter of fact, I am no longer looking to work in banking after my experience there. There is a culture of money, money, money and very little concern for the customers. You are encouraged to make the call as short as possible whether the issue is resolved or not, But before you hang up, you had better transfer them to sales and talk them into buying something. And selling is not an option, it is a must~! If you aren't meeting the levels ""they feel you are capable of"" (even if you are meeting the minimums) you will be coached as often as everyday. Very stressful and hard on confidence. Would never recommend working there!!!"
bad,I enjoy the people I work with and the customers that we serve.
bad,The sales culture has got to go and the scripting as well. If you enjoy being a human robot with being required to say the same 5 scripted lines over and over again then this is for you. Outside of that; its decent at best. Low pay. This is not a job that you can live off on your own financially.
bad,"Reviewing of real estate loan documents for new and refinanced mortgages (Conventional and FHA) to determine and ensure the adequacy and accuracy to be in compliance with bank policy and procedures, Utilized Calyx and MS Office. I provided timely review of home loans for loan modifications. Lastly worked in the loss mitigation area and was a direct communicator dealing with 50+ customers daily who were going into foreclosure. Researched whether customer qualified for modifications and explained the entire process to the customer in terms they could understand, also explained when a modification was not available and communicated with decorum when a short sale or foreclosure was necessary."
bad,"Wells Fargo is a very diverse company. The company has a very strong foot hold within the mortgage industry. Wells Fargo is known for her tactics in persuading consumers into loans which can in the long run hurt the consumer. Although they are a very demanding company, they be untrustworthy."
bad,"Low pay, high sales goals that are almost unachieveable in certain markets."
bad,Review stats and coached employees everyday. Wells Fargo goal is to get rid of the high salary employees and hire in for low salaries.
bad,"Unless you have worked in a cell phone store jamming phone cases and chargers and extra warranty down people's throats and you have immensely loved it, don't even consider working for Wells Fargo."
bad,"the people there just talked a lot about you behind your back. all they care about is sales, if you didnt get a sale you get talked to. had a horrible experience with them"
bad,Is a productive environment but they do expect a lot more than 100% in productivity rate. Are not that willing to work with you when you want vacation time.
bad,"I had left my previous place of employment to join a new company for more experience, however in that I am not currently happy in the department that I am currently in because of the process as well as the way that the management is performing. If I had know what I know now I would have stayed at my previous employment as they really care and listen to their employees and try to provide a good workplace environment."
bad,I loved it at first but there is a lot of favoritism. There are people there who get away with things that they shouldn't never again will I be walked over and taken advantage of because I am a nice person thanks to my tie spent at Wells Fargo.
bad,"As a result of a merger, climate and working conditions changed. Most employees very unhappy with the changes. New responsiblities and inadequate training."
bad,This company was one of the best employers before being bought out by Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo is very sales oriented. The turnover rate is very high and the environment is stressful.
bad,"No oportunity to grow they promise if you do this and that they will help ypu but is not, they want you to work all the time, if you request vacation is always a problem"
bad,There is very little in-work socialization due to high production goals. My manager is remote and it made communication very difficult. There is very little interaction between managers and team leads aside from questioning about specific work.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Management is more worried about audits and keeping the higher ups happy which leads to not treating employees like people and extremely high turnover
bad,They were in trouble for pushing sales years ago and was supposed to stop but they haven’t. Everything is just worded differently so the regulators don’t see it.
bad,"Having a work experience that gives you the opportunity to help uncover the needs of others as well as educate them on their finances for me, is invaluable. I enjoy working for a company that compensates it's employees and ensures they have access to the best benefits they can possibly have. Learning something new every single day at work, I also truly enjoy helping people and I love that this company allows me to do that. "
bad,"If you get in with the right work team or business unit it can be a great place to work and develop your career, but be warily that this is not a consistent culture throughout the organization. There are departments and business units where management have hold views that are not conducive to healthy work/life balance, do not allow for flexible work hours or schedules, and seem to be behind the times in their promotion of diversity candidates and gender equality practices in their promotion and advancement opportunities."
bad,"Management is selected from a group of 'yes' employees. Just a modern day 'boys club'. On multiple occasions, we watched perfectly capable employees get passed over for a promotion in favor of less capable, but more subordinate employees."
bad,"The site I worked at had poor leadership, however this could have changed since then. Just goes to show how your leader can impact the work environment."
bad,"Can be a good place to work depending on the location, department and who you report to.  Benefits are good.  However, the level of professionalism is not always what it should be.  Production goals are very high, and, often set by individuals that have no knowledge of what tasks/work involve.  Employee stress levels are often very high."
bad,I survived 20 years. I started working pt teller while in school. I loved helping customers but in about 2003 the culture changed and they no longer cared about customers nor employees.
bad,"I was under contract and my recruiting company lied to me about the duration of the contract, benefits, etc. I was really excited to work here but was extremely disappointed when I realized I had been lied to."
bad,I loved working for Wells Fargo until I needed management to help with issues the branch as a whole was having with a coworker but because he is  a homosexual; Wells Fargo did not want to confront the situation and kept sweeping it under the rug.
bad,"Although I worked for the company, when I moved out of GA, I had to re apply for new locations yes many branches because they wont rehire pregnant woman.  Discrimination big time I felt. I had a great reputation from the location I came from so its not because I was not productive and skillful but still couldn't get rehired eventhough I was there employee but pregnant."
bad,"Good Work Life Balance, Benefits, Compensation. Not a good place for career advancement. "
bad,Wells Fargo’s problems are notorious now but those who worked there knew long before the public. The pressure to perform was very high and sometimes the standard would increase 2-3 times because everyone was hitting the mark
bad,"People in management positions tend to treat their assistants as if they are beneath them.  They talk bad about lower staff when they are not around.  The only people getting advancement or raises are the people within their circle only - never the clerical staff.  "
bad,Finally left Wells Fargo Securities after being treated poorly for many years.  Company and division are shrinking.  Would not recommend working with this company.
bad,"There are some very talented people working at WF, but there are also some equally untalented managers. If you can get on a good team you'll have a great time, but my experience was not like that. Some in middle management have very odd ways of communicating their requirements that often make it difficult to understand just what it is they want, and they are very unforgiving when you're first trying to figure out their processes. They're taking a beating in the press and before Congress, so expect a lot of furlough days as they scramble to boost their stock price. On the whole, unless you get lucky I wouldn't contract with them again."
bad,"I was excited for the opportunity when I got on with Wells. However, during the 4 years I worked there multiple scandals came out, and continued to come out. The company didn't reward employees for staying, raised pay for starting employees, and kept the previously hired employees at the same rate. As scandals came out, Wells Fargo would claim they were changing, but would essentially change the window dressing for the same practices they had been doing previously. I am grateful for the things I learned, but I do not recommend them as a place of employment."
bad,"Typical day was spent with clients, staff and management to review reports."
bad,I received a call from a recruiter who was interested in me supporting their Mobile Banking product. This was based off of my support experience in the wireless industry. After being hired I realized that this position also required upselling and there was tremendous pressure to do so.
bad,"Wells Fargo use to be a wonderful place to work!  The legacy Wells Fargo culture use to be very employee focused and there were countless opportunities for advancement.  Its a shame that greed of a relatively small number of people, destroyed such a strong and reputable company.  "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Sales pressure. Sales scamming. Horrible job for someone who wants to help customers with their banking. I left a few months before it came out nationally that they were frauding customers with unknown accounts and credit cards, but it was known about when I was there. Not sure how it is now."
bad,Not the job for you if you want more time for yourself or family. This company is all about profit and didn’t care about its employees. Really bad experience.
bad,"This is not a place that really values hard work or ethics. Employees are told from day one that their opinions and work life balance are not valued. Their motto is if you don't like their standards or way of business... ""You can and will be promoted to customer."" Their way of saying Here's the door."
bad,"I worked as a temp to full time hire EE, but my degree in Engineering and my proposal for saving them time and money, got me fired. One day, they told me not to work very hard so they could keep their jobs."
bad,"Account Resolution specialist III. Used to be a great job before the ""restructure"" now very poor culture. Jobs are threatened daily, rules are updated weekly and manager never quite seem to know what is going on. People are promoted based on politics and often do not know what they are doing. Most stressful working environment I have ever had, and I am a veteran. Would not recommend Wells Fargo call center to anyone."
bad,The last branch I worked at was the worst experience. There was a lot of fakeness and a constant feel of job insecurity and plotting. Very toxic and unnecessary high stress.
bad,"Very upset with the way things were handled in regards to my termination. My girlfriend was about 6 months pregnant, and had a miscarriage. I took some bereavement or time off to be there for her emotionally and to gather my own wellness. Upon my return to work I was fired because I didn't file or handle the bereavement properly, even though I was never shown how to. They basically congratulated my loss with firing me"
bad,"Always stay clear of jobs with high turn around. Wells Fargo in Greensboro has a very high turn arounds for a reason. Management Sucks! They act like the care and want to see everyone in the branch succeed, but they only want to see there favorites succeed and that involves sucking up to the the branch manager. It’s a lot of favoritism and people who belittle new hires. The energy is bad and it’s not the best place to work."
bad,"Be careful at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. Lots of  people are climbing the corporate ladder and nothing including morals or integrity will stop them. You are a number, no one helps eachother. Sink or swim."
bad,They micromanage everything youbare never good enough always want more .. Benefits are good thats about it managers do no manage alot of gossiping can always be replaced no matter how many years you been with the company stressfull
bad,I left before all of the public knew about the unsavory practices at Wells Fargo.  I am not surprised that Wells Fargo can not find a new CEO.  The company has a long way to go to earn back the public's trust.
bad,They are more about the customer than the employees.Every branch is different so find one that works for you. I was at a bad branch so choose wisely .
bad,Pay is good company sucks overall . The company doesn’t care about employees and what they have going on but will work you like a slave managers nosey and always in your personal life
bad,The only good part about working there is sometimes I could be home to see my family and eat dinner with them. Most of the days I'd be there until 6 when we were scheduled until 5:15 or 5:30. Then back there again at either 8am or 8:15am. You were lucky to get an hour lunch since most of the time you'd get 45.
bad,if you have a large blatter and love to be timed for everything then this is the company for you. I worked for the fraud detection call center and they are so badly managed that i was let fo because i had to end a call without tgransferring to a supervisor after the customer asked for one but only because i couldn't find a sup. I called all 4 supervisors on duty that day and not a single one would take my call. I eventually had to ask the caller to call back.  which is a big no no and was fired.
bad,"WF started as a great place to work but it has become very obvious that they only care about that bottom line.   My department is critical to the mortgage process but doesn't actively generate money so we're bottom of the pile. Work life balance is a joke esp. during the summer, they continue to tell us we're appropriately staffed as we flounder dealing with the summer influx. Shady behavior by sales team members is overlooked because they bring in the money."
bad,"Very structured position and department. Little to no career growth unless you wanted to move to a new department/job function."
bad,"Ok company if you don’t mind working 10-12-hour days constantly. Direct management is great, but senior leadership can’t staff teams appropriately for the amount of work needed to be done, causing unnecessary stress levels and employee turnover. Heavy internal processes are always changing with little training on specifics. Good benefits and pay but no room for advancement up the ladder. Company doesn’t seem to promote from within."
bad,"Workload is highly and pay decreased the last 6months with major turnover from senior leader.  Pay is per tier 1-2=50, 3-5= 120, and 8+ 180 per loan. The bigger commission is on the kickers that are 70% depending if they want to pay it monthly."
bad,Great job that anyone would enjoy. The management just needs to be adjusted and feel like you are a great employee. I love the pay and the benefits that come with the job.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Worked with the company for 10 years. CEO retired with 3 million retirement then the next CEO did the same. "
bad,"I worked at 2 campuses for Wells Fargo, I was starting at the. Framingham campus of mass bay comm. College"
bad,Don't work here. One day you may have a job the next day you don't. mangers don't communicate with you Wells. Its all about favoritism and who you know. I scratch your back if you scratch mine type of attitude.
bad,"I enjoyed working for the company, however it was a challenging place to be.  The people that i worked with were GREAT, extremely hard working and professional."
bad,"When I started with Wells Fargo in Chicago, I loved it. The company had some issues but overall it was great. Once I moved to the Beverly Hills location things changed. Our managers expected us to do much more than we were paid to do and there was a great deal of harassment and disrespect. I would absolutely not recommend anyone, especially a person of color to work for this company."
bad,"The company has moved from sales goals to creating lifelong friendships with customers in order to try to salvage their reputation. You no longer have to meet sales goals, but are now required to meet goals based on how many meaningful conversations you had or if you had a financial conversation that could lead to sitting with a banker in order to push a new service onto them. The higher that goal goes the more incentive the branch receives. They can word it differently, but it's still the same thing, now it's just more appealing to the customer. A typical day starts with morning huddles to practice having meaningful conversations and then having a few minutes left to try to get your opening tasks done and getting yourself organized for the day which just leads to falling behind first thing in the morning. Usually always short staffed. Your schedule will be changed last minute without your knowledge. Breaks and lunches are never given on time. or at all, as management doesn't pay attention. They claim to have an inclusive culture where you can be unique and genuine, but provide scripts of what to say to customers word for word to empathize with them or to try to push a new service onto them. Wells Fargo doesn't seem to know the difference between empathize and sympathize as they say NOT to sympathize yet they describe sympathizing when the topic of empathizing comes up. Lead tellers are often left with service manager's responsibilities while receiving a fraction of the pay. Management lets emotions get in the way of their role leading to retaliation when you bring up an issue"
bad,The company gives you a lot of freedom to do as you want.  Your day is your time.  Because of the public image problem they are a bit strong on compliance.  Meetings are once a month.  They pay very well for a Book of Business.
bad,Morale is terrible. We exist to fulfill regulators demands. There is no innovation or new product development. The only projects are risk and regulatory driven.
bad,"Mediocrity infests middle management. Layoffs and job eliminations are common across most departments, and even 40-year employees can be suddenly terminated within a year of retirement. Annual salary ""growth"" of 1%-2% is typical. Culture evolves slowly and avoids changes regardless of profit opportunities. Senior management is indifferent to issues that are damaging regular employees."
bad,"When I worked here, management only cared about making sales. They'd pressure you to open up accounts or to change someone's accounts to get credit for a ""sale"". "
bad,"Well what can you say about a massive corporation. They pay the big  guys lots of money to put pressure on the average Joe. If they would let me just do my job everyday the way I wanted to do it, I would probably still be working there. I sat at my desk and took phone calls from bankers basically asking me how to do their job. I would have to walk them through step by step every detail of the computer system and what questions they should be asking their client to best serve them... but all the banker really cared about was making sales goals so they could make more money. They always wanted work around or ways to cheat the system. I learned a lot about CD's and IRA's and the over all structure of how WF internal system operates. The workplace culture was pretty much this. Everyone on the phones where super decent people and super duper good at their jobs. The management team tried their best to help us with everything within their power... but upper management is where the really stinkers lived... they where disconnected with what was really going on out on the floor. The person above them told them to jump and upper management said how high? That trickled down to everyone else. New and dumb changes every day that slowed our work because our jobs where at risk if we didn't adhere. Constantly focused on the changes and our own hides verses our actual customers. The hardest part of the job was every second of your time at work was monitored and tracked. The best part was the people that I worked with."
bad,"They laid me off bc of their fraud opening accounts, so i don't have much to say.  If they invested in their employees as much as their collusion, maybe people would be happier there."
bad,"Sales goals were unrealistic, forced to work late to make sales calls. management would push employees to sell products to customers that would not help them."
bad,"It was by far, the most relaxed place I have ever worked.  Even though you have to go through so many hoops to get hired.  And once you do get hired there is so much, to be mindful of.  Not to mention the fact that evryday, you have to go through a fingerprint scanner, then a pass word protected door and after all of that you still have to have an armed officer, ""buzz"" you into your wrk area.  And have t repeat that four times everyday."
bad,"WF is very political with it's hiring process. It's about who know which can make it difficult to advance. Management and work life balance is not very flexible. Upsides: PTO, 401k, benefits, free checking account."
bad,The job was very stressful and the leadership or lack there of made the environment very unhealthy. The Managers need to be properly trained and educated on the company's values.
bad,Review all financial and credit documentation required for loan approval or to modify current loan terms for new and current customers. Implemented all fraud detection techniques and performing complex reviews to ensure all guidelines were met.
bad,not a good place to work - management does whatever they want with no regard for how it affects the workplace or the people who have to endure the changes
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Long hours, stressful environment, unrealistic sales goals"
bad,Management is not that helpful. After the merger with Whacovia the company culture changed for the worst. We've all seen how bad it has been for the past 8 years or so .
bad,high stress unrealistic goals shark like mentality no culture and did not like how you have to suck up to management to get to a higher position. No integrity
bad,its not the best but yknow its a bank. Can not really complain too much. Banks are strict in their own manner of speaking. but family is not important
bad,"Completed complex loan review daily.  Constant communication with Account Executive and Brokers.  Reviewed credit, income, title and appraisal to see if borrowers would qualify for a loan."
bad,"Wells Fargo is moving to a more automated origination and centralized sales platform. With recent scandals referrals from bank partners have dropped by 80%. With rising interest rates and more bank leads being sent to their centralized sales platform, Wells Fargo still increased their minimum sales goals to illuminate many origination positions."
bad,"Exactly what the title says. They where pushy and did lots of illegal things to make sales. I don't know what it is like now that this has all come to light, but I will never think of working or doing business with this company again."
bad,"I would guess that things are better after the bad publicity. I am not sure how much things really changed. If you are in a good branch with lots of traffic and you can cross sell, you will meet goals."
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job was assisting homeowners with obtaining a new home. My co-workers and I worked diligently to make sure our customers were satisfied with the process.
bad,"Dislike management skills; violated Management skills 101 where it was brought to attention to human resources. Management showed favors to other employees. "
bad,Wells Fargo has some insensitive DM that will throw you under the bus to protect and even lie about events that take place. Don't trust working for a company that hires individuals like this.
bad,"Wells Fargo has had many issues with illegal and poor business models and choices. I was employed by them during this time, and it was unfortunate to be taught how to deceive people without being caught. This is the reason I left the company. The ethics were terrible."
bad,"I do not recommend WF for anyone. I did not enjoy my time there. Branch manager nice, but my leads we AWFUL. They said they cut out ""goals"" because of the big scandal, but they still pushed you to get credit cards and other accounts on the low, without others knowing. They would write you up if you didn't meet the ""goal"" they wanted you to have. I can not speak for ALL of them, but I can definitely speak for mine."
bad,"A typical day at work involved helping a lot of customers. "
bad,The term predatory lending didn't exist when we were selling mortgages at 10 and 12%. What I saw there did not give me much confidence in the banking industry. Agents would say whatever they had to to get a sale
bad,Expect too much too soon. Training is crammed into a short amount of time making it difficult to get a handle on things. Too many meetings and conference calls. Can't get work done for all the confrence calls.
bad,Vulture culture. Would not recommend as job. Customer care is the last priority. Built on product pushing and signing up customers for products they don't need.
bad,"Wells is going through many struggles addressing market pressures and remaining relevant in the face of newer more agile competition, as such the management is ""doing their best"" given the large number of folks under powered poorly performing 3 to 4 down management who are more concerned at keep their job than doing hard work.  This mediocracy appears in the indecision snd ramped bad behavior or the abiltity to take on such a monumental task of driving standards and practices.  The cost saving pressures, lack of leadership and vision combined with those that are just hanging on to their jobs makes the environment more hostile than not. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,In my position i felt as though there was so much pressure applied to us to my sales goals. They wanted us to focus on assisting customer but it was stressed so much more to meet sales goals
bad,"Typical work day I'd be bored out of my mind, begging my boss to give me work. I was always called in to talk to my boss when I was in trouble, but never to acknowledge anything good. She didn't acknowledge bereavement, birthdays, or good work. She would barely say good morning."
bad,Needs serious improvement. Benefits are the only great thing. Management doesn't fulfil the obligation an employer had to listen to it's employees. I've lost a lot of pride I had in wf
bad,Not a great work environment at any branch. You have to be able to conform to the revolving door of different managers at every location. I stayed because I had to. I didn’t want to scar my employment history.
bad,It was a long hard journey through the Wells Fargo culture. I hope they change for the better. Sent years working around their sales goals and expectations. They were a high pressure sales environment that lead by reports with little to no inspection. I left just after the new regime to over. They changed a lot of the words we used multiple time during my stent. Always seem to be the same meaning.
bad,"Wells Fargo has a big name, meaning many people will recognize the company and be willing to work with you. They did not offer a lot of training to get you started, so you should have established mortgage originating knowledge."
bad,"I come to work at 9pm and I log in and begin keying no talking is allowed, I feel like a robot with no emotions, management at this point in time is not suitable for the needs of the employees. Production very fast paced. Enjoyable part of job is having a job."
bad,knew almost from the get go it wasnt going to last here mainly due to the practices that were being done and unrealistic goals set.  it was not an environment that truly had the clients best financial needs in mind it was all about the numbers.
bad,"A work day consist of a standing not allowed to set or lean on the counter and facing forward with a higher position staff member standing by my shoulder watching every customer I help then ""coaching"" meaning lecturing me what produces the guest account did not have and why did I not ""make"" them set with a banker to establish those products and most of them are normal customer who been spoken to and asked not to be bothered. Also consist of management grilling staff about sales sending staff to local flea markets, bus stops, colleges, and walking around malls for sales. It became stressful even when you make a sale because someone else who working ""buddies"" with the banker you sent your customer to has tagged the account. Hard work does not pay off at Wells Fargo because Head Quarter staff set goals and branch staff scheme and cheat to meat those goals so for those who work hard get over looked."
bad,"I had been with a company for sometime performing multiple duties. When I was up for promotion my application was overlooked because the DM wanted to put something they knew personally at that location.After 4 denials I was finally considered only because that store was desperate. By the time I had gotten there, I realized I was being overworked and taken advantage of. I tried to hold out but I was over the company as a whole."
bad,"Very fast paced, assistants are not treated very well and do most of the work.  They work more than the actual loan officers do.  Computer systems were down a lot making it very difficult to meet deadlines or go home at a reasonable time"
bad,"Management at Olympia Parkway was horrible, Branch Manager is very much a do as I say and not as I do type of leader, people under did not respond well to that."
bad,"The software test department is swamped with QA leads who don't want to work but rather crack the whips. Some of the leads should never work with people since they don't know how to behave properly. Unfortunately, this is overlooked by two QA managers who feel like Maharajas."
bad,"So many politics, high pressure sales, never get to use your paid time off. DM and area president only care about the numbers, not their employees. No advancement unless you kiss butt or know someone."
bad,Played favorites and promoted younger people. Would not go back.Most miserable time of my life. Made kids with no supervisor experience managers and didn't know what they were doing.
bad,"There are a  lot of layoffs"
bad,Wells Fargo is a big bank and it has a big bank culture. Many of the processes and management levels are redundant.  There are a lot of good ideas in the resources but management has no idea what the steps are to deliver those good ideas to employees.
bad,"I've spent the past year at the top of the department in performance. I'm not getting the promotions. The managers' friends are getting the promotions. I'm surrounded by incompetent idiots who make more money than I do. If you're an incompetent idiot, Wells Fargo might be the place for you!"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,100% different than General Electric.  On surface very employee friendly.  Very bureaucratic.  Pressure to do it better do it right.  To much emphasis on keeping customer happy vs. following procedures.
bad,"This company is too large. It has multiple departments spread across different geographical locations, and the management is subject to political pressure from each of these locations. There is a push to save money by any means, which harms the average worker in the company - putting undue pressure on some teams while having some other teams work a lot less."
bad,"worse place to  work. managements are bullies, and unethical. They care only for bonuses and will do anything unethical to get it.  a lot of corruption and  manupilation in the department."
bad,"It was a good company to work for, before the issues that arose in 2016 and after. After those issues we were forced to accept responsibility for actions that the CEO's and other top management within the company was liable for. Our monthly bonus's were taken away from us. It was a good company to work for, but now... its embarrassing to say that I worked for Wells Fargo."
bad,"sadly to see how this great company ruined and damage so many employees resume and career goals because of sales goals. Culture and mission was not follow, and working there was never enjoyable."
bad,I dont want to do this review but you wont get off my screen. So i will just type enoughwords so i can get passed this screen because this is rediculous
bad,"Instead of the company laying off employees, they will make up reasons to terminate them."
bad,"There is no advancement opportuntiies, managers are in it for themselves and not their teams, pay is low for what I could get elsewhere.  PTO is a lot which is great but there's more to a job than just that.  Lots of great people have left because of these issues."
bad,I am not writing a review at this time due to the fact that I am no longer employed there and was not there during the transition of culture and leadership
bad,"My Branch Manager has issues with his temper, which frequently got him in trouble and no one seemed to care. Made for a very poor workplace culture and his manager didn't seemed to care."
bad,Poor culture. Very high turnover. Goals and incentives adjusted multiple times lowering bonuses for sales staff and turning an ok paying job into a low paying job.
bad,"This company doesn't care anything about its employees. As a single parent of one, my schedule was never made to accommodate scheduling with my son and school. When entering the company as a teller you aren't showed any respect. The job requires way more work than what they pay you and advancement in the company is hard to come by."
bad,"Wells Fargo's culture as a company is not good business practice which led to alot of turnovers. It seems like all promotions and incentives were given to the ""popular"" individuals of thew company. Alot of favortism and unfairness."
bad,The work environment was cut-throat and not a team type atmosphere.  We were expected to sell products to customers knowing that these products were not in the customer's best interest but only so we could get the sales numbers for the day/quarter.  Bonuses were unobtainable unless unethical practices were used.
bad,it was very difficult to please all your clients needs in a single call. there sales goals were to high and the customers were very rude and wells fargo felt that you got paid enogh to take the abuse from the clients and the management team. managers felt that your job was supposed to be more important than your children
bad,"Wells Fargo only will allow contractors to work for 18 months.  I was on a very challenging and equally stressful technical production support team with a demanding 24-7 on call rotations.  Chances are, when your on on call, you will have 2-3 nights with difficult on calls. "
bad,"Poor management, factory type of environment. SALES, SALES, SALES is the only thing important even if customer don't agree. I will not recommend it to anyone."
bad,"Worked many hours and on weekends.  Made new connections weekly, visited realtors,and title companies.  Gave workshops, broker openings and realtor openings.  Went to open houses on week days and weekends.  Required to sit in banks twice a week.  Took up to 60-75 days to close a file.  Very challenging place to work."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"I left before everything blew up, so maybe things are different now, but unethical behavior was the norm when I was there. The sales pressure was out of control."
bad,I do not feel comfortable with this being mandatory. Where does this go anyway? If it is not included why ask? It's going someplace and I would be more willing to complete these section if it was disclosed in detail.
bad,"always trying to beat the other person in sales, even if you saw the same customers every day. not a fun place to work. Always stressed out while working there."
bad,"Everything was fine in my department until the managers began to require you to ask for permission to go to the restroom. As adults, we should be able to govern our restroom time. Unfortunately, it came to this and the pay wasn't good enough for the stress."
bad,"While the overall state of Wells Fargo is moving in the right direction, many branches are being left behind and continue to operate in poor standards worsened by the ever increasing subpar compensation/salary at the banker level."
bad,"Everyone there was extremely rude for the most part and would do and say anything to get you to open accounts not to mention the culture amongst one another was pretty inappropriate. They were dressed up criminals with no class and oddly enough had a way of looking down on people because they had a ""fancy bank job haha"""
bad,"Wells has changed, with all of the problems they have had they have gone off the deepens with reports and scripts! As manager I was asked to put people on performance plans for the littlest infrastructions impacting their incentive. Incentive is based on loyalty from customers, often times corporate policy with this company is what the customers are disgruntled about and the silliness of the policies easily make it 10x harder to get a mortgage with wells than other companies!"
bad,"Just not a great place to work. very cut throat environment.  Bonuses were the best part of the job - bonuses were VERY hard to get.  Culture of caring so they claim, it was not that.  No one was worried about development, or retention of employees.  I was able two advance quickly with the company due to my background in management.  My advancement was mostly based on the connection I had made through various company networking opportunities,  had I not had a background in management and pursued every opportunity it would have been very hard to 'get noticed' and advance."
bad,"I worked here during the account pushing craze. I am told by former coworker that the landscape is different now, and the sales goals hae been dramatically reduced or eliminated."
bad,"There was a tedious training process where you go off site to a classroom. You, along with other trainees, participate in activities and different scenarios to better handle certain situations. Once you're on the job, there are quotas you must meet within the day to send customers to a banker. The management team seemed great until they need you to cover shifts. Even if you input your availability they would schedule you on that day anyways. I started doing poorly in school and missing classes due to scheduling issues. The best thing about working here, was the network you become connected with, to volunteer at multiple events. Whether its at the soup kitchen or an event for kids, it gave you an outlet to easily connect to volunteer opportunities."
bad,I do not wish to complete this section.  The reasons are personal and of no value to what I need this site for. I am currently looking for other employment.
bad,Management has a hard time allowing people who desire to be in management the opportunity. They seem more afraid to let people flourish. Managers who feel threatened by your abilities hold you back. They ask you to be candid then use it against you.
bad,"Working there was a learning experience. For a company that ""values diversity"" I have seen my share of ""inclusion"". I have since moved on to better opportunities."
bad,"When i first started banking it was with Wachovia bank, which was such an amazing experience, manager and staff all cared about out client and doing what right for them. When Wells Fargo took over everything change, they wanted nothing  but number number, causing  stress among manger and staff. stress became so bad that people were leaving left and right and employees started doing thing that would benefit them and not what right for client. I stared this job wanting to make a financial different in people lives, but it got to the point where people were just a numbers game to make goal."
bad,"I personally an not a good salesman so i would never? have never taking a job in sales until WF. Before and upon receiving the job I was under the impression that I was going to a very reputable, honest fortune 500 company that I was going to make a career of. FROM WEEK ONE on the floor ( after you compete the two week computer training) it is cut throat. ALL they talk/ care about is solutions, from morning huddle to the time you clock out you are stressed about numbers. People started cheating to hit the numbers in order to get promoted because that's all the base advancement on. SICK company that I will NEVER work for again"
bad,"Bland work environment, everyone keeps to themselves and no room for growth. I worked there for a little less than six months and during that time I was bored to death."
bad,"I was not hiored by Wells Fargo.  It was Wachovia who hired me.  Wachovia was an excellent company to work for.  Thy did care about thew customers and it was all about excellent customer service, I love that.  Then Wells Fargo changed everything.  It became a numbers game."
bad,"It's been many years since I've worked for the company, however what I've seen today was the same as when I worked there - over aggressive sales goals.  Which appears to have gotten them into trouble recently.  It will be difficult for them to regain customer and regulator confidence."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I get to work with each and every day.  I have a great team.  They are focused and ready to serve the customers."
bad,Sales aspect was ridden so hard you couldn't focus on anything else.  Management was always extremely stressed about hitting numbers and would constantly bend and break rules to make sure their team made goal.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"This company offers a great benefits package and is full of promises for work/life balance. They fall very short in their policies involving compliance and client service. Every process is so bogged down with over-regulation, it's almost impossible to accomplish anything in a timely fashion. This equals frustrated clients and stressed out employees."
bad,"I was not happy with WellsFargo because of the way they treated employees.  low pay, work 7 days a week with no time off and when you do get time off it short"
bad,"At Wells Fargo is very hard to have a career, favoritism is the most important thing in order to advance. Last but not least, working at Wells Fargo is very hostile."
bad,"My current management team and direct reports are some of the best people I have ever worked with. Until recently, dealer services operated off of a decentralized business model. All 57 of our offices were local to their markets, making it easier to understand the areas in which we did business. We were able to drive in business based on our relationships with our dealers. "
bad,"I would not recommend this role for anyone, unless you enjoy working in a call center setting, and spending your days glued to a headset and talking to upset customers for 8 hours, and being scolded for going into ""AUX 2"" unscheduled break mode."
bad,"All they want is for everyone to sell, sell, sell!   Management is horrible and negativity is rampant throughout the company!  I should have known the place was horrible from the day of my interview because I cried for 2 days afterward.  Then I cried my first day on the job and no one cared!  Would not recommend this company to work for!  Some of the unethical things I saw being done were horrible!"
bad,Job is stressful and sales pressure is unreal.  Great team environment in store itself but upper management is horrible. Benefits are good and compensation is average.
bad,The typical work day was very busy. I learned more about the automation process using SSIS packages and Excel spreadsheets. I also became proficient with DB2. The management was fare. The workplace culture was demanding. Getting up to speed with the process and learning the DB tables. The people were enjoyable.
bad,no trust higher ups only worried about them. Gave them my all and sacrificed my family to do so and at the end they didnt care. I worked 50 to 60 hours a week
bad,Management is not in touch with day to day operations. Systems are always changing without logical need. Lower level employees are always left to take the fall when problems arise.
bad,"I have worked for Wells Fargo in a few roles and have found that they are very disorganized with running plans. Many other coworkers who worked with WF previously have stated that it is a company that gives you very little to succeed, and completely blames you when you do not exceed expectations."
bad,"Wells Fargo hires contracted employees because they pretty much think you're disposable. I'm not sure if they start to care more once you're hired on full time, but during my brief stint as a temp, they all but guaranteed I'd be hired on full time, and then ended my contract with absolutely no warning. Same thing happened to two other women I worked with. No warning. These women were even in the process of getting hired on full time."
bad,"Disappointed in this company that I used to consider very prestigious, and have seen the reputation crumble after the Cross Sell practices were outed September 2016 Congressional Hearing."
bad,"Operations used to be valued as an integral part of the company. Now the majority of all cost cutting measures are leveled at operations rather than retail and mortgage, the divisions responsible for most of the bad press.  If you're willing to sell your soul for a pay check, go into retail management, technology,  mortgage or investments.  Just keep in mind that the company has yet to divest itself of its investment in the Dakota Access Pipeline.  If you can sleep with protecting profit margins for something like that, you might do well. Keep in mind also that the reward for work well done with only ever be more work. Don't be fooled by all the sharp internal marketing campaigns, they're very good at making people think their work is valued.  Practice and rewards in pay rate will never match the hype."
bad,they suck they suck they suck what else do you want me to say this is redundant that your making me rate a company i got let go from obviously i am going to give a messed up rating
bad,"Management is out of touch with employees, and simply care about ""numbers"" that will generate income for them. During my time with Wells Fargo I was told that numbers were everything, and that the numbers didn't lie. Management is out-of-touch with the sales perspective as all the media spotlight wrecked my earning potential and coworkers, yet management seemed to not even know or care."
bad,"For such a large company and successful profit margin, they seem very conservative in investing money into applications and systems that could speed up the efficiency of its analysts to be competitive.  the culture is very clicky, meaning if you are friends with the right people then job success will not happen.  Overall I will not recommend working for this company.  The management does not have priorities in line and are more concerned about cutting corners rather than investing in the success and happiness of their team."
bad,"New management was brought in, after their infamous 09/2016 debacle in CA with the lawsuits the company changed entirely on their bonus payout. It doesn't balance out to what it used to pay before."
bad,"Employers doesn't care about its employees, too many hours, not enough benefits. Working in processing may have been one of my most difficult jobs. Too much Overtime. Working there taught me the value of my personal time"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Flexible work schedule, great people working there. must be adaptable to changing environment. My current management is easy to work for- no micro management."
bad,"The systems and technology at Wells Fargo Advisors is absolutely horrible!  The company works on a batch processing system, extremely outdated.  Heavily dependent on paper and manually processes.  Systems do not interface with each other.  Operations is definitely the armpit of the company.  If you want to come to work and listen to music all day on your ear buds, or watch music video's or movies all day long, then this is the company for you.  A lot of cube visiting all day long occurs when management is away at numerous daily meetings.  Pay is subpar for the workers.  However, for management and above up to, and including the CEO, the pay and bonuses are great!  Café food is extremely expensive and horrible!"
bad,wells is the least paying job among its peer companies.  It doesnt matter if you have a degree or not WHO you know gets you promoted.  I actually LOVE what I do but there are supervisors walking around that dont know anything and cannot tell you how to do your job which makes your job more frustrating.
bad,Compensation was based on sales until Fall of 2016. Promotions were also based on sales. I have always performed to a level that met minimum sales requirements or higher. I refused to compromise my ethics and customer service values to be a top performer. Now they have changed the compensation structure to eliminate sales performance. In doing so they have cut my compensation by $8000/yr
bad,Had working flexible hours. Could take off early at times and still would get paid until normal ending time.  All major holidays were recognized with paid time off.
bad,"This company was very much into the numbers, not there employees. Felt like I was just a number. All they cared about was production, checking accounts."
bad,"The Job was stressful, the management is terrible, the sales goals are unreachable, the culture is cut throat and poorly implemented. I would never recommend someone working for Wells Fargo."
bad,"Wells is great for their banker training program, nothing more. You will learn a lot, but there are so many politics and false promises in this company that it is all drama and it makes  you regret coming to work. They also allow anyone that can just sell become a manager, even if they have no idea how to actually manage people - so it makes every one else's lives miserable."
bad,"Overall the job was okay. The team was great, the normal clients were nice. Handled their everyday transactions. Loved the people and everyone I worked with."
bad,"Look, you all know what kind of company Wells Fargo is. My location isn't any better. In the fraud detection department, multiple people were stepping all over each other just to get ahead in the numbers to keep their jobs. Quotas were being raised just to scare us, we were constantly in fear of not hitting numbers that month and being on the chopping block. Just a bad  position overall. Just do yourself a favor, save yourself the stress of working here and save your mental health."
bad,not a bad place to work if you choose. fast paced and very detail oriented. hard to work in a place that talks down to you to get the job done.
bad,"High pressure to meet unrealistic goals, no advancement opportunities, pay scale is lower than any place I have worked. The people that I worked with there made it fun"
bad,When I started to work at Wells Fargo in the Collections Department all the managers seemed very friendly and willing to go out of their way to be helpful. I really felt lucky to be apart of that team. Sadly those smiles and friendly interactions went away fairly quickly after the training period. For those who don't grab the eye of the floor supervisors be grateful because once you get in their sights things will not fair well for you. I didn't experience this myself but many of my coworkers found out the hard way by one female manager in particular. Also always keep in mind there the only person who has your back in you keeping your job is you so be careful of any mistakes. This is the reason they are hiring all the time.
bad,"I have been with Wells Fargo for 6 years and While I am grateful for the job that I am able to come to everyday, I have become stagnate and cannot advance, simply because there are no opportunities available in the Location in which I live."
bad,Terrible Management and company culture.  Managers do not care about you.  You will see them once every other week.  Temps are treated as second class.  Layoffs and managers don't care
bad,I did not like working for welsl fargo very pushy and not customer friendsly had out rangent ssales goals. It was very hard to meet sales goals and they were pushy
bad,"Starting out people are friendly, but as time goes on agressive managers and *old* sales quotas never die, also favoritism and very few opportunity to move up unless your willing to transfer or you are someones favorite. typical day at work consists of being micro managed or having to micromanage someone, having someone breath down your shoulder making sure your saying the *right* things that the management wants to hear you ask the customer, or else you get taken into the office and have a stern talking to. if you don't do what they want, they will make you feel bad and blame it on you."
bad,"It is okay as a stepping stone for something else. Like every company,?it has its pros and cons. I like my fellow coworkers and how they are there for the customer. It's a grey learning experience."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"employees who work hard all day do not get the recognition they deserve.  When they go out on medical leave, their position is given away when they don't heal ""quick enough"" even when they have medical notes from doctors.  The management is horrible"
bad,Sales sales sales. Very stressful 80% of the employees are out of work on medical leave. I wouldnt recommened my worst enemy to work for wells fargo bank
bad,As a branch manager worked every weekend 60+ hours with no appreciation. the environment is hostile to many dirty politics. Hr is a joke overall its not a good place to be if your looking for a career.
bad,Wells Fargo forces it's employees to open account for customer who did not want the product. Caused me to loose a lot of my customer who had followed to the this bank. Management would make you do things that were unethical but would not take any responsibility for what they had us do. Always threaten us with firing us if we didn't do what they told us.
bad,I do no recommend this company on the retail banking side. I am not familiar with the other lines of business. Cross Sell is number one priority over customer needs.
bad,"This company plays favorites, they either like you if you take the fall and dislike you if you stand up for yourself. Sales was a major part of the problem and they would not have your back or help you grow if you did not get them. The company has since gotten rid of their sales quota but they are focused on making money so I am sure they will put something else in place. They would work with school schedules if you can always open or close, or work four days out of the seven for 8 hour shifts. The pay is well compare to other teller positions in the BCS area. I enjoyed a few co workers but you definitely could not trust everyone due to favorites in the workplace."
bad,"like han solo said ""Its all true"" that sums it up. there is no culture, anyone with a clue is leaving or has left. this place will be the poster child for bank break ups."
bad,"All my previous experience was utilized at this position."
bad,"This is a terrible place to work. You are constantly under pressure to perform without mistakes, which is impossible to do. You get some good clients, and some terrible clients who yell at you, and you have no recourse. The management does not back you up, but instead works against you. They discriminate against those who are not within the younger generation. "
bad,"A good company to start with, but has very limited opportunities to grow. Management is terrible and they limit your potential to exceed. Also it is a company drawn on numbers so they will fire you in an instance."
bad,"Not impressed with the timelessness for accommodations . Supervisors are over worked, and over whelmed with the responsibilities of multiple teams. "
bad,"Management creates a hostile and negative work environment. No room for advancement as they play favorites and refuse to promote from within. If you aren't part of their ""click"" they do things to you that are borderline harassment. Customers verbally abuse you all day and you can't do anything about it. DO NOT WORK IN TEMPE AT PREVENTION CONTACT CENTER you have been warned."
bad,"wells fargo does not treat their retail employees well. crazy sales goals, lots of pressure, you have to jump through hoops to get vacation or sick day, lots of micromanagement, and they will lie about promotions and pay raises."
bad,"Employees are not really valued in any department. Like many other jobs, the way you feel about the company depends on management, team/department, and feeling appreciated for your hardwork. A typical day consists of stress, pressure, and high expectation. I learned a lot at the company by going through several different positions and departments to grow. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the horrible morale and sink or swim atmosphere. The training classes mean nothing in regards to the actual job you will be doing, you are usually forced to learn through side-by-sides or figuring things out on your own."
bad,Good benefits... Decent co-workers. Terrible management. The service managers were VERY unprofessional and not experienced to say the least.
bad,Management is friends only doesn't matter how hard you work if you are not friends with the uppers your staying were your at.
bad,"My career was not developed while working at Wells Fargo(Business Direct) my managers over extended my job responsibilities with no acknowledgement of what I contributed to the company, They were more concerned with if we are friends then what the business needs were. The managers and supervisors stressed me out where I had contractions due to stress."
bad,"I've been with the company over 5 years with little to no advancement.  I've strived to get ahead to advance, but the interview process is too stringent and weighted too strongly on how you interview rather than your accrued skills."
bad,"I really wanted to be a long term employee there and progress with this company, but with the expectations of sales, call time, their BAP squad quality overlords, it quickly that it was not going to be with the seemingly gradual elimination of full time employees. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Fun co workers, no advancement. A typical day at work. Great customers, the most enjoyable part of the job. Co workers make the day go by faster, and learning about the customers that come everyday."
bad,"Wells Fargo is withing the top 5 banks in the U.S. However, it all depends on what branch you are placed. It can either be a productive and learning experience or just plain boring and waste of time. I was placed in a branch that had poor managing skills, there was no one that took the time to teach employees anything. Yet, they expected everyone to meet their sales goal."
bad,"Wells Fargo claims that they are not ""sales people"" yet Wells Fargo demands the tellers/bankers offer every customer a product every time they help someone. They say sales are not their goal, but you have a sales goal you must hit every quarter. Wells Fargo claims they want to help everyone succeed, including employees. However, even though you may be the teller with the highest sales number, the best audit score, and no marks against, you still cannot get a promotion unless you blow smoke at the right person. This is one of the worst management structures I've seen along with a very unfair pay scale. I don't speak Spanish, but does that mean I should make a dollar an hour less than someone who does if I'm training them how to do their job to reach my level of performance? Wells Fargo is a hypocritical and unfair employer. The hours are fine and the Sundays off are nice, but don't expect to be treated as anyone's equal while employed here. They will remind you that you are not. You are expendable to them."
bad,One major reason I left was the ethics that the company had. The customer service was not what I thought it should be. Sales were more important than people (employees and clients).
bad,During my many years here I experienced the highest level of stress and the upmost disrespect from higher up management. I went through the whole transition from Wachovia to Wells and never once got praised for the long hours and hard work my team put into it all. They are not a very famiy oriented coproation and work comes before anything there.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers. They where always willing to help. Good Benifits. Not good pay. To add to that management is not good.
bad,"I was the one baker that was there to help you not trick you into getting a 30k loan that i new you could pay off just to make the bank some money, i would sit with my customers for hours if need be and work out what they were wasting money on and how to save more with out getting more loans, the most enjoyable part of this job for me was seeing that i was helping ppl keep there homes and helping them manage there money better, and my pay check was good."
bad,"You cannot trust your co workers nor your managers."
bad,"Hated my time at Wells Fargo, i worked at the branch as a personal banker. One of the most miserable jobs you will ever have.  The want you to push credit cards and checking accounts on customers who have no interest. But at the same time you are forced to put a smile on and have ""perfect 5"" customer service while you do maintenance on their accounts / get bitched at by customers for things that didn't happen in your branch."
bad,"Fast pace environment with in and outbound calls lots of changes, wells fargo did provide training for new changes, working in the collection department had weekly meeting to make sure we are making deadlines."
bad,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
bad,"Wells Fargo is a great bank but I wouldn't recommend applying unless you are into sales. Banking is all about sales and if you do not meet your quota, your managers will come down on you. It's all about sales and pressuring your customers into getting a new account or product."
bad,Had my share of problems with a supervisor who cared more about keeping females happy than anything else and an account manager who never listened to complaints about the supervisor until the account was lost.
bad,"I enjoyed my co-workers and the work I did was interesting, but incompetence was rewarded and management had me working in a job without the title, advising me that only by performing the higher-level work first would I be eligible for the title.  I observed a co-worker who had been doing the job for 2 years without getting the title.  Not every department within Wells Fargo had this issue, and I was paid well, but I have learned that structures and procedures put in place without purpose or thought behind them is destructive."
bad,"micromanagement, work/life balance is skewed, limited opportunity for advancement, management discourages further education."
bad,"The job is a lot of work for such little pay.The company is aware and apparently does not care. High turnover, so back to back calls and lots of micro management. This bank makes great profits each year because they low ball their talent with cheap wages."
bad,"Wells Can be a great place to work, but they tend to lose focus of the customer and more focus on the numbers. This causes agents to loose the focus of the customer and support the customer in there needs and questions and more on what they can sell them or open an account"
bad,"working at Wells Fargo you Strive for sales Goals you are told you will get a bonus but yet to receive one, a lot of  not telling the full truth from managers"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"I learned how to be patient, loved my employees and coworkers, the hardest part of my job was being short staff and long hours"
bad,"Worst job I've had hands down. Work/Life balance does not exist. You're worked like a dog 6 days a week. You have a sales goal to meet every hour of the day and every customer is a victim. You're forced to sell products to people who can not afford them (i.e credit cards, insurance, loans) signing people up for products that they don't want even after they've said no. You're compensated with a quarterly incentive that's very hard to obtain if you're following the rules. Wanna know how to survive as a banker? Every customer that walks in the bank make them open at least 4 checking accounts, 3 savings account, 1 loan and 1 credit card and make sure you tell them everything is free when you know good and well they're going to be hit with tons a fees."
bad,"The job is okay.. You are asked to do many sales a day. Once you have accomplished those goals, you are not rewarded or told you are doing a great job. It starts all over the next day. Reaching goals are difficult to reach depending on the area you are in. Management changes every few months. It gets very aggravating since goals are changed along with the management. You are undervalued unless you look like what Wells Fargo wants you to look like."
bad,Working in the phone bank was a great experience and there were many great people I had the opportunity to work with. I cannot say the same for the other departments I worked for. I learned a lot and I hope to use the skills i acquired in my new role.
bad,"Responsible for selling financial products and services (i.e. Checking, Savings, Credit Cards, CD's, IRA's, Investments, and Home/Auto/Business Loans) to both consumer and small business customers. "
bad,"very time demanding job, can be very stressful dealing with mad customers daily. have to work nights til 9pm as well as some saturdays and sundays."
bad,I was very unhappy there. I didnlt like to see the way clients were treated and employees weren't treated much better.
bad,"Well Fargo don't care about their employee they only care about their money. I understand we have a job to do, but when it comes to management  coming by while you're on phone with a customer and tell you to get your stats up and them putting notes on your desk is beyond belief."
bad,"They are not a very flexible company"
bad,Working with Wells Fargo gave me the ability to help customers become financially educated.
bad,"Company was only about reaching goals and numbers. Customer service was not a top priority. All about sales, sales, sales."
bad,I did not agree with company vision. Company did not seem to put customers needs first and placed to much emphasis on sales quotas.
bad,"I been doing this job for over 3 years at a higher level than my peers but I get a lower title and pay than my white co workers that constantly ask me how to perform their job."
bad,One of the managers is non-friendly and condescending as they come.
bad,"Wells Fargo stresses good customer service but they could care less about the employees. Compensation was minimal and for the work you are asked to do, its definitely not competitive."
bad,"You would think working with money would be stressful when it comes to the customers, but that is so far from the truth. The customers where super friendly and make coming to work enjoyable. Working at this job you learn a lot about financial solutions. Very helpful! But management can be very rude. I loved my co workers! The hardest part is dealing with everything else besides the regular withdraw and deposit. Training really needs improvement. The customers are very pleasant."
bad,"This job is all about the sales, Your Supervisors come around every hour asking how many customers did you have? How many offers did you make? How many sales did you have? Its not about taking care of the customers, its all about how many sales did you get for Wells Fargo."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,did not agree with their culture and the way they dealt with their employees or customers
bad,You will be working six days a week unless you are exceeding your numbers. Schedule and days is based on your production. Can be very hostile.
bad,Great team environment.  Compensation and bonuses are on the low side and it is difficult to survive financially with what they pay unless you are managment.  They make you start from the bottom despite education and work experience and SALES is the number one thing with this company...not the customer...
bad,"Loved my coworkers"
bad,"I was hired to write documentation and after the job started, I was asked to code which is not something I do."
bad,"I am usually a stress free person.  I previously had a very fast paced job and still could go home and feel good about myself."
bad,"HIGH TURNOVER. Very little care for the HUMAN in a person. treated like machines. expected to work 6 days a week. Exempt employees = endless hours. high stress level due to overbearing sales goals and unachievable results without cheating the system. unethical sales practices among many employees. "
bad,"* Bilingual Loan Document Specialist. processing loans. "
bad,"A typical day at work: Sorting/Distributing mail."
bad,A typical day would be taking incoming calls from customers wanting information on checking and saving account.  We would cross sale other products that were offered.
bad,"Great co-works but the company does not care for their employees at all. It is all about numbers. They push for sales on their customer to an extent that it is overboard and upsetting to the customers. They set the bonus extremely high for you fail so they do not have to pay you any extra money but demand you only focus on sales. This way Mr chairmen of the board can cash a 46,000 check every two weeks into his account. They will promise you more hrs and promote you, basically lie to your face. Then go behind you back and hire a newbie for the higher hrs and screw you over, then tell you that you are not good enough/qualified for the hrs or promotion."
bad,Lots of pressure and compensation is below standards. Wells Fargo allows you to owe them as an employee when industry trends reduce production.
bad,the branch I was in was not conducive to growth and learning. I did not feel part of the team.
bad,very rigid environment with super high emphasis on production yet with antiquated systems and redundant tasks that only take away from production.  Over emphasis on meetings and micro managing.  Not very conducive environment for work/life balance.
bad,"An ok place to work, lots of time on the phone. as it is a call center. No opportunities for advancement."
bad,management would push for more even if they know that there was nothing else could be done.
bad,"Wells Fargo has a centralized governing body which doesn't allow for any deviation from it. Is it a fun place to work? No.  Leadership can and does have all the say as to who stays and Leaves. If the employee isn't liked then management will find the reason to fire.  Example: passing quality score is averaged between 8 quality recordings: the passing score is 90% but even if you pass and fail two then you can be written up.  "
bad,Fast paced work environment that is very focused on meeting sales and service goals.  Lots of branches within the Southern California area for position advancement.  A lot of demand on managers with low compensation.
bad,There has been no stability within the bank.  I have had 4 managers in less than a year.  They have fired 4 bankers since I have been at Wells Fargo and we are always short staffed.  Wells Fargo does not care about customers.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"I am a very people oriented person, so When I went to work at a bank I thought this would be perfect. Well Wells Fargo definetly puts on a front for every customer, They are only worried about what they can get out of a customer and the bonus they will get by doing it. Sure the bonus's were nice but sometimes you just have to stop and think wow, They kinda in a way are harrassing these people to get accounts that they dont really want or need.  I got  point that I would ask them and they would say no I would leave it alone and my managers would get mad at me. ""oh you have to talk them into it"" they would say. Well after trying to talk them into it everyday they were getting kinda reluctant to even come in the branch. So I felt like Wells Fargo was not the company I needed to work for."
bad,I came from a competing bank on the recommendation of a friend. I have over three years experience in the banking industry. They micro-manage the hell out of their employees. There is nothing left to the discretion of the bankers--stay away.
bad,"One of the most stressful, low paying jobs I've ever had. High sales quotas must be met in order to keep your job. Short lunch breaks, long hours."
bad,review files mostly conditions run file thru du or LP and make decision based on aus finding . send approval to processor
bad,"Vancouver Call Center was focused on making the workplace a fun environment that was focused on the team and individual growth with-in the company. "
bad,"answer various calls, process loans FHA, Retail, conventional"
bad,"No advancement, dishonesty from every manager I had (with the exception of 1), no job security, forced overtime, favoring blacks and gays for core employment opportunities, faking interviews, blackballing and backstabbing from management. Racism, favoritism, and management corruption."
bad,I took this job thinking I could help people with their finances.  Instead I was put into a very heavy SALES driven environment.
bad,This company does not value it's employees and retaining them. It's a number based business with no value to the opinions of it's employments or management staff.
bad,"great for customer service, and giving a full range of options to help customers with all their finances. The individual goals and branch goals can be high, and very demanding. I've seen other banks treat their employees better, and feel less threatened daily."
bad,This job was Call Center environment with multiple lines at a non stopping paste. It kept you on you toes but it was great helping people when you could plus you had to offer loans to every call to get them interested in more products.
bad,"Started good and slowly moved up learning a lot about the mortgage industry and its operations. Always had a bad reputation for layoffs with every slight change in the market and the work environment really deteriorated over the last several years during and following the economic collapse. Company would probably be better in a more stable political environment as I worked with a lot of good co-workers and managers who mostly valued each other when times weren't as tough. Could be a better place if company's senior leadership and salesforce weren't so disconnected from the little people and understood how to balance workloads and hiring during bigger and bigger refinance booms. I saw far too many good coworkers get laid off or flee the company from the stress and mistreatment so eventually had to finally say goodbye to it myself after several years of trying to adjust and address challenges with a pretty arrogant manager. A bad place to work now unless you're in sales as a banker (then at least you're compensated at least 10 times better). Just read about more layoffs in the thousands from their home mortgage division, so there's that. Just one of those jobs that has benefits you'll never have time to use, lunch at your desk if any at all, constantly changing staff, terrible recognition program, bad behavior rewarded, etc..."
bad,Management wanted you to look at customers as numbers and not people. Only wanted what was right for the company and not the customer.
bad,Good old boys networks is alive and well.  Those with knowledge and strong work ethic are not wanted.
bad,Unhealthy work environment. Not customer friendly and only cares about numbers.
bad,"-Processing documents for various customers. "
bad,I did mindless and stupid tasks and it was a huge waste of time
bad,"unless you need a job, don't work here, management is all over the place, they push product on every customer...it you don't want the pressure of job on the line, don't go here. Banking has lost its way."
bad,"I loved the people at Wachovia "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Processed deposits and withdraws for customers
bad,"Drawing Loan documents, review signed loan documents for funding"
bad,"get my ""cash box"""
bad,This company is considered a place to work. They do not value their employees and the employees has to pay for parking just to come to work.
bad,Worst turnover I have ever seen. You do not feel like a Banker. You feel like a Used Car Salesman.
bad,"there was always so much confusion at this place. it was very unorganized. if you would go ask one manager a question, and then go ask another manager the same question, they would have two different answers for you. also while i was there i was a temp so thats where i say i didnt like the job security there. they would hire and fire people left and right for little to no reason."
bad,Personal banking at a branch was not a good experience for me. Hard sell tactics.
bad,Customers and co-workers are generally great to work with on any given day. Feeling of failure if you don't meet the requests/number of Wells Fargo.
bad,Imposiable to advance with in the company .
bad,"-Work 3 Saturdays a month, no ifs-ands-or-buts about it"
bad,All management cares about is there own job. That's the corporate way.
bad,Insurance Overload Staffing
bad,Management team was not good. Low praise high pressure environment.
bad,"very stable at first then turned into a constant change of jobs and managers. Management pretended nothing was going on even when my desk was moved to another floor. High turnover. We made our own fun. I left for a job that paid $7,000 more and did not require a degree (although I had one). Managers were promoted based on who they knew and how long they had been with the company rather than degree. You were allowed 5 sick days a year and was written up after 3 absences regardless of dr note, etc."
bad,"The company itself was great, the management was undertrained and one each day ther was a different method to doing your job then the following week it would go back to the original way. it seems the were trying to fix a wheel that was not broken. I would suggest Six Sigma training for the management of this department."
bad,A typical day started lining my employees up with goals and requirements for the day. Handling all disgruntled customers and all personnel problems that would arise. Attending scheduled meetings with upper management and implementing all procedures given to my department.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"My time with Wachovia was pleasant in some reapects yet quite different with Wells Fargo. (Wells Fargo bought Wachovia) There were pay increases, benefits were good and there was school reimbursement from the beginning."
bad,"A typycal day at work is just on the phones, correcting errors, ordering new docs. The most enjoyable part of my job is speaking to people who wants help."
bad,Found the Wells Fargo companies level of work loads unrealistic for one person to complete
bad,Very poor management skills with that of the upper managers. Lack professionlism with employees. The department uses unethical pratices within daily performance of the staff.
bad,"Can not really recall, been too long. Hours were long and team leader were not informative"
bad,Once Wells Fargo took over Wachovia the morals of the company seemed to have left along with it. What use to be a fair place and fun to work suddenly became a nightmare and was unreal how stressful it got.
bad,"will not discuss prior employer, will not disparage, etc. as do not feel it is appropriate. no comments as had good and bad aspects but not to be made public by me"
bad,"Daily routine is taking care of any administrative duties, call prospective and current  customer offering them products and services that the bank offer. Take care of any walk in customers of financial needs and present them to the right products or departments."
bad,"It is one thing to have a Challenge job that helps you improve your skills and grow. But this job was nothing like that it had too many deadlines very stressful and management has no interest in working in your interest as long as job gets done. Also, there is not much encouragement or transparency towards changing your department."
bad,"Management will always push you to open accounts for clients that haven't expressly asked for/ even wanted a new account (just to reach sales goals). If you DISAGREE with management, you will not likely be reviewed for promotion opportunities or for further advancement. Not to mention, if you take a sick or personal day, they treat you as if you have no work ethic whatsoever. "
bad,"Very underpaid for the amount of work"
bad,"If your a Manager be prepared to micro manage your staff all day, everyday. District manger was horrible to work for. Very condescending and fake. Enjoyed the employees I worked with, but the hours and the stress of upper management wasn’t worth it. The training they give you when your hired is also a Joke. Consist mostly of doing observations, one-on-one’s and huddles with your staff. They was very little content on the operational part of your job and the computer system (which also needs to be updated) you learn in the branch as you go."
bad,NA - This is a good first starter job if your looking to get your foot in the door. People were nice and culture was laid back. Most difficult was obtaining sales goals.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job are the customer interactions. The tellers are experienced and pleasant. Working Saturdays is expected with a half day off provided to add up to 40 hours.
bad,Limitless opportunities to growth.  Must be willing to put in the time and dedication to advance.  There are limitless areas of growth with varying specialties.
bad,"Provide customer service and source applications. Input customer information, order credit bureau reports, analyze history and income to determine loan eligibility. Adherence to policy and procedures, maintain a high level of customer service, timeliness and data entry. Home Mortgage Consultant (HMC) is responsible for producing high quality loans that meet Wells Fargo Home Mortgage guidelines by building relationships with realtors, builders, financial professionals, bank stores, past customers and other nontraditional sources, while providing excellent customer service."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"The management could do a better job at caring about their employees, very little incentives (actually none), a lot of micromanaging within each branch, no help from back office and the pressure of having to offer products that will take over our jobs is very exhausting"
bad,There wasnt anything that stood out. Bad experience working for them. Wouldnt go back. No reason to waste mine or their time with training again. Unhappy with work from beginning to end. Left bad taste for the company.
bad,"The absolute worst company I’ve worked for. The pay was okay, however management and staff were rude. It was not a healthy work environment, growth was frowned upon, and work moral showed."
bad,"I would not recommend working For Wells Fargo- in retail banking. It is stressful and you never get recognized for the good work you do. You can show up well to work, and still they find something to make you feel like an unvalued team member. There are so many changes, which is understandable, however, they ask WAY too much."
bad,"Management had poor communication, pay was good. The company was great all around, nice fundraising, provided help when needed. Just had poor communication within management."
bad,Very fast paced pace with competing deliverables and over reaching management.  New management tool is difficult to use and contractors get no training on the tool.
bad,Management is a joke and refuses to help. Also trying to make someone work 6 days a week multiple weeks in a row is a joke. The leaders in the area are not cooperative and refuse to even show up to the branch that needs the most help out of the branches in middle Tennessee. Team members get bonuses for good customer service but this branch doesn't see it because of long lines due to being understaffed which means a bad review from a customer.
bad,Contract roles were eliminated in California for this business unit. Not much deliberate culture. Management is passive and technology is generally behind the curve.
bad,"One of the more mercenary corporate experiences I've had, especially in regard to management."
bad,Great career start for students but very little pay for the workload. I was forced more so to make sales to the customer over doing great at my job which satisfies a customers immediate needs.
bad,Wells Fargo has generations to go to fix their culture and I don’t believe we have seen their rock bottom yet.  If given the choice don’t work for them.
bad,"My coworkers were nice, even the managers were kind.  But the compensation wasn't worth the emotional abuse from customers at all."
bad,80-120 calls a day helping customers with any banking request they need assistance with. would be responsible for all consumer debit type servicing and also online banking service assistance for customers.
bad,"good company to work for. Job Work/Life Balance"
bad,I started off as a teller and while at initial branch i was lucky enought to have great managers who seen my potential and quickly promoted me to personal banker. As a personal banker i was also lucky to have a supportive manager who also promoted me to HLO it was on the home loan center were everything went down hill with lack of management and leadership
bad,"I have worked for B of A, Jp Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Each bank has their own pros and cons but Wells Fargo stands alone on how it treats its employees. The pay is LESS than both companies mentioned above and advancement from within is chosen by favorites not skill. So if you work here and plan to move up, play nice and keep your chapstick near so that the bottom kissing doesn't chap your lips."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,This company isnt the best. Chances are you get thrown away if you happen to be a temp. Not enough actual work to keep you busy. I would much rather say to stay away from the company
bad,My branch manager would prohibit us from using our sick days and PTO without a proper reason  but himself leave the branch for personal reasons during work hours. When this was reported to the district manager no action was taken because of favoritism.
bad,"My main issue was management. They say one thing but do something completely different. They make promises that never come to fruition. It's demoralizing to say the least. There's no development to speak of. It's all on your shoulder and then, maybe, you get to put your knowledge to work. And the work is pretty mundane despite all the talk about ""new thinking"" this and ""cutting edge"" that."
bad,You can work very hard for this company and not get any credit for anything even though they like you to recognize other people and make sure that it's all about the customer service but shouldn't be customer service start with how they treat their own employees they might start you out at a decent pay but you cannot get in creases very often as well as you're judged on everything they encourage gossip
bad,"With a very fine line between success and failure, there were no guide rails to help you succeed. If a mistake happened on your shift or your team then you pay the price. You must always keep an eye over your shoulder for management to be watching you for mistakes."
bad,"The work was exciting and interesting. The environment was dehumanizing. My manager was unapproachable, she was offsite and made it known that she was only interested in making it known that you work for her but support and guidance was to be found elsewhere. The admin would literally take attendance by your login to Skype. It was a very humiliating & juvenile experience."
bad,OK place to workBut wasn’t consistent enough with honesty and integrity. The company yourself forces you to reach out to people in poor demographics to put them into checking or savings accounts with these people can’t afford to maintain accounts that you are selling now
bad,"It seems that it doesn't matter how much work and how much of a top performing employee you are, there will always be politics and favoritism towards other team members for promotions and raises."
bad,Its a very quite environment where there are teams off the phones mostly processors or other analytical work. Louder in other areas where team members are with phone teams. Phone teams have a more upbeat team environment where as more analytical teams are more calm pre-say. Café has decent vendor and there is seating inside and outside. There is also plenty of breakrooms throughout the building. This is a ping pong table in the main lunch room next to café.
bad,"There’s no accountability when it comes to their management. Their managers are allowed to create toxic work spaces by promoting work gossip, favoritism and unrealistic work expectations and expect you to thrive in such a situation. My Direct was an outside manager who worked her roll for 3 years. She knew the same about her roll on her 3 years anniversary as she did they say she was hired. She provided to guidance, no help with difficult situations orattmeltemed to prompted her team."
bad,"Unenthusiastic,  people were rude and don’t talk with you unless your in their “click” overall a terrible place to work , high pressure sales goals , terrible pay way under market value "
bad,"Crooks, the poor customers are not even aware how much they have been stolen from by this company. Their hiring process is a joke, their interview packets the pathetic managers read from are beyond ridiculous! And their turn over rate is asinine but they have zero cares In the world because we are all just a number."
bad,Still sales driven by numbers. the company has merely changed the verbiage with a lot of qualitative sounding euphemisms. There are many more team meetings now but it seems more to be in order for middle management to feel out the team members' current mindset. All of the talk is about putting the customer first but the action is not.
bad,"I would not recommend Wells.   The collections group was fantastic, however the auto funding group was the worst experience of my life.   Mandatory overtime, horrible management, and a combative culture was enough for me to take a significant pay cut to get out of there."
bad,WF is crooked from the core out. We got paid 4$ less an hr saying well the bonus is 2k a month. 3 months after starting they took bonus away. Very retroactive instead of proactive. Management would say we can't judge you off modifications but if you don't get this many your written up. So they played us all. My department went from 140 people to 3 within 12 months. They lay off as much as Chase. You are truly a number to them. Nothing else. The stress and bad management spills out onto the floor.
bad,"The experience with Wells Fargo depends on an individuals ability to overlook certain things and their personal outlook on situations. "
bad,"I was hired at the height of the pushing sales at all costs mentality. I was previously in sales positions while in high school, during college where goals were required, but never like what I went through at Wells Fargo. None the less when i was hired I was excited to have my first banking job, Wells Fargo was looked upon to be one of the best! "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Poor management, no job security, employees are treating like numbers, and the pay is way below what it should be...only redeeming quality is excellent benefits."
bad,"I was hired on to contribute to chatbot development.  A decision had been made prior to my employment to move from a Java-based NLP/ML platform to Python.  Upon starting my position, I began reviewing both the Java and Python code to get a sense of where things stood.  My manager dissuaded me from spending time on the Java code over the Python code, as I had been hired primarily to work in Python for NLP.  As my Java experience was much more limited than my Python experience, I was fine with this directive.  However, it turned out much later that I needed to basically translate the Java code into Python, and, per that initial directive, was far behind the curve on the Java side (I hadn't even been allowed to set up the Java environment properly to run the Java code).  My impression was that my manager had not anticipated this development, which seemed quite predictable, although I'll admit I didn't push it.  On the Python side, the codebase was very exploratory, with just a few notebooks developed.  Furthermore, I had spent a lot of time curating the data because I found that too much of it was appearing in both training and test/validation sets.  Anyway, my contract expired after 6 months, and I was happy to move on."
bad,"Fun environment"
bad,ok place. The day to day tasks involved interviewing applicants and meeting with hiring managers to understand the needs to find out what positions needed to be filled.
bad,"Very pace environment.  Very sales driven even though you are not on the sales team.  No room for advancement, especially if your manager does not like you.  Management team in all departments are very cliquish."
bad,"The have good ideas and mottos in place, but the execution of them needs a lot of work. Management doesn't know how to do the jobs and when we tried to explain what we do to improve the process little was done. People were often stressed out and it affected their health. First job I had were ambulances came to the building at least 1-2 times a year. The opportunities for advancement or career advice are limited although they have several models and guidelines in place. Not enough perks for it to be a big company and so production driven. They pay you to volunteer and they match investing in 401K up to a certain amount which were the best perks."
bad,"I've worked for Wells Fargo for over 6 years and I left the company due to management. So many un-ethical behavior has happened from belittling employees and bullying by branch managers when your constantly remind that this job is given to you and your are a replaceable object. HR doesn't do anything to managment or DM, it doesn't matter how long you stay with this company and if you're not a manager and have an issue they will gladly hold the doors for you to leave instead of a manager having an type of discipline."
bad,my main review would be about the culture in wellsfargo and with its employees which is not as you would expect. It needs to be changed for the good and managers should have some sort of training.
bad,"Not a sales position I was looking for. I have been a commission based employee my whole career and this was just an hourly position. If the hourly rate was much higher, I would have stayed. Thank you"
bad,The environment was hard to work in due to management. They micromanaged the team and we had no area to grow. The hours changed frequently and having to work holidays made it hard on my family and I.
bad,Wells Fargo's competitive advantage is completely a function of it's size.  Service to the customer and attention to detail are nonexistent.  Very little sense of teamwork or cooperation.
bad,There are many people in management roles that are in their roles by circumstance vs by knowledge and skill set. Wells Fargo is an old dog that cannot and is has no interest in learning or practicing new tricks.
bad,I love what I do but not who I do it for.  I don't feel like I am an asset and I'm looking for jobs outside of Wells Fargo to grow in my career and give back to another employer.
bad,"Most managers think they know it all and treat you like a child. Feels like high school with the fear of being fired like at any time. Constant feedback or NO feedback. Tell me everything instead of just some of what my performance is really like Wells Fargo. They need to get managers that DON'T colludes together!"
bad,"Very little work life balance "
bad,"After working there for 14 years, I have seen the steady decline from a customer focused company to a profit at all costs company. The meritocracy of old, being promoted based on KSA's, has been replaced by nepotism. Through the vast amount of acquisitions since 2008, managers kept on from the failed banking institutions have promoted their former staff above those who have done their time in the trenches."
bad,Wells Fargo showed a lot of favoritism towards customers that has more money in the bank. Many times we had to stay open after five for customers with a larger balance verses a customers that only had a few bucks in the bank.
bad,Production at any cost became the driving factor at Wells Fargo.  They somehow lost sight of true customer service and work life balance for team members.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"There are a number of things we could do here that would increase efficiency, but WF is too corporate for their own good. There is little input allowed or encouraged by the staff to implement changes"
bad,"Basically on call 24/7 as a mortgage consultant. Draw versus commission not fair. I have been a professional in this business for 35 years and a salary would be more appropriate. being paid $12 an hour not fair with demands of the job. Too many interruptions in a scheduled day by on line training and videos and conference calls. Could not succeed with these interruptions. I greatly appreciate the training and innovative training regarding sales that I will always have with me. Being around other employees with such negativity was difficult as well. Difficult to walk in public and have my on my Wells Fargo name tag and have total strangers approach me with their negativity regarding Wells Fargo. My immediate manager was one of the best I have ever had however, the upper management not supportive. Upper management only interested in numbers and production not the actually needs of my customers. Very impersonal and that is not why I've been in the mortgage industry for so long. I did make some life long friends but left a job I love due to lack of support and anxiety and stress for little pay for my skills."
bad,I am glad I left before they were exposed for the illegal activities with customers accounts. The culture there was sales before customer. I am not surprised.
bad,"High Call Volume, Very fast pace, Dealing with customer issues and concerns. Very team oriented, training and help from supervisors when needed. Questions are welcomed by upper management and very goal orientated as well."
bad,Typical corporate cronies protecting mid level jobs. Couldn’t see forest through trees mentality.  I liked my super but he had to play along.  Became an ops driven company. Definitely not customer centric or forward thinking.  Always trying to keep up with technology and competition but lagging in ability to win in a competitive environment.  They will succeed just because big  not good and that is the attitude.
bad,this place is a joke. I worked here from 2013-2018 in both service and sales. I've seen it all. You can make a movie out of the stuff that happens here
bad,"There's a lot of bureaucracy which gets frustrating, management doesn't communicate with employees on the frontlines all that well. Usually not enough help at times which leaves people at edge taking on responsibilities  which aren't theirs."
bad,"Wells Fargo is a corporation...  They want production, production, produtction, although the vision to ""be there for the customer"" (essentially).  Their real goal is to produce, just like any  business, but I feel as thought it's an 'image' only...."
bad,I was only at the company for 5 months. We worked on a project to satisfy a government audit.  The project was halted midway through and Well paid the required fine.  i don't have much more to add
bad,I did learn a lot about banking working at Wells Fargo. It was a very hard company to work for in a very small community. I left for a job at our local credit union.
bad,"Working  for Wells Fargo will hurt you, they are an infamous bank that has truly earned its status. They will spend 25m on a marketing  campaign, and turnaround  and say they can't afford to fully staff the bank. Everyday you will pay the penance for their crimes, quite literally. You will be told of the advancement  opportunities, but there are no openings, and when there are you will be passed up because they can't afford to lose you in your position to fill another"
bad,Great people to work with. Pay and compensation were ok. They had us train a new office to then lay off about 75% of the company. Can’t trust management completely.
bad,"If it wasn't for the ability to telecommute, I would not work for this company...It isn't what you know, or your level of skill set, but it's who you know.  There are too many people in this company that don't have a clue as to what they are doing, but they know the right person, and their position is safe because of that."
bad,"The call center closed but I ended up leaving due to medical issues. I originally was okayed to leave and take my time off, but some inconsistencies with management and whomever they talked to after all the phone calls I was deemed “not  rehirable” I would pass up anyways and go to a better bank, one that doesn’t dabble in skrewing customers over"
bad,"I learned a lot with this company, but didn't feel valued. This company kind of pins people in places and situations that really don't make you get ahead."
bad,Wells Fargo would be a great place to work for if they had better management on the shift that I worked.  My manager was very unprofessional. She spoke to the Hispanics in Spanish and they spoke very good English. She was very rude and she didn't know how to talk to people.  The turnover rate was too high because of her.
bad,"very stressfull, managers are behind your back every minute."
bad,"They hired too many new people and didn't have the call volume to support them all so hours were cut."
bad,Conclusions are random occurrences that prolong affiliation with the nomenclature of silent adverse reactions to the sequentially observed amalgamations
bad,"I have worked at Wells Fargo for the last four years. I also worked for Wachovia. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,No one communicated well to know what others were doing. The environment was stressful and the pay didn't fit the job. A lot of times leaving work was a relief.
bad,I feel the upper management is leading Wells Fargo in the wrong path. My position was extremly stressful. I feel like the culture at Wells Fargo is very poor
bad,"Training provided is adequate."
bad,It was very hard working there due to upper management production pressures and the mandatory overtime.  The meetings were excessive such that you didn't have time to work on your loans.
bad,It was a very fast pace on the phone. Goals to meet. Everyone one worked together as a team and individually. Working in a big group you learn to deal with different persoanlly and work together as a team to get the job done
bad,"I was a teller, My immediate supervisor was a micro manager. So it made the job environment unbearable. My coworkers were nice for the most part. However some were very competitive and liked to create drama."
bad,"Wells Fargo paid a ton of money for my out of town training.  As soon as the training was complete, all the loan officers for Wells Fargo in this area quit.  Rates were high and nobody wanted to continue employment."
bad,Mandatory overtime every week. You will be penalized if you cannot work OT. Management does NOT communicate well with employees. Best part of the job is the free water and the free ice cubes. The cleaning staff never vacuums under your desk pods and the bathrooms are always filthy. The cafeteria never has healthy food and it is overly expensive. Management favors their favorite employees.
bad,Go into work and hit the same 15 keys for 8 hours. It was boring unless you had headphones and music. The bosses also would stare daggers are you if you spent a moment taking a breath
bad,Log into phones and take calls in queue back to back until break time which was 4.5 hours later and then you log back into the phones and take back to back calls until lunch/dinner time after 6 hours. then log back into phones and take back to back calls till the end of your shift.
bad,"They will work you like a dog and managers/supervisors will stab you in the back so that they look better to their managers."
bad,When I worked for Wachovia things were pretty good but went downhill when Wells bought them out. Wachovia was a client centric company and did what was in their best interest but Wells is a company centric  company and does what is best for the company.
bad,"In the department I work for, there is not sufficient management guidance and knowledge. The hardest part of my current job is not having proper support and resources to effectively get my job done effectively and efficiently"
bad,The hardest part is watching the management mistreat employees and use policies to keep people from enjoy the work environment or from using their benefits. They also over work employees by closing down departments to save money and adding those jobs to other departments and not even giving proper raises.
bad,"I don't really want to write a review but working at Wells Fargo was ""okay."""
bad,"When I worked there it was crazy.  The amount of sales you were expected to get was astronomical.  Customers hated being sold to, but you were forced to follow a script.  Dumb"
bad,"I was only a contract employee with Wells Fargo so I did not receive any benefits, vacation pay or sick pay.  It was a very stress full work environment and I was always reminded that because I was only a contract employee I was not eligible for any of the benefits the company had to offer."
bad,"Nice people to work with, they just don't pay very well. It was hard to get promoted so I had to leave the company for another opportunity. The pay is not competitive."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Overall not a good or positive experience. It is hard to get support with career advancement. The amount of additional work needed to get a nominal promotion is over the top.
bad,No trust was placed in the people actually doing the job. Every action was reviewed by multiple levels and if they did not agree with your decision you were dinged.
bad,"Management was poorly manage at that time, our manager had favoritism and will choose whoto give holidays off and morning hours too. It wasa bad experience, working with a manager that had no professional manners in the work environment."
bad,"it always depends on if your manager like you or not. the managers didn't help me growth at all, they wanted me to admit that they were smarter than me"
bad,"Due to the changes in management in a short period of time, many of the process and expectations within the environment shifted resulting in a great deal of confusion and frustration.  This created an environment best described as cut-throat."
bad,This company is not professional.Nor is management competent in any way. If you are on the phones you are overworked and under appreciated. The managers and company create unrealistic goals for you that you couldn't possibly attain.
bad,"I left this company after 13 years, the last 12 of which were supporting a single application. Things were great for a long time, but in the past 5-6 years, our workload increased and kept increasing. "
bad,"Wells Fargo is pretty busy almost everyday.  With big clients to deal with, we have to ensure to give them good customer service.  Management is great.  The workplace is busy, everyone is busy taking care of clients by phone or walk ins."
bad,"Not a lot of TEAM effort in the Company"
bad,you did not have the support you needed and in a sales position the operations side was overworked and did not have the support they needed to produce
bad,"There was pressure to manage people out of their positions.  I have never worked for a place where my boss had no experience in what we did.  On a positive note, they provided a great deal of training."
bad,Company had lots of difficulty defining their culture after the Wachovia acquisition.  They made staff to be robotic and follow a roadmap explicitly.  Every day was only focused on sales & not so much taking care of the customers needs.  There was a lot of change in management & promotions were given to people who executed exactly what they wanted.  The regional director was not very nice or approachable.  This was NYC 2012.
bad,"There are ethical issues at Wells Fargo. The people at my branch were wonderful, but the tone at the top was to push sales regardless of customer situation."
bad,"They tend to hire people who lack experience and knowledge (cheaper for them), therefore if you are someone with skills and knowledge you can expect to have to carry the others as well as do your own work so it adds a lot of extra work."
bad,very unorganized for a big organization.. was hired as a customer service rep and was trained for sales..  Moved to a transfer agent for half the year and student loans forthe other half.  Great concept but no advancement for that position.
bad,14 Years of Employment should have respected more or something to Employers. jest to be laid off started a unemployment that has not recovered. The mental stress and strain is jest unbearable to live with.
bad,It was an okay company to work for. Benefits were good but they are strict on their policies. Management was good. I was only their for a year. They did offer a lot of training.
bad,I am not going into much detail.  No room for advancement like they have said  and promised. And it is definitely not worth the pay for all that you do.
bad,I was not pleased with the management at this company. thy micro manage you and do not appreciate your service to the company. your work is over looked
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,The daily work duties were easy but the sales pressure was terrible. I constantly felt my job was being dangled in front of me if I didn't meet certain quotas. Unless you were the top sales employee in the district they didn't even consider you for openings within the company. No raises were given either.
bad,"They don't know what they are doing, Management says do to one thing one day but everyone is told something different, then later, they change there minds. It's a constant he said she said for protocols."
bad,"truly miserable experience with a terrible manager who wasn't helpful in anyway and made me hate my job because of her lack of leadership, Toxic work environment"
bad,"I believe in a very strong work ethic. I love to make sure my customers are always satisfied throughout the loan process. Unfortunately, money was the driver with Wells Fargo and not so much on customer service."
bad,process loans. management not supportive. no team effort. Difficult to have information provided.management unavailable.formed some lasting friendship
bad,"It is what it is, under no circumstances would I ever recommend working here unless you absolutely have to.  Get out as soon as you can and find someone that values talent."
bad,"Inshort Wells Fargo is one big corporation where most management is more concerned with procedure and covering thier own hides, rather than put the customer first."
bad,Their image over the past few years tells enough about this company. I'm forced to place more characters in this field. So now I'm just taking up space.
bad,I enjoyed being a Teller more then a Personal Banker. Less stressful because of sales quotas placed by management. It became worse when they would constantly ask daily for friends or family to open accounts.
bad,"At the time I worked at Wells Fargo, management had a difficulties on how goals should be achieved. As a life-long sales professional I felt the moral challenge and work/life balance were not a good fit."
bad,Contract role that the firm claimed could be full time but they let everyone go.  Managers were overbearing and not efficient in providing proper advice.
bad,"unattractive compensations"
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was working 7am to 330 pm. It was a stressful work environment with limited growth opportunities if you did not have a supportive manager.
bad,"Operations is an important part of the team, that it is critical to have great communication because they tend to be in the accounts longer then the sale team.  Watching over my budget and making adjustments that will keep us in the black as well as keep the brands visibility in the streets.  Most importantly running data on sales through three different programs, focusing on trends, forecasting of products both new releases and current products and being able to share that with my team.  While in my last position I had 3 Trade Activation Managers and One sales rep under me directly.  I communicate on a daily bases with 17 sales reps about the current situation of the accounts"
bad,"I dont have anything good or bad to say about wells fargo, they lost me as a great employee to something so simple and that could have been handled..."
bad,"This is a sales job and with Wells Fargo there is no room for error. The processing is terrible and they know it, which is why they are working on fixing it. Unfortunately it will take more time. The compensation plan is completely demotivating  and I was one of their top bankers as well. "
bad,"Promise your employees everything but give them nothing! "
bad,"Banking should not include sales pitches from employees. managers pushed employees too hard to sell products to customers because they were pressured to have high numbers. Training on general banking information was great, but having to sell products in a bank felt forced, fake and at times dishonest."
bad,I’m not a fan of this company. Managers don’t seem to know anything and just refer you to call back office for most of the questions that come up. Everything is about numbers and metrics. And I feel force to have to try to get customers to sign up for things.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"When I first started at Wells it was great. Sr Leadership is running the place into the ground, and they have no game plan. Middle management is overworked and not given direction with the expectation to make things better without the opportunity to make necessary changes. Have cut the workforce and moved underwriting jobs to mega centers."
bad,"Despite the PR and Marketing expenditures going through the roof, nothing can erase the view of a relentless profit seeker. If you look deep, down within, you will still see that the beast is well and alive, despite ridding itself of Sales goals. Goals are a proxy for performance that proved so easily manipulated, and no longer available as a measuring stick so managers will need to be a lot savvier in judging their staff."
bad,"Due to the public company problems, the employees are taking the brunt of the impact. Lots of layoffs and no room to grow. Bonuses are hard to reach since the expectations that are given are unreasonable. Management constantly gives new guidelines to follow but no explanation as to why and no understanding of the guidelines which causes delays in the process. Department I was under was advised that there is no room to grow which was hard for many to hear. Morale was very low and no answers were ever given to the hard questions that were asked. The only consistent answer is that they were in the business to make money which to the employees meant that what they thought had no impact on their decisions."
bad,I managed up to 12 employees to facilitate the process for in-bound and out-bound funds transaction. I did employee reviews and handled HR related inquiries.
bad,This company using a top down style of thinking. Employees have very little input. Extremely compartmentalize and departmentalize. The company has very little communication between lines of business.
bad,I feel the managers should start giving higher bonuses to the employees and not the upper management team. The morale is bad and equal rights for all isn't true for Wells Fargo Bank.
bad,"Worked many jobs at the bank.  At the end many jobs were relocated to NC or sold to other companies.  sI was a teller, domestic collections rep, return items clerk, dispute analysis and work with stocks and bonds."
bad,"If you are ok working your life away, then this may work for you. I would not go back to working there, yes the pay is good, but not worth it for me! Xx"
bad,"Helped customers."
bad,"I love the work environment, I worked with some outstanding people. I have learned a lot of things from this company. If you are lookinf for growth in a company Wells Fargo is the way to go."
bad,Worked as a teller at a very busy Wells Fargo teller.  This was a high volume branch.  Worked here while waiting a computer job.  Hardest part of this job was balancing my draw at the end of the day.
bad,"at the time i was employed there management was all over the place and the environment on the floor was too ""high school."" you had grown adults up in there stirring the pot with one another and in my experience, the care for my career development was fraud like unto those extra accounts WF was signing people up for ""unbeknowingstly?"" didn't care to share but you asked for it and that is just my truth."
bad,I worked for Wells Fargo a very long time ago when things were at there most unethical. Although the company pushed me to become a strong sales person there was no work life balance. I worked 12 hour days because it was my choice and I wanted to advance but overtime was never offered.
bad,"They hire too many and then lay everyone off and break promises. I spent 12 years and got laid off. Just this July 2018, people who been there 17 and 19 years just got laid off."
bad,I love my work friends. Management is partial to certain people. Diversity is not prevalent in certain positions. Team morale could be a lot better. Pay increases could be more comparable.
bad,"Contractor ideas were discouraged early on in this project, later minimized in favor of management or other internal associate ideas.  Feedback was often requested and then quickly dismissed.  This department was clearly locked in institutional thought. Not sure why a firm hires outside talent and not utilize it."
bad,"Expected to work like a machine."
bad,"Though the job pays well, it is a stressful environment. Difficult to do  your job due to micro management style and constant changes in credit policy. There are long periods of required overtime (months at a time), including 10-12 hour days and Saturdays. Not your typical 9-5 bank job."
bad,"At Wells Fargo I was a contractor. Overall the work atmosphere was pleasant. The most difficult part of the job, was the commute that was literally cross town and a separation between full time and contract workers. For instance, contractors would not be invited to a team / holiday luncheon or company event.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the new Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) technology and the amazing people I worked with everyday! On my birthday I arrived to find my cubicle covered in streamers and balloons. That says a lot for the people."
bad,"In my time at Wells, I was promised overtime and Career advancement...that is unless you're good at your job..then all of those promises are out the window."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Wells Fargo - worked in Commercial Real Estate.  Worked with great people.  However, I was only in this position for approximately six months.  I wanted a career in Treasury Management and accepted a position at Minnesota Bank & Trust."
bad,Company bought Wachovia. and immediately the changes were overwhelming. Many of the customers were complaining about the way their accounts were being handled. Some changes were not as bad but others caused customers to close their accounts.
bad,"Management is instructing us that our objective is to “make it happen” for our customers, but based off the day to day at the Home Mortgage facility, if something goes array, we are more focused on who is to blame rather than a resolution which does not benefit our borrowers and causes closing delays.  If the applicant were to use another lender, they would have a higher probability on closing on time.  We may be able to beat other lender’s rates, but the experience is lacking."
bad,"No matter how hard you worked, if upper management did not like you they would find a way to fire you, no matter how many times it took. They will even fire you, before verifying your FMLA"
bad,"Very difficult to please these people. Nothing is ever good enough. Any excuse is used to rake you over the coals, while their own people are scamming and performing illegal actions against their own customers."
bad,In the beginning i assumed this job was for me because i like dealing with money and people but then I realized im working for a company that isnt about the customers needs more so about pushing sales.
bad,I have been in sales since college and love the competitiveness and culture.  It has been removed here and along with that a lot of upper management positions have been eliminated and I am now stuck in my role and bored.
bad,I do not with to comment on this.  This  changed as the company went in different directions.   Sales and operations did not have a good working relationship.
bad,There was no room for advancement.  upper management would not help you in order to achieve your goals.  Compensation was really bad. Very high stressful environment ridiculous sales goals to hit
bad,I would not work for this company again.  The staff were unprofessional and the managers were disengaged.  Not a lot of transparency and illegitimate transactions were taking place.
bad,"management was poor and employee moral was very low, constant changes in policy. they was too much favoritism, and managers was having relationships with various employee"
bad,This company would tell me that I was over qualified for the team I was on but never provided opportunities for advancement or any type of model in preparation for advancement. The upper level management would play favorites and only assisted those who they saw potential.
bad,"It's an individuals preference as to where they elect to work. Whatever job you may have, make it work for you. If its not working; then perhaps its time to move on."
bad,"I was hired as a project manager, and then discovered that I was supposed to use personnel from another team that was already working 50 hours/week.  The Manager didn't seem to understand why projects were behind."
bad,"The work day starts at regular banking time, once per week there is a meeting to discuss goals and plans for future. Also any questions or difficulty's the team may have. There is a lot of pressure from management to get new account.The best part of the job was some if the customer. The culture was some what supportive but could be difficult as well."
bad,"wells fargo  gives an incredible level of exposure to people at the analyst and senior analyst role. It is an exciting company with lots of interesting projects happening across the various lines of business. There is generally a strong development culture, good pay, and a good work life balance. The McLean campus is adding a beautiful new building in summer 2018 which is a great perk."
bad,Terrible management and the company doesn't seem to be very diverse.  Regardless of the experience minority  gets paid less than the white employees and quicker to be promoted
bad,I'm personally not interested in answering or providing any information at this time regarding my current employer.  I have been with this company for almost 12 years and I think it is time to move on.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Although I wasn't with this company very long, I can say for the short time period that I was there, it was a great learning experience and gave me a start when it came to work."
bad,Unethical
bad,"I feel the company would be great if they managed the departments better. There are constant lay off's, and low wages. I feel that we could definitely be better compensated for the work we do in addition to having a better work life balance."
bad,Everyone is aware of the issues Wells Fargo has had. I hope they learned a lesson and that working for them now is a much different experience! I was never given a raise.
bad,"After working at Wells Fargo for almost 4 years, I have met very few people who actually believe what Wells Fargo is saying about anything. We have had quite a few scandals lately which makes it harder on the employees, yet we see minimal pay increases. They make you change jobs to get anything better than a 1.5-2% pay increase which leads to a lot of turnover and very few people who truly know what they are doing within an area."
bad,Every job that i have had has added to my skills to succeed. First Union/Wells Fargo started out as Administrative Assistant position and was reorganized to call center.  I chose to leave this environment to find something better.
bad,It was ok i was part time and worked per diem. I had to work saturdays . it was a bad company to work for. If i was full time it would have been better option for me
bad,I want somewhere I can grow and not have to wait for opportunities more than a year before approval . It’s a great company but I would love a much more challenge and better teamwork.
bad,The company has little regard for employees. Their main focus is their customers so they say but they don't treat them very well either. Too many chiefs not enough Indians in a atmosphere that is driven by customer service and attaining production numbers. I had more compliance meetings than personal development meetings in the 1.5 years of being employed.
bad,The micro management is over the top. micro management was over the top. Micro management was over the top. they question everything you do if it wasnt on your schedule. being a female I dont appreciate being asked why I'm in the bathroom or being told it can wait for my break.
bad,A typical day at work can vary depending on your staffing. I have found that a lot of branches do not have adequate staffing. Some branches are great while others can ruin the company for you. Hit or miss.
bad,"You were constantly hassled to meet crazy sales goals that were not always in the customers best interest. You would be required to stay late or come in early to practice ""selling a product"" to customers and talking them into things they may not need."
bad,"Not much of a dress code."
bad,"Stressful cutthroat environment. Managers pushed people to do illegal things. Ridiculous sales goals, excessive technicalities that prevent tellers and bankers from reaching goals"
bad,"Led teller team from 7th in the district to 1st in the district"
bad,Most of Management would often choose to be more concerned with maintaining hierarchy and political pecking order than with process improvement or serving the customer.
bad,can be a good place to work butconstant changes.To much presure to push things you don want to do .Best part customer service and working withe public
bad,no thank you I don't have time to give a full review of wells fargo and the their business actions in Great Falls Montana. This part is just a pain to do for you.
bad,This is a very stressful company to work for. The expectations are to much with the pay that you are getting. Management needs to change their policies  regarding helping customers.
bad,"In training they train you on how to navigate through the screens we were working on. When we get to the team floor it was all about sales, which is not explained."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"●	Responsible for handling incoming calls regarding student loans"
bad,I wish not to make a statement on the company. A typical day had a variety of different task. No two days were the same. Management was normal as most companies.
bad,"I was brought in to do work which did not appear, despite assurances that it was coming, finally contract was ended due to there not being enough work to justify keeping me there."
bad,The management is not accurate as should be. The policies and procedures are not mad for employees. They are mainly for management not employee tolerant.
bad,I liked working at the bank because I liked working with money. I've wanted to work at a bank since I was a little kid. The only thing that sucked was the requirement to make sales; that definitely make the job too stressful and not fun.
bad,The job was easy. Filing and sorting files along with qc files and pulling release was the easiest job anyone can do. Simple task and standing in your feet all day.
bad,"I do not have much to say about the company other than answering the previous questions. It was an unfair, stressful underpaying job with lack of management at the time and I try to steer away from complaining but I was very stressed there."
bad,Very difficult to move up in the company. Management go by favoritism. No help to move up within the company. HR never assists when there is an issue they refer you to management instead. Too much risk and pressure for low pay.
bad,"Employees always felt expendable."
bad,"A typical day was being tied to your phone staring at dual computer monitors. What I learned is middle management is a joke that is out of touch with reality. It's wasn't the honest employees that screwed up the WF name and image but we sure had to pay the price for it in absolutely everything we did and said. Workplace culture is really what's been coming out about the company over the past year and a half. Tell customers/employees one thing and do something else instead. Only those that ""buy"" completely into the culture have any chance of moving up in the company. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the lofty goals set and inconsistency in ""grading"". Most enjoyable part of the job was when you could actually help someone or explain something in terms they understood."
bad,Most customers have no idea they owed money. It was really shady in my opinion. They don't like you talking to co-workers even when you are not taking calls
bad,I worked at Wells Fargo for 7 years. I learnt so much when it came to sales. But the environment is not a healthy place to advance.  The benefits were great. The pay was decent. But the management team were not as supportive as needed to be.
bad,"stressful in retail with management. I do not know about other departments within Wells Fargo. I heard great things about others in different departments, but retail is extremely different."
bad,they never called back. they did not find me work once the assignment had ended. I would call and they would not call back. I had to find another temp service to find me work.
bad,Wellsfargo is a good place to work. I'm  a temp so I cant say for sure how they treat their employees. what can I say. thank you for hiring me. thank you
bad,Time is short with customers or we get in trouble if over time they don’t get that customers have questions Wells Fargo work different and to me I was not customer service like
bad,"Long days, no chairs. Thirty minute lunches. No overtime. Saturdays required. Split days off. Company under Congressional hearing review and sanctions. Poor reputation."
bad,I really do not remember the work environment at Wells Fargo because this was such a long time ago and the management and staff are no longer employed there.
bad,In a call center environment it is very faced paced and results driven.  This was a rewarding environment when we were able to assist callers but the upper management lacked experience
bad,I personally will never go back but it's great to get your foot in the door. I started their straight out of high school and I been there ever since. The pay could be better but it's not a lot.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,After mortgage industry collapse. Wells Fargo's underwriting policies and procedures were stressful and difficult. The length of time it took to underwrite a loan was cumbersome and required many steps to support your loan decision.
bad,"not for me. took it as a college student to help pay bills, but they required overtime, which conflicted with my school schedule. They don't tell you anything if you say no, but they openly say how its a team effort. I worked in a vault."
bad,"The high pressure sales culture that existed at Wells Fargo was the reason I chose to leave. It was after I resigned (under threat of firing for not meeting sales goals, despite having near perfect customer service and quality assurance metrics) that the scandal about the sales culture broke, and from what I understand, the sales goals have been eliminated."
bad,"do not expect to be rewarded for good job and advancement. its good place if you do not have much expectation. The co-workers are good. ...,..........."
bad,Benefits are great overall. The culture is very poor and intense. Management lacks knowledge and contributes to poor morale of the employees. Low level managers do not support the programs that the company offers.
bad,"no recommended to work there.  it is not good. the worse company to work for.  it is suck.  I did not like it..a lot of luck of management"
bad,"This is the most aggressive sales organization I have ever work for.  That being said, it taught me a lot about sales & organization.  Never go in as a low-level position."
bad,"customer service , data entry , sales to customer to open new accounts was a must , needed to reach a goal per day or risk being terminated.. personal was great and friendly"
bad,Working for Wells Fargo call center was my least favorite job. Performance was based on how much money and business you could bring the bank and not customer satisfaction. The systems have changed due to the lawsuits as a result of sales requirements and fraudulent accounts. May be better.
bad,There is a large disconnect between the culture WF shows to the world and the culture we experience as employees. People are no longer WF competitive advantage.
bad,Ok company to work for.  Decent pay and benefits. Nothing extraordinary.  Worked as a teller all the way up to a branch manager.  I also worked as a business banker.
bad,"Stressful place to work.  Outstanding professional development training.  Workplace culture is extremely competitive and sales are pushed to meet sales quotas.  Customers' money is what is important not the customer.  The hardest part of the job is assisting customers with honest financial advise since sales quotas must be met.  Opening fraudulent credit and deposit accounts are monitored to increase sales and customer retention.  The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers, modeling the way toward ethical sales practices and professional banking services to the staff and helping and listening to our customers to match them to prodcuts for their financial success."
bad,Wachovia bought out AG Edwards and Sons mid 2007 while the financial crisis was beginning. Wachovia was a victim of the economy and was almost immediately bought out by Wells Fargo.
bad,The mortgage loan servicing department had an extremely high turnover with lots of employee stress.  The training there was very poor.  Employees were often quitting.
bad,Under paid for the work load required. Pay structure is geared towards upper management and not filtered down to the employees that work directly with the customers. Multiple times promises from upper management were made to employees that never happened. Very high turn over in 2 years my whole office had a new staff... literally!
bad,"Very long hours. Management very incomprehensible  and demanding "
bad,the load and emphasis on sales places on employees was very unrealistic.  All employees would get to a point of desperation and find ways to budge sells.  We did not provide customer service but were forced to find ways to place our customers in debt.
bad,Processed medical claims and quoted medical benefits for providers. Fast paced work environment switched you to different areas without training properly.
bad,"I've been an employee of Wells Fargo for over a year. They really tell you early on that there is a ton of room for growth and advancement, which is quickly gone once you actually start. While the pay is decent, it could be more considering they are a huge corporation and the cost of living in my area is extremely high. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"It was a stressful and unorganized, management was un trustworthy. One thing I learned is that not everywhere you work is gonna be helpful and sometimes being independent is the best way in most cases."
bad,"they job was hard to advance within the company.  they only at time promoted people that the knew but not for people that has the education, skills, and years of experience."
bad,"The jump into January and Small Business campaigns were filled with unethical nonsense.  Constantly beat up for poor accounts, with zero value on relationship building. Finally in September 2016 the truth came out."
bad,Enjoyed working at Wells Fargo.The only issues i would have was the management. Its like the would promote anyone as a manager just because the were desperate and short staffed.
bad,"We are here to do job for wellsfargo we don't get same benefits has regular employees. "
bad,Very political place to work. I think the culture was cut throat and you had to compete both internally and externally. Alway changing stuff and miss managed and lacks ethics.
bad,"management was never there for you, unless they had an issue with you. My territory that I built to be very successful was cut up an givin to new hires."
bad,Typical work day is sometimes stressful since there are not enough employees to handle all the transactions coming through the doors. Upper management seems to not have any respect for their employees or regard for personal life challenges. i.e..illness and  Death of a parent.
bad,Awful hours. Days off were separated. Management usually not available. Seemed to often give wrong information not to familiar with the job. That was very frustrating.
bad,Working there I learned a lot about banking and sales. I enjoyed the customer service aspect of the job. I advanced quickly. It was very fast paced which I loved.
bad,A typical day of work was decent.  You had a set scheduled and the goals that you were to obtain to meet your criteria for potential raises.  I learned how business changes quickly in a bank environment and how you need to be adaptable.  The hardest part of the job was working without much variety in the type of work.  The most enjoyable part was the paid time off and the work to home life balance.
bad,"Management was cut throat, uneducated ... The coworker was good to work with relaxeda typical hours was cool change in management, overtime was when company needed"
bad,Wells Fargo had just taken over Wachovia and already their sales practices were making people uneasy. Before Wells took over Wachovia was a great place to work but Wells turned it into a high pressure sales gimmick.
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"The different systems and how everyone handles themselves within a bank."
bad,Was forced to sell as a teller. Would be written up if sales was not met. Was forced to see products that did not suit the customer. Like direct deposit of the elderly.
bad,"The benefits were good working here, but the position I focused too much on sales goals.  The people I worked with were great, but the constant pressure by management to achieve goals did not create a good work/personal balance."
bad,ok job to have it all is very dependent on your management and team you work with that will make you stick it out but lots of white lies and corporate games played to string you along and use you for all you got.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Bad management with little training. High expectations with little reward. The people are great but management is not great. It's not a very fun place to work.
bad,"This is a great company for entry-level college grads to get work experience, but the longer you work here, the more you realize how poorly you are being paid and how little your peers measure up to you. Pad your resume with time at Wells, get the experiences you can from it, and then move on to a better company. That seems to be what the worthwhile employees here do."
bad,"Pros"
bad,Good company to work for! A lot of great benefits and people. Politics is a present issue at this establishment. Cuthroat sales pressure. Depending on your position; work life balance is terrible.
bad,"I did not like working at wells fargo, many times i was told to push products on my customers that were irresponsible and could do more damage than good. It is a standard desk job with a push for sales."
bad,"DOL has injected unnecessary processes causing low income, good for clients not good for employees. Has issues with processes causing conflict of interest. Management is trying to fix the issues but I think they have lost control of the processes and some employees. Good systems, but challenging to learn."
bad,"poor management- micro management, but great team to work with. great company to work for other then working for my manager. great benefits, -overall great culture"
bad,"wells fargo is not a bad company to work for, the pay rate is very low its is no overtime and you cannot move up in the company.i would not go back to wells fargo.."
bad,Unreasonable production goals made it impossible to have quality audits.  New department manager who was new to the company did not try to relate to his staff.
bad,Management is out to make themselves look good and will not hesitate to feed yo to the lions. You can and more than likely will be thrown under the bus at some point. Very inexperienced and child like.
bad,The management was poor and the job training I received for the temporary position I worked at for a year was the worst I have ever experienced.  No one was happy there that I could see.
bad,I liked working for wells Fargo but my manager maid it impossible to enjoy and he was such a Jerk that I would never go back and work for him again ever.  But I would work for wells fargo.
bad,Very competitive bank. They push there employees to much about getting referrals. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet different people.
bad,The pay and benefits were great. many of us were on anti depressants due to the culture. We were encouraged to pressure customers to sign up for products. We were simultaneously told only to refer products customers could use and berated when we did not make a referral of a credit product.
bad,"the company didn't care about the employees. they tried to get people out before they made too much money, They did always pay you right. they closed here"
bad,Staff was always stressed about their sales goals. Banking is more geared towards sales and not enough about customer service. Poor management played a key role in the overall atmosphere.
bad,"I am currently working for this company and choose to not give an option. I choose not to give my opinion. Refuse to give an opinion. Have opinion and refuse to comment on my views of Well Fargo,"
bad,"Liked the job itself, love talking to and meeting people."
bad,"Wells Fargo is a great company. However, this was not my best job for personal reasons. Looking to have a career in banking environment, go for it. Call Center was not my strong suit when it came to banking. Customer will continuously blame everything on you. The management was descent but not the best. They were on your back to offer products to customer even if they did not need it."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,World Savings was bought out by Wachovia and I was laid off a couple of months later. Never really got to work under their management style. Wachovia did not seem friendly.
bad,"Nice manager, fun co-workers, horrible work environment. Closed late on a lot of loans, no one seemed to care. Had upper management say one time ""Oh well, there are other customers"""
bad,"BB&T was a great place to learn about banking. What to do and what not to do when it comes to your financial life. i had great supervisors."
bad,Very fast-paced and stressful work environment. In my area there is not much room for advancement but if it was one of the larger sites there is lots of opportunity with the company. I feel my wage was fair for the work I did.
bad,I was not happy with the way they push employees to get accounts or cc I believe banks should give client what they need not what they want them to have
bad,Can be a great position depending on who you're working for. The benefits are excellent but management can be a nightmare. I was working over 10 years. I left the company.
bad,"A lot of cold-calling; if you are great at customer service and selling the product/service you are assigned you'll be great at this job. If you aren't as comfortable with that, this may not be the job for you. Commissions are great as long as you can make some sales; co-workers are great as well."
bad,The company itself is a good company to work for...but not in retail banking... The district managers will push you very hard to get those solutions no matter what..
bad,"Wells Fargo was a good company to work for, but management staff was not the best, a lot of favoritisim, and when you did your job, and performed, management was not supportive.  Too many Clicks, you don't really stand a chance if you are a worker, you stand a better chance of succeeding if you are a social butterfly"
bad,"Although I have been employed here for a very long time and have had many good memories, I would rather not review the company where I am currently employed at."
bad,Massive hiring and layoffs; no happy medium.  WF micro-manages their employees and does not want negative customer service surveys. WF negativity is from the Office of the CEO and his underlings for unethical branch sale tactics (opening customer accounts without their authorization and other unethical practices).
bad,Poor management. Job was very basic. Hardest part of the job was dealing with management. Nobody had a seemed to care and take pride I their work. The most enjoyable part of the job was the dress code
bad,The everyday work environment is ok. The work culture is more on the side of WF making money. If you are in a department where the company doesn't make money then there is a unorganized structure due to WF doesn't care.
bad,Expected to work 12 or more hour days. poor Management support. high stress work environment. high pressure sales. Micro Managed. very poor job stability.
bad,"Started there as a temp.  in training program.  Was very uncomftable they way employees and staff were toward me.  Not very friendly, no eye contact and people kept their distance from me.  I did 3 weeks of training and I did not complete.  Felt Wells Fargo was not the place I wanted to work for."
bad,"unrealistic Sales Goals for all retail employees in all levels of company corporation from teller to CEO, as the media and population know the practices of Wells."
bad,"gathering short sale documentation from various Agents/Brokers. After gathering documentation further job functions include setting up the file, making sure all required parties signed the documents and prepare them for negotiator review, postponing foreclosure sale dates, ordering appraisals and making sure the agent/broker is in compliance with the short sale investor."
bad,"There was often great flexibility in start time, work hours, etc. The team members are excellent and make good co-workers. However, if a problem should arise, the ability to speak in confidence regarding management concerns or work environment can cost your job. The availability for long-term contracts (or to-hire positions) is very limited."
bad,"When working with folks money you get the best of people. When I worked for Wells Fargo they had HUGE sales goals that forced their employees to lie, cheat, and steal from people to get to those goals and if you didn't you were punished... I have a high level of integritiy i like to think, and it was VERY difficult to move up and once I did I had to leave as fast as possible before i was fired for not meeting  unachievable weekly and daily goals."
bad,It's who you know and how you can play managers to favor you. Being effective and exceed performance is not enough. They do not value higher education degrees. Mediocre pay.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"I learned about the finalcial area, I like the direct contact with customer and provide a good services."
bad,"very sales driven, more about sales then about peoples finances; be prepared to sell 4-5 products a day to meet sales goal for sales manager. not just about taking deposits"
bad,"Over 10 years the company changed from being customer focused and possibly the best Banking organization in the USA, to selling widgets for profit.  All executive efforts were on sales, not what the customer needs.  All focus was on activities that would propel quota achievements."
bad,No real room for advancement.  Mundane in my particular position during that time.I wanted to advance into management within another position but was told that I needed to stay within my department
bad,The sales goals required to keep your position are incredibly high. A lot of negative pressure applied to the staff to achieve goals in less then ideal means.
bad,"Morale is low due to the recent public scandals and the suing of the company .  "
bad,"Wells Fargo did not offer a supportive atmosphere from Management.  There was slim opportunity for advancement.  They were very strict with their policies for time off and made no exceptions, especially under emergency situations."
bad,"I worked at Wells Fargo several years ago and hopefully things have changed. When I worked there the pay was low. The demand for cross sales was way to high to achieve, and staff was told they would be fired if not reached. The branch that I worked at was very unfriendly to new staff and would not speak to new people. The training was terrible."
bad,Assist and maintain strong relationships while advising customers in financial decisions and options. Make outbound calls to customers to set up appointments to discuss the products and services that Wells Fargo offered that customers could utilize in their personal and business needs.
bad,Very sales driven. Stressful place to work. Lots of sales pressure. If you don't hit your goals with get in trouble very easily. Colleagues were nice.
bad,"Micromanagement seems to be embedded into Wells Fargo's organizational structure. If you enjoy being harassed by managers on a daily basis, or if you are simply looking for a major organization that doesn't care about its customers or people in general, Wells Fargo is an excellent option. Don't let the pay fool you, this job will occupy every facet of your life."
bad,"Wells Fargo does not grow their employees. Minorities are left behind on the growth curve. They want to keep them in operational roles, with less pay, and growth opportunity."
bad,This  was like working in a call center and management not very knowledgeable of loan  products.  Eventually our department was laid off and had to look for  other employment.
bad,"Entry level job"
bad,Strict sales goals during the time I was employed.  They were constantly breathing down your neck to open accounts and even asked to bring in family for accounts
bad,Work was to first listen to soon quickly explain the job and you were suppose to learn it in 1 day. Learned nothing. Management was never there- never saw the person. Culture - weird like it is in Portland. Hardest part of the job - understanding why I was there. Most enjoyable: did sit with wire transfer team in customer service and they were so knowledgeable in their job they really were a joy to learn from in a few days.
bad,The work life balance is non existent as I would be on the road and or working 7 days a week.  Less of a problem when you're hourly... Big deal when you go from hourly to salary with no raise in the base.
bad,"It was a great way to learn new things in a company as far as life situations, like Bankruptcy and Foreclosure. There is too many changes and not enough work in perfecting the product or guidelines before turning it over to the floor."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Very fast paced environment. Learned a lot of time management and communication skills while working here. A typical day would be arriving to work, getting logged on, and taking calls to service customers accounts while remaining professional and following regulations. The employees are great and super friendly."
bad,Micro Managing and No Help with career advancement without long years of service with little forward movement.  results and bottom line driven to an insane degree.
bad,Too much work for not enough pay. That pretty much summarizes everything about Wells Fargo and their jobs... If you enjoy Sales great but dont force customers into products that they may not need. Refer just on a need basis. Favorite got to Online account....it's free
bad,"Business Development/Project Management Skills were used; administrative including powerpoint primary."
bad,"Working here is repetitive, benefits are decent, atmosphere is reflective on how Wells likes to viewed as diverse.  People are great management is so so. There is  a lot of internal competition, this comes from WELLS used to promote sales ect.  You are (ranked) review daily by means of report and statics.   As far as growth you are told that you can move up after a year, but you see a lot of employees who have not moved up, you are told you should master your current position before you advance.  a typical day at work is sitting and answering customer calls all day, with 15 minutes of break every two hours, management only come around when they want to coach you to improves sales or reports, co worker again are the best part, the hardest part is the constant reports that tell you where your are ranked daily, this is stressful,the people who love working here are the people who are not on the phones.  Wells want to to do a lot of bootie kissing..."
bad,Expected to take on too many projects/tasks which make the job very difficult.  Not enough documentation or support for various job functions which leads to high inefficiencies and sometimes inconsistent results.
bad,Initially I was excited to work for such a big company and was happy to be hired. However after only a little bit of time it was apparent that I would remain in my hired position forever if I didn't leave. The requirement to makes sales was challenging and poor performance could result in an employees termination. This also with difficult customer service experiences on a daily basis made work life unhappy to say the least.
bad,It's a good company to work for good pay issues with management and communication. Communication between team members and management is poor.
bad,"Allowed me to work there for almost 3 years. When I received a job offer to work in a different department with better pay and more responsibility, my department terminated my employment without the option for rehire only minutes after I put in my two weeks notice. This was done 5 days before Christmas. A completely heartless operation with only a profit motive as a goal. No regard for the well-being of their staff. I felt as dispensable as a faulty printer. Enjoyed my team members and immediate manager and team lead. Upper level management has lost sight of what it means to be considerate to one another and to treat people with dignity."
bad,"Between management, changing priorities, and removal of incentive payments and restrictions on overtime - Wells Fargo used to be a decent place to work but the culture has totally changed in the past 6 months or so.  I would not recommend someone applying for a position with this company."
bad,Typical day was busy all day long. Learned a lot of customer service . Management is always around. Co-workers are the team players. Hardest part of the job was getting customer to be happy. enjoyable part was getting off work.
bad,"A typical day at work managed foreign exchange accounts consisted of several international and domestic currencies. Performed daily bank statements reconciliation. Researched, analyzed, reviewed and identified unapplied transactions. Performed OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) scanned identified transactions for possibility of Anti-money laundry. Notified Front Office if they were expecting funds for customers. Once Front Office confirmed funds were expected a contracts were booked for confirmation. Contacted customer and confirmed booked contract. Processed funds to customers account by wiring or debiting/crediting customer’s accounts. If unapplied funds are OFAC hit followed the protocol procedure of Compliance office's advise: either by requested for more details from sender correspondent bank or confiscated funds and filed a SAR report. Moved funds to a suspense account and reported status to compliance department. Reviewed and performed a reasonable business risk assessment and reported to compliance team"
bad,"Challenging job, lots of support to help develop career. Work place balance can be tough. No more sales goal, more focus on customer"
bad,"The management was not good and they constantly hired temps instead of full time employees.  I learned a lot about mortgage there but it was a very high stress environment.  Teams got moved around a lot and I ended up in a position that I didn't want to be in,"
bad,"Most days as a collector consisted of the 12--9 grind on the phones, calls coming in on average 1 per 1-2 minutes. I learned a lot about managing company software and phone calls simultaneously to address customer concerns and collect on over due accounts. My co-workers were the highlight of the job, the actual community itself was pleasant to work in. The hardest part of the job was probably the monotony of the call structure and sheer volume of calls handled, it definitely required a shift in approach and even lifestyle for me to adapt to such a quick paced environment."
bad,"Management is short-sighted and treats lower level/frontline employees (aka ""Team Members"") very poorly.  The current scandal of 2016 is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of bad management and company culture."
bad,"Would not recommend ANYONE works here.  Co-Workers are always on edge because you never know when, or who, is going to be fired wrongfully next."
bad,Wells Fargo provides their employees with a lot of benefits and a decent work place. The staff is friendly and helpful. The companies business practices as a whole make me question my desire to work there.
bad,"What I learned from my time with Wells Fargo is that it really depends on those who you work with, it is important that you have a manager that cares not only how the store is doing but also how you are doing as an individual"
bad,I work as a customer service rep. for this company and I just want to say co-workers are awesome but management is NOT professional and helpful. Pay is good compared to other companies. For the first time I can say this is the worst job I ever had no matter how much they could pay me.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,You receive a pipeline of your own to try and complete daily as well as take inbound customer service calls ever 2 to 3 minutes. My position was not labeled as a customer service representative. There are so many responsibilities daily to perform and you have to be on the phone the entire time. You are not allowed to be off the phone to do any of your actual work. I can say I had a great manager who tried his best to ease the frustrations because he knew how stressful and ridiculous it was. There is no same requirement for underwriters either and that was ridiculous.
bad,When wells fargo took over it all went down hill from there.  its all about sales and away with service it all went... it was disappointing work
bad,the pressure is on ounce you start working for them they pressure for you to make a certain amount of sales and if not met you get ridden up if not met.
bad,"Stressfull and you  can get fired for the simplest reason even though sometimes it's a simple mistake with no warning or writing you up,,, a lot of people got fired and it was so unfair."
bad,I worked as a sales banker in the the phone bank. A typical day involved answering the phone and selling customers as many products as possible. The more experienced and successful bankers like myself trained new employees. The bank really cared nothing for it's employees or customers. They only wanted to make as much money as possible. There was really no room for advancement.
bad,"A typical day primarily included to service and offer products to the clients, to help them succeed financially. In the office, the co-workers that I have had an opportunity to meet, for the most part, I absolutely loved and enjoyed being around them, it's probably the most enjoyable part of the job. The most difficult part of the job is having to be extremely resourceful in an consistently changing environment and having limited person to person guided help. The management can be somewhat distant and undeserving, and those who are chosen to represent management, are completely the same."
bad,Answered incoming and made outgoing calls on a daily basis to collect mortgages or assist customers. Learned to multitask and adapt on a constant daily basis.
bad,"not so great, just another big bank that wants to squeeze the life out of you for there own gain so the big ceo can fly around in there jets while we are just making them richer and richer."
bad,"Total disregard for the needs of employees and recruits.  make specific to recruits and reverse course upon signing of contract, blaming changes upon home office directives.  All in all, one of the worse experiences I have had in the job market."
bad,"Do transactions for customers, complete assigned tasks, and trying to get customers to add products to their accounts or open non existing accounts.  The hardest part of the job was being able to exceed your required thresholds in order to potentially make more than your base hourly wage.  The best part of the job were building relationships with co-workers and customers."
bad,worked overtime and did not get compensated for it. over worked and under paid. Bad upper management. Product pusher mentality no respect for the customers.
bad,Working for wells fargo had great benefits and good money but a terrible work life balance. It's not a great place to work for and the job culture is not good.
bad,"Would not recommend company in the form while I was there."
bad,"Not a very good place to work. Very little pay and there was no room for advancement as a teller. However, the training for this position is good."
bad,"The sales expectations of the company is over the top super pushy, "
bad,Each day involves running in circles trying to work within the Wells Fargo system which is impossible with the staffing that they employ. Management tried to care but they also had to work within the limits of the company environment. My co-workers are the one thing that I miss after leaving. They were all trying to stay afloat as well and making the best of every day for each other. The hardest part of the job was trying to help my customers when they are considered last in importance. They people were definitely the most enjoyable part of the job.
bad,They focus on too much selling and not much customer service. They put a lot of pressure on phone bankers. Not to mention WF has some of the rudest customers that will curse you out and there is nothing in place to help you when that arises.
bad,"If you don't get in good with your manager, it's not likely you will see much growth with that company."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Canvass for businesses to open  checking and saving accounts, lines/loans, merchant services, payroll, and insurance products. I learn that as an employee at Wells Fargo is not truly valued and underappreciated. Management could be a lot better if they were treated better. Co-workers was a good diversity. The hardest part of the job too many managers giving too many different goals. Building a long term relationship with business clients, and with co-workers."
bad,The Branch managers are all pushed to meet extremely high quotas so they push the whole team to sale more accounts and most of the times you pretty much have to slam customers to hit numbers
bad,"-Typical day consisted of signing in and dialing down what we called a queue, accounts that were assigned to us to call to collection payments and arrangements payments."
bad,"Wells Fargo offers great benefits such as 401k/comapny matching, health care, and paid vacation. However, when it comes to advancement, either you know someone that will help you get ahead or you do not. Most management I dealt with during my time at Wells Fargo is unorganized and does not define true leadership skills."
bad,"Business management and technical management were on different pages.  Did not share the same devlierables and timeline,"
bad,"Need to work on diversity, which they pride themselves in, but do not be fooled.  The treatment of Contractors is HORRIBLE, unfair, and they use them and spit them out for dinner.  The building is empty, since the FTE work from home most of the time.  The management is constantly taking time off and working from home.  Definitely NOT an inclusive workplace.  Contractors are not included on most functions, meetings, volunteer time, etc."
bad,"great company to promote within, they will always have new positions to help you grow, but its very sales driven and numbers not people oriented"
bad,Management very strong on sales and meeting quarterly sales goals. No opportunities to move up. Customers very friendly.
bad,"it was ghetto and not really that professional but it did give me the experience I needed to go to another call center and learn new things, great feet in the door position, I kind of just made the best out of the situation until I found a better fit for me"
bad,It's who you know not what you know in this environment!! I personally would not recommend anyone to work here. Business as usual!!
bad,I found Wells Fargo to be my least favorite job/company I've ever done/worked for.  The branch environment was negative and sales were pushed down the clients throats.  I only worked there for one year.
bad,I already did a review for the wells fargo operations center and now this website is making me do it again. I wont work at the wellsfargo operations center anytime soon.
bad,"Well, I might be biased because my bank was getting bought out by them, but they were difficult to deal with. I was written up for not going to work because of a hurricane and the city officials warned us to stay in our homes. I was told to get a boat and row myself to work."
bad,"If you want to be put under tremendous pressure to produce unreasonable results that are not at all based upon what is good for the customer, while working under management that got their jobs by being deft politicians but not necessarily skilled or of good character, this is the place for you."
bad,It is very hard to grow within the company. Once you are in a certain department it is very difficult to advance and move into different departments.
bad,numbers driven environment and can feel like slavery. The benefits are above average and the colleagues usually are what makes the environment bearable.
bad,"A typical day at work is very slow, sometimes the days are so slow we are sent home early. I was not getting my full hours in."
bad,"Call center Atmosphere. Can make easy friends and not so friendly ones...Watch the show ""The Office"" its like that. Make sure to be highly confident about yourself and any relationship you might be in, can be a real eye-opener for people. Must be able to MULTI-TASK."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,The company sales goals can be unrealistic based on location and advancement opportunities are hard to obtain unless you know the right people. Almost seems hard work and great customer service doesn't matter anymore. Very sad company to work for these days.
bad,"Large company that is big on employee engagement. The company encourages working with team member engagement groups to facilitate diversity and inclusion and personal and professional growth. Laid back environment where hardly anyone gets fired; you have to do something really stupid to get fired. It is not uncommon to work with someone who has been with the company for 30 years."
bad,"I operate a conflex machine for Wells Fargo, I learned on my own how to operate, troubleshoot, as well as mechanically fix the machine. Management is horrible. Half of my co-workers actually work. The hardest part of my job is having to do pretty much everything. The most enjoyable part of my job is leaving to go home."
bad,wells fargo is more about the company than they are the customers and they lend more for the customers than I would agree that they are a good bank to bank with
bad,"Opportunity to learn many aspects of the financial world, but you are expected to carry many responsibilities and cover where coverage is not being provided (i.e. branch manager or teller isn't working--you are expected to pick up the slack) to avoid you being reprimanded for their lacking performance."
bad,"A typical day at work consist of taking customers calls and maintenanceing customers accounts under the pressure of strict sales goals, micro managing, and high tension."
bad,Pretty standard IT position in a banking evironment. Low times and high times of putting our fires and working through projects.
bad,"In a digital world, the best way to submit mortgage applications was by preparing huge paper packages and shipping to underwriters. At the time of my departure they were making the switch but to late if you ask me."
bad,"Cool summer job, for college and high school kids. Great for an athlete to work there, especially for equipment and apparel discounts."
bad,"pull daily reports, send for approval on agents for day one tranfser request. submit report for acconts already approved. take assets off book on assets delivered. call on assets that failed. request account numbers from counter broker. send manual transfer request to fund company. call transfer agent for assets with manual transfer request sent on previous day. take asset off books on confirmed transfers. respond to inquires."
bad,"Unprofessional management, the more work you put forward the higher the expectation. Co-workers were all about themselves not many team players. Environment was very hostile toward low producing employees."
bad,I felt that the employees were their only to get experience to go someplace else.  Most workers  seamed depressed and unsatisfied with their jobs.
bad,extreme sales pressure in a slow branch... not about helping customers.. just making quotas. I dont feel like my job  is to help people succeed financially but attach every single thing i can
bad,"The work day was very long, worked 9-11 hours daily without breaks or lunch, and no off days. Very large turn over team members would only last 6-9 months. This bank is about sales, sales, sales not about the customers or employees."
bad,"I found that customer service was not the focus of this position which is what I was looking for.  It was difficult to get any time off even though your benefits included 18 days off per calendar year."
bad,Not enough recognition. Negative reinforcement. management not supportive enough. Best part of work was my co workers.
bad,"helped customers with there accounts"
bad,A typical work day was stressful. I did not experience work life balance. Co -workers were self contained and not trustworthy.
bad,"WF culture is one of a customer centric value, however this is not what is portrayed by direct management. Extreme sales pressure that does not resonate well with retail employees of all levels. It does not translate into a happy work environment."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Wells Fargo would be a great place to work if work/life balance was as important to leaders as it is to employees. The company does offer great benefits even to part time employees which is a great plus. There are opportunities for advancement but there is also a lot micromanaging involved.
bad,Have kids in management that have no idea how to lead but are very good at wearing short skirts and sitting on male co-workers desk.
bad,"Leaving my role as Store Manager was bitter sweet for me. I loved my team and providing them support to develop and grow, however the leadership I was provided to not do the same for me. "
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of being at my desk answering phones non-stop. Not only was every moment of my day monitored but I was ""talked to"" about unscheduled breaks. Excuse me if I have to go to the bathroom in between scheduled breaks.My peers were great but management was dissapointing. There are very high expectations placed on employees but the necessary tools needed to be successful were not provided. The hardest part of the job was having to hear everyday about the areas where I was lacking but not receiving assistance/advice on how to be successful in those areas is frustrating.  I learned that I am not able to ask supervisors for help and I am pretty much on my own to ""figure it out"". The training that was provided was extensive but irrelevant, which proved to be unhelpful while on the job. Nobody is on the same page, there is so much miscommunication. Once person says ""do it this way"" the next says ""no you're doing it wrong"". Frustrating!"
bad,I work for Wells Fargo over 7 years and I look back and wonder why was I still working here. Favoritism is at the highest with this employer and majorities do not have the opportunity to advance.
bad,Working in the retail environment for the bank is daunting.  You are more of a number rather than a person.  Make sure you hit your daily goals or there will be punishment.
bad,"I have never been presented with a job that I could not do and that I could not do well. I am an extremely reliable person and if anybody ever calls in I am the first person they call to cover the shift. If they were ever too busy they knew they could always ask for me to stay late. My responsibilities were ordering and shipping money, making the weekly schedules, opening and closing the store, coming up with and executing store competitions to encourage selling."
bad,"A normal day at wells fargo I would show up and set up my station and just get right to helping my customers. My coworkers and management never really acknowledged anyone coming on shift. I learned alot about banking and fraud which I really enjoyed but when it came to needing help from a manager they were never around, they were not very involved and spent more time outside smoking cigarettes and socializing. But i did enjoy helping my customers."
bad,"I used to love to work for Wells Fargo.   Was very proud to say I worked there.   Over the past two years so much has changed.  They micro manage the people down the very minute they spend on every system and website the employee is on all day.  It is extremely stressful and many of the employees are now on medication to deal with the anxiety of the fear climate implemented.  If you do not meet impossible production standards set, you will be fired.   Employees with the company for more than a decade who in the past have been rewarded and praised for great work are now being weeded out the door.   And one percent raises over the  past three years do not meet the cost of raising insurance premiums.  It is sad that a once great environment has been broken down bit by bit an replaces with employment communism."
bad,If you love the thrill of conquering a daily sales quota this job is for you! If you are not really a sales person but you dont mind selling it may be for you. If you absolutely cannot stand sales DO NOT APPLY! The branch revolves around sales numbers. Everyone from the teller to the manager is focused on sales. Each manager can coach its team however they like which can be very tricky. It is not a customer service job it is a sales job!
bad,"Too much pressure, not healthy for those with anxiety. Prepare to be micromanaged to the point of insanity if you work for this company. The co-workers and management were decent people, but difficult to work with. The hours were always fantastic, along with the vacation time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the professionalism."
bad,This company does not focus on its employees.  They are mainly focused on sales.  We were made to sell sell sell.
bad,"I was hired as a Bank Teller. It was very low in hours and was super because you could receive health benefits for you and your family."
bad,I will never work in Wells Fargo again. Poor Management too much pressure on employees.
bad,"•Providing quality customer service to customers "
bad,"The company had a lot of benefit and rewards. Fortunately, I got lucky and I had a great team to work with. The bad side is that I had no intentions of staying."
bad,"Will the moral was low in the area I worked, Wells Fargo did treat their employees to some fun days and fun contests. The company as a whole is not very understanding of a work/life balance.  The salary is lower than the norm for the industry and the insurance plans are quite expensive"
bad,This was a good experience in the banking model for the delivery of investment products to retail clients.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Employees were terribly unprofessional and very rude.  I left because I was told to lie for my manager.  I refused, they took away my telephone.  One teller lost $1000 and he is still working there. unbelievable."
bad,"Negotiate export LC documents"
bad,"work environment was good, learned a lot banking stuff, it was my first time learning about all these papers I mean as a new comer to the states.. Wells Fargo was my first school here in the states."
bad,Too sales oriented. Pushing customers to products not needed. Management was terrible.
bad,Job did not pay well. Employees were friendly. Working downtown was nice. Job was ok but was not enjoyable.
bad,It was difficult selling products you didn't believe in. Knowing the products would put some customers even more into debt than get them out yet we had to sell it like it was the best thing for them. We were told that it is not up to us to decide what is best for them. I was blessed to have been laid-off.
bad,"Before your apply as a Phone Banker, be aware that you must be in your department for one year prior to looking at other jobs within the company. Now, exceptions CAN be made for the right people to advance them prior to these time in grade requirements, but only if you smooch the right behinds. "
bad,Not much to say. They teach you want you need to know but if you aren't selling you are wasting their time.
bad,a great place to work and learn about banking but right now I'm seeking for a place to work in the healthcare field
bad,"Not enough time to evaluate, worked there maybe 2 weeks.   Coworkers were ok."
bad,"Worse job ever. This is not a career for you to grow. Although Wells Fargo is probably one of the highest paying banks for personal bankers for their sales culture is ridiculous. Extremely unprofessional and unethical. You cannot make it in this job if you don't cheat or lie. Upper manager do not care about you, all they care is about numbers. How much credit card you sell, loan you book, checking accounts you open, how much you provide referrals for private bankers and merchant and payroll services. You occasionally work some Saturdays and they will cut your week day hours so they don't pay you over time."
bad,Low compensation programs that constantly change to benefit the bank.
bad,"Not a great environment. "
bad,"I have had experiences with wells fargo over the years, some were great."
bad,"A typical day at work would be arriving at the bank, doing a financial audit of my cash drawer and then helping customer's with their financial needs."
bad,"Not too good or bad.  First job out of college, not bad experience but would never go back"
bad,Their idea of customer service is to rush customers off the phone.  Calls must be completed in 272 seconds.  Sales were a fun part of the job.
bad,It was the same as PrimeLending except that  the loan process needed to be fixed so loan closing dates were not missed.  Here alot of the problems that needed addressed were caused by over Underwriting and I would have to find guidelines that matched my argument to get the loans closed.
bad,"Enjoyed working with the customers, but upper management can show tons of favoritism."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,My orientation to Wells Fargo was not positive. No one trained me on their systems or processes
bad,"Management are not the greatest of leaders, they are quick to critique your performance when you are down, but do not guide you or help you to become better. Good pay, but horrible atmosphere with terrible leadership."
bad,"i never like working there too much of class learning etc.. not good pay, not good manangements."
bad,"A typical day would include coming in at 8:30 and doing the night deposits. By the time night deposits are finished, it's 9:00 AM and the doors are open. I get along with all of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is trying to sale to the customers. We have regular customers and the company wants us to push everything on them. Also, we have to get so many cores per day and with me being part-time, it was very hard to do. They only hire part-time tellers which is kind of a downer for those who need more income. The most enjoyable part of this job for me was balancing at the end of my shift."
bad,"This was a great place for me to learn and have a small stable income.  I was a personal banker for a year at 30K/year.  I worked several locations but ended up in a bad neighborhood.  I spent most of my time discussing bank fees or helping people apply for loans they would never get."
bad,Wells Fargo is not a great company too work for. They care nothing at all about their employees. Its all about how much they get out of you at the end of the day. Your life will only be about sales and calls. The only pro to this job is a nice pay. The way they set up the bonuses is horrible.
bad,taught me to open new accounts and deal with another level of customer service
bad,Growth and advancement very limited. Company not stable and is now Wells Fargo
bad,The rewarding part is able to help thousands of home owners buy or refinance their homes. Sales is always challenging and very rewarding. Enjoy networking with people in the community.
bad,This position is extremely stressful and disorganized. Managers rely on micro managing. Involuntary turnover is high. This position works best for someone who is currently unemployed or recent college graduates with limited experience.
bad,"room for growth but stressful, some managers had no idea what they were doing. other managers bullied their employees and other managers promoted only their friends"
bad,"My work day consists of traveling where the client is located (primarily the Midwest area) and reviewing their financial records. One great aspect of this job is that one week I might audit a paper manufacturer and the next I am auditing a timber distributor. The knowledge base I get with this job is unbelievable. However, this job does not provide enough exposure to other departments and senior management. The hardest part of the job for me is the frequent travel."
bad,"➢Instrumental in the set up and office support system for a variety of organizations, including the fundraising foundation for a pediatric hospital, an advertising agency, financial institutions, an employee health benefits company and a University."
bad,"This position was through Thomas L Cardella & Associates. I would help others in a phone call of 5-6 min or less, to try and sell them identify theft protection. Its very repetitive work. I chose to find a better opportunity so I left that position."
bad,"no room for advancement"
bad,"Assisting customers, fast paced sales driven  environment,"
bad,"Bank brokerage segment is a conflict between priorities. Management is interested in numbers. the culture has changed since Wells took over. In al not a bad place, but be wary of management."
bad,Wells Fargo is so concentrated on Sales that a cut throat environment between fellow employees and unethical sales practices are prevailant in most every branch.  The upper level management micromanages middle management to an extreme point on a daily basis.  Work life balance is very low and employees often dread coming in to work.  Turn over is extremely high.
bad,It's a place to work but you have no other life outside of Wells Fargo
bad,I worked the second shift from 3pm to 12am. Typically I would come into a job que full of unfinished print jobs. Most of the time the client wanted their job completed before the end of business that day.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"High stress, micromanaged, no job security, no matter how successful you are at performance. very rewarding helping people,"
bad,Company's mindset is there is no important piece to the puzzle they dont care about employees or customers. Due to high turn around 80% opportunity to advance quick. High sales goals looooow compensation
bad,There was no room for advancement. Worked here while searching for better employement.
bad,"I came from working for Wachovia (which Wells Fargo bought out in 2008).  Wells Fargo cut benefits and pay in nearly half.  Nearly everyone that I worked with over 6 years was either let go during the merger process or was forced to leave due to corporate changes.  It was too bad.  I was excited for this change initially, but in the end, employees are just the little guy."
bad,"I had so many jobs within Wells as a employee. Wells was good at moving your current position when down sizing to another department. I learned the ins and out of Mortgage and how to problem solve and etc. Co-workers are workable. Hardest part of the job, it was two jobs in one and not enough proper training."
bad,management needs more training to assist employees and more stracture.
bad,A typical work day would be assisting customers with transactions and solving their banking issues. I learned the banks products and services as well as their processes. Management was under extreme pressure while being pulled in a million directions daily. They still had to ensure their team met their quotas for the month. The hardest part of the job was meeting quotas. The most enjoyable part was my coworkers.
bad,You are not a person but a number there. You are only a safe as your last sales result. One bad month and you are written up.
bad,"Management did not care about the customers and encouraged bankers to act unethically, constantly threatening their job security."
bad,As a previous Wachovia person the change was intense.  A great deal of great people left with the take over
bad,"Working at Wells Fargo had its highs and lows. The management was horrible, my supervisor was stealing, the president ignored everything.  Was not the best, however, I did learn a lot about banking and finances."
bad,"I believe that the companies are good organization to work for, but I wish there was more mentoring ships."
bad,Compensation and goals are not realistic to achieve.  They mess with your pay.
bad,"The sales goals are unattainable and therefore incentive unreachable.  I was expected to work 10 hours a day and two Saturdays a month.  This job consumed my entire life.  Good experience with a top notch manager, but would not work for them again."
bad,Too much Micro managing. Not much respect for the non-conforming arena.
bad,"Coming from Bank of America, I was familiar with Bank process and sales. To say the least Wells sales process I believe makes associates perform unethically."
bad,Is an Ok job with limits to progressing. A lot of employee turnovers and management changes were constantly made. A lot of customer complaints with long lines and management.
bad,I am very happy I started my banking career at Wells Fargo. They do an excellent job training in sales because of a very intense training program that extends well beyond the class room. They had a micro-managing philosophy in the group I worked with where I would often have 5 or 6 conversations with my manager on a given day. The position was very stressful for being a low level position. They demand a lot more of a person than is necessary.
bad,Productive work place; job security was not stable. The compensation was not fitting for job roles.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Ok not great or bad. Focus on sales only with little care for customer experience
bad,"fast pace till you burn out, really only sales matter, management is also burned out and stressed"
bad,"Lots of paperwork for loans."
bad,"Wells Fargo Advisors is the newest transition from Wachovia Securities, where they not only cared about you but your family as well.  Also this is certainly a con the co-workers certainly make it a bit easier to go to work.  This is the only job where I felt like all of us are a part of a family with the goods and the bad.  I have learned that although you may have the skill set to move forward that opportunity doesn't always present itself.  I learned that no matter the dedication provided to the company, that is all based on who you know."
bad,I was very temporary and I was a contractor. the training was ok but it could of been tailor better
bad,"I worked for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage in the foreclosure department for 10 suffering months. They have the company set up for ""structure"" however, you are treated like a child. If you are even 30 seconds late 8 x in a year without 24 hour notice you are fired. You have scheduled 15 min breaks that count for the late time as well; so you better not have to use the bathroom too long! They make you flip an andon to let them know what you are doing at all times! for example your andon will say either break, problem, working, training, etc... Also, if there are no loans to review then you have to do the learning center.... Like a daycare running from center to center for an activity. The only good thing I have to say about the place was that there were a lot of friendly people and I liked the fact that I was done working at 3:00."
bad,It was a decent place to work for college. It was very flexible.
bad,Supervisors are very focused on goal and do not care what you do to get there.  Stressful sales environment.
bad,"Wells Fargo is one of the reasons people have such a bad perception of large corporations. I was extremely excited to start at Wells Fargo because of all the growth opportunities but quickly found out in order to grow from a personal banker position you pretty much have to be ruthless. "
bad,"Stressful job, abusive customers.  Must have thick skin not to take complaints personal.  Good co-workers."
bad,Goal Oriented and micro manage.   Can drive you to feeling stressed.
bad,Contantly changing policy which really was frustrating to the loyal customers.
bad,"I loved the people at Wells Fargo. "
bad,"Have to work hard in order to advance"
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of nothing but negativity coming from the mangers, constantly putting you down, and making it known that no matter how hard you tried nothing was ever good enough. I learned that no matter how much you push a product to reach your sales goal no will always mean no. I love the other tellers and the bankers that I work with! I just wish management was better. The hardest part of the job is reaching sales goals when customers are not interested. "
bad,"As a teller, I am expected to complete the basics of banking services day after day. I typically lead the branch (and top the district) in sales and customer service reviews. I have become bored with my current employment and do not feel that I am mentally challenged. I have expressed this with management and there has been a complete and total disregard of my feelings, as well as a denial for any promotions. Therefore, I find myself in an environment that stunts my personal and professional growth. What I do enjoy is the variety of people that I get to meet and the conversations that I am able to enjoy with some of my customers. I get complete satisfaction when I am able to take care of an issue for them, or notice a problem with their accounts that has not been brought to their attention before."
bad,"asked on daily basis to sell sell sell no matter what. did not have the customers best interest nor the employees. non management co workers were good, management was non realistic with goals."
bad,I just finished my training so I cannot speak about the company yet
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"When I first started this job it was exciting to work here. As the years passed by there was no raises given, no promotions. I was at a stand at this job. Although i am presently employed because i have no other employment."
bad,high turn over rate. supervisors are average. good payouts.
bad,"Poor pay, unprofessional work place, unrealistic sales goals. Rude managers"
bad,Building long term relationships with customer.
bad,"Expected to put in unpaid overtime because contract was written for only 40 hours a week. Never given enough time to thoroughly test changes. Everything was rush, rush, rush. Manager was often saracastic and cutting."
bad,Company is more concerned with how many products a customer can have than what is best for the customer.
bad,Wells fargo is a place to work at they are always laying off people
bad,Great people to work with. Continuous change kept job very interesting.
bad,"I work 6 days a week. My manager can not answer any questions that I ask. I am told when I can and can not take the vacation time I have earned. Management only cares about sales numbers, lack of compassion for customers."
bad,"Reviewing signed loan documents, drawing loan documents."
bad,"High turnover leaving feeling of lack of job security. Very micromanaged, great team members but very little work life balance."
bad,"Terrible, Too much favoritism, ridiculous sales goals. Pay raises were not given fairly, all the tellers and bankers constantly complained about the job. It was very unpleasant/difficult to work with unhappy people. It wasn't uncommon for employees to take part in unethical business practices in order to achieve goals. I wouldn't work at Wells Fargo bank again."
bad,I worked at Wells Fargo only a short time. In the time I was there I felt it could have been a great job with different people. I plan to pursue a career in related fields.
bad,"Good benefits, management doesn't care about you, to pushy with meeting goals."
bad,5 star corporation. It was a pleasure to be employed with them and now I am seeking my next long term employment with a great company.
bad,A typical day at work includes handlng a lot of money and dealing with a wide variety of people and attitudes. I have learned a lot about the inner workings of financial institutions. Some of the info I have gained helps me better situate my personal financial life. My co workers are a great group of people and we all get along with one another which is rare in some workplaces.
bad,Great company to start with outside of college.
bad,"I took this position while the firm was still Wachovia as a banker. The problems started after the M/A with Wells Fargo. I was shipped across 3 different branches and 3 managers in my short stay there. I was supposed to enter their financial advisor training program, but it never materialized."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,not good and extremely pushy sales tactics. Unethical behavior from lots of people in order to hit pushy sales goals.
bad,"It was great talking to the customers, meeting new people, co-workers for the most , great and welcoming. What may feel was helping the customers would sometimes conflict with Company. Most enjoyable part was feeling the Satisfaction of knowing I actually helped someone with my experiences as a teller."
bad,"Get logged onto the systems about half an hour ahead of my shift time. Take some calls, having a great time with my customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is to have someone highly irate get on the phone and thank you at the end of the call because they needed a little extra kindness, compassion from me."
bad,"I really didn't mind the actual job, got to meet some great people and the actual job was straight forward. The reason I quit was because they wouldn't work with me at all to get on a better shift. I was working from 3:30-midnight M-F. I also enjoyed the fairly laid back climate that the job provided."
bad,Work like a slave all day!!!!!
bad,"My typical day would be processing commerical deposit dual control, bring all confidently information out to work with during the day. Receiving my cash box to help with the customers and working the drive-thur with large cash handlings and deposits. Helping customers with any questions and concerns they may have to better assist their financial needs."
bad,"Answer phones,e-mail's and Supply demands."
bad,"They tell you ""we all started from the bottom"" and expect you to climb the ladder one step at the time... But this means that you need to jump many hoops without tripping in order to get there... making it impossible. Besides, they let you go in a heartbeat if there is no need for you."
bad,"The job title is ""Retirement Service Representative"". Beware: Management make their own rules and you found them always contradicting on their statements. Policies and procedures changed by the hour. If you needed help you couldn't ask a manager. I did learn about 401k's. Moving up from this position??? forget about it! Avoid moving to this department if you can!!!"
bad,handle cash and transactions for customer and excellent customer service at all times
bad,"Working for Wells Fargo has landed me a lot of new friends that help me not regret the time spent at the bank. However they start you off as Part Time but work you Full Time, so that they can give you half the benefits allotted for Full Time employees. From day one they are overly sales oriented with goals expectancy beyond reason."
bad,"Basic teller work. Emphasis put on sales other than customer service. BUT you are also graded on your customer service. Very hard to do both at the same time as customer wait time is a big part of customer service. My co-workers were young and more interested in their texting and where they were going to party on the weekend. As part of the ""management"" team I was not given the backup from the store manager to coach and teach a good work ethic. Only 1 other person there was in the same boat as me."
bad,"Teller, CSR(Customer Sales Rep), Personal Banker"
bad,It was a good place to work. People were friendly I learned a lot from the people I worked with.
bad,"not a fan of wellsfargo,"
bad,"Wells Fargo was not fair to their employees. The benefits was good, but the pay was low and the company didn't back their employees."
bad,"The company has great health benefits, but the job can be very stressful due to the high sales goals."
bad,WF is established company with good infrastructure. Provides benefits and good amount of vacation time which cannot be used when is needed. In many branches only one 15 min break and 1 hour lunch. Sales pressure very strong.
bad,"Not a pleasant experience, no proper training, no appreciation for the employees, does not comply to their own policies."
bad,The job itself was great! The benefits were outstanding. To bad no one holds upper management to the Same standards as regular employees. They have there minions and favorites and only stick up for them.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"It was an easy job to get, but getting anywhere off of the call floor is near impossible.  They have this ""STAR"" method for interviews, past the first one and pretty much, they already want you to have the experience before they promote you.   Great job, not great advancement."
bad,I work as a part time teller (30 hours) and go to school twice a week and the manager can’t even work around that. Seems weird that a company who does tuition reimbursement can’t even work around their employees schedule. I was told that I would have to be scheduled a full day (regular business hours) on days that I go to school and if I miss three days because of school that would lead to termination? It doesn’t make sense.
bad,No structure. Constant change. They move departments around like little armies. Senior management doesn't seem to know what they are doing.  Overtime is expected but not mandatory -- yet. Work-life balance not great. Doesn't matter how much time off I get if I'm still stressed out all the rest of the time. Scarcity is huge here. Tired of trying to find a department within the company that isn't in total chaos so looking outside.
bad,"Management was usually very demanding and asked you to do questionable things to bring in sales. People who were good in sales advanced very quickly, but if sales was not a forte, they were left to not get promoted."
bad,"The company was all about pushing banking products. At my branch I had a lot of people who were regulars that I saw every week, and we were forced to sale to them. If we didn't sale enough at the end of the week, we had to stay after banking hours for a meeting. There was a lot of pressure put on the bankers and tellers."
bad,"Very competitive, stressful, and NOT as they try to make themselves seem. This is definitely a place for someone who wants to grow gray hairs in their early 20's from stress, anyone who wants to fake a crazy smile all day and act like you enjoy your horrible coworkers. Everyone who works here is full of sh and are just so insanely full of themselves. Would not recommend, especially if you have any morals."
bad,"The job was great, a great team, fun company culture, regular lunches to celebrate success etc. Then it all changed. With the account opening scandals our opportunity for sales was cut in half and they were even penalizing how we pronounced words during inbound and outbound calls looking for any opportunity to write us up and cut employees.."
bad,"Hard to have skills recognized by management. Left hand often does not know what the right hand is doing."
bad,"Work long hours,  Work life balance is poor.  Pay is decent.  Environment is heavily regulated and ""big brother"" is always watching.  Company does not value employees."
bad,"Wells Fargo would be a great company to work for if they worried and helped their team members grow. They have been through a lot and instead of focusing on both, the customer and team members, they are only focused on the customer. The company feels like a big boat in the middle of the ocean with no sense of direction. They don't know where they are going and their team members are up in the air. They have ignorant District Managers not knowing how to articulate and are always giving a false sense of security."
bad,"Starting pay is competitive with market, but you have to move within the company or leave or you will fall behind. Management is pretty open door but teams are across multiple time zones, which creates some difficulties."
bad,Wells Fargo is a great company if your just looking to get your foot into the banking industry. Lots of opportunities but it depends on who you know...
bad,The company was all about numbers and if your number weren't up you were in trouble. Even if you were performing well it didn't matter.  The supervisor and manager were helpful when needed.
bad,"High paced and very stressful work day"
bad,"My experience was 5 star until I was placed on a new project. The manager was corrupt. Ordered people to lie on status reports. I refused and things got tense. "
bad,I don't wish to go into any detail about Wells Fargo in this forum- I worked at Wells 3 different times and all 3 gave me a chance to add value learn and contribute to the growth of the company
bad,I ended up having to have surgery and went from full time (8-10hrs) to part time (4-6 hrs) to work ability (4hrs if i could handle working that day). my supervisor decided he would give a hard time because i was taking prescribed medication before work. he stated that it was illegal to do so.. even though my Dr & HR approved it. I ended up being told I could quit or be fired because Iowa can do what they want. I quit..then got a lawyer and was told i should have never quit.. i should have let him fire me.
bad,People were promoted based on sales numbers that were not accurate or indicative of talent.  Management was focused solely on sales and promoted inexperienced and uneducated people because of sales earned by manipulation or language.
bad,"If you were in a contract job, make sure you put your head down, try not to get sucked into the Clique machine, make sure you have a babysitter who's understanding because you will be working a lot of hours. In my case, it was 14 hours of overtime a week, mandatory minimum. Also trust no one."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"There isn't much to really state here. The managers were incompetent, pushed for sales, but then wouldn't even allow me to interact with customers and allow me to grow, and then when I needed to be there for my family they suggest I leave instead? Have the guts to fire me if you just don't like me. So glad I left. Never going back, and telling EVERYONE to work at a different bank."
bad,"I worked as an intern for Wells Fargo in the summer of 2018 and had one of the most boring, unproductive summers of my life. Everything of relevance that I learned and completed came from my own self-teaching and I did not ever feel that I was at a place I'd love to work at post-grad."
bad,"Branch manager and service manager were the best, the two of them knew exactly what they were doing and the team was also friendly and some of the best people to ever work with. The company itself, certain policies and upper management is terrible. Time off was difficult you had to request months in advance for a doctors appointment, also they don’t work with students schedule due to banking hours."
bad,"Good pay no sales, not much I can say about the company other than that I wish I could say more but I can not, I was able to work here for 6 years and wish to grow."
bad,I like working with the team at Wells Fargo.  Everyone is very helpful and patience. I was only hired on at 20 hpurs- part time so not liking that but hoping to get full time soon.
bad,"Upper management should have apologized to bank management, bankers and tellers for the unethical sales we were told and taught to do. Many bankers were threaten with termination if sale quotas were not meant."
bad,"You have to be VERY cautious of the ""time"" on calls. They tell you in training, ""oh it's okay, don't worry"". I get why they say it, so you don't feel overwhelmed. But once training is done, they expect you to be as fast as an experienced banker when your clearly not."
bad,"A typical day at WFDS was to get there on time (which i did), be seated and logged into the computer by your start time. I logged into numerous systems so that I was prepared for the day."
bad,"Wells Fargo itself is not a bad company to work for. What I had issues with was the morale of the workplace. I had submitted numerous requests to every person I could about the conditions of the branch I worked in and nothing was ever taken seriously. HR is not there for the employees, they are there for the company, and when someone becomes a liability they cover their own butt. I was terminated on grounds that were 100% falsified. I was under investigation and was not aware of it. When I was questioned, but was intimidated by the internal investigator using tactics such as them having camera footage, but I was never given the opportunity to see it. When my manager called to fire me she gave me one reason and told me if I had any further questions I was to contact HR. In doing so, I found out a laundry list of falsified facts and I disputed each one. Even the guy from HR said they sounded deceitful. Sure, wells Fargo has great benefits but they are not there for anyone but themselves."
bad,"It's ok to work there they need better HR and payroll something needs to be done."
bad,"Great company to work for. "
bad,As a Manager we were more like a babysitter with very little encouragement towards the employee's personal issues. No real room for growth. Most likely for promotion you would have to transfer to another department.
bad,"Terrible place to work for, terrible benefits, & very demanding. My overall health has declined since working for this company. It's very much like high school with no guidance what so ever. Very unprofessional employees who are more concerned about a potluck then their own unprofessional demeanors. As a matter of fact if they can break you they will. Very unfriendly and competitive place constant change yet no extra pay just extra work."
bad,Lots of strict rules. Managers that do not know how to coach. Only good thing is benefits and pto. I've work at 5 different locations and your work experience varies greatly by branch.
bad,"I worked there 2+ years , and was well liked by clients and coworkers .The pay was horrible for a big city like LA , the location I worked at charged $245 a month! Management was so-so, there was a lot of favoritism. I didn’t feel supported as a new working mom ."
bad,"Some employees are held to tighter quality standards than others which I pointed out, at that time my supervisors attitude changed towards me drastically because I tried to level the playing field."
bad,"Good benefits, decent pay, poor ergonomic assistance, poor management, too big to care about you, difficult to post out, wf recruiters make s point to ask questions designed to rule you out, not key on your attributes"
bad,"I have worked for Wells for 3 years recently was trying to advance within the company, did well in interviews yet never received a job offer. The interview process is now so long and ridiculous that it takes weeks to get an initial interview and another few weeks to find anything out. The only thing that has kept me here so long is my service manager because she is awesome, by branch manager has no clue how to actually manage a team. The hardest part of this job is dealing with the customers who get mad at you for the banks policies."
bad,"Not the best place to work, may different locations to apply for but the chances of them picking you over an internal within their branch are slim to none. Management cut down, short staff."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"The interview process was slow and the decision time for a job offer took longer than it should have."
bad,Always get to know employees an management . They will use you and throw away good employees all because the manager Has horrible work ethics  and doesn’t know what he is doing . Management doesn’t know his policy and procedure . The manager will over work you so he can leave
bad,"This is a place that has certain people that advance and employees that does not meet financial goals are looked down on. Great pay  and benefits but feels like you are in school all over again with random test, always being watched and humiliated for mistakes that can be easily corrected. If you are easily stressed and depressed this is not the place for you to work.PERIOD!!!!!!"
bad,"The company made it seem like it would be fun to work for, but it was quite the opposite. You will get depressed, anxious, and mentally challenged there. You will have to speak to a therapist after being there so long. They do not care bout bereavement unless it’s your mother. The only benefit I would give them was the PTO, health/dental/vision insurance and Tuition reimbursement. Everything else was pure stress and unwanted mental issues!"
bad,"Most days were busy with no down time and on your down time you would have no time to remotely talk to co workers or breathe, you would have to read and review A LOT of policies. you had to be in your A game otherwise you might lose youre job. people are very stern about their money. make sure to do everything right othewise you could get a ""slap on the wrist""."
bad,"I enjoyed many of the people I worked with, but the sales goals and expectations were often times unattainable in a way that still provided good customer service."
bad,"Wells Fargo does not care about it's employees, let's just start there. They will do any and everything they can to outsource any jobs they have, regardless of how much the government cuts their taxes. This bank has been making record profits and cutting jobs in response to that. You will never feel like more than a cog here. PTO is pretty generous, and the pay isn't horrendous (though it isn't very good either). The health insurance is a complete joke ($3,000 DEDUCTIBLE????)."
bad,unrealistic expectations and above god attitude. customers there are amazing and deservr better then what they are given. associates doing shady things to keep there jobs
bad,"Management was terrible. Never recognized for doing well, often criticized over the smallest things, such as not using my name when greeting a customer.  My branch manager went out of his way to make me uncomfortable. My manager often broke policy and procedures. The benefits and customers were what made the job bearable but I eventually had to leave because it was such a toxic environment."
bad,"Branches are called ""store"" which alone tells you it's about sales.  Which I have no problem doing, but only if it benefits the customer.. not to make a quota to keep my job."
bad,"I’m sure at one point in its long business history Wells Fargo was an amazing company to work for, but in my recent experience it’s just a pit stop on the way to better pay elsewhere. The schedules are not convenient for anyone with a family, and the pay is terrible for anyone that doesn’t live at home or have roommates. It definitely helps that there are people you work with who can understand the struggle and willing to have a mutual vent session!"
bad,"Wells Fargo is still struggling after the multiple unethical practices in recent past. "
bad,"If Conti Mortgage was still open I would have never left. The Owners was a real person. "
bad,"Micro managing in the mortgage lending environment. Office closed down twice and the position was eliminated w/out a new position offered. Minimal base pay, would have been nice to have a commission on closed files as well."
bad,"I'll start by saying that I am not averse to hard work, but here at Wells Fargo, you will go from one emergency to another, work crazy hours, have little direction, and be accountable for a lot.  The benefits are good, but they don't make up for the culture."
bad,Personally I loved and hated working for Wells Fargo. It made me realize how much I did actually make a good choice for wanting to pursue a career in banking however it also made me realize just how much I loathed retail. In my personal opinion and what I was lead to believe about the job is that customer service comes first and that selling to someone who needs or would benefit greatly from the product is acceptable. But selling a product just to meet a sales goal is far from my beliefs. I've worked for a few other financial institutions since Wells that work in the manner of only selling when it benefits the customer and Wells only cares about the numbers over its customers and employees.
bad,This review will not be helpful since I worked at the Wachovia unit well before Wells Fargo acquired them.  The ratings are for Wachovia as I have no experience with Wells.
bad,"They will update process and procedures without insight or knowledge of the department they are changing. The PTO is fantastic however, people who are recently hired make as much, some more, than tenured employees."
bad,A typical work day is filled with updated processes and procedures.  It is important that changes are implemented quickly to make sure the customers are satisfied.  The hardest part of the job is helping each team member get on the same page. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers grow and reach financial goals!
bad,"I spent 13 years with Wells Fargo, 7 in management.  While I met many great people and colleagues over those years I felt that advancement was highly dependent on politics and not performance.  Upper management was not concerned with development of its employees and front line leaders.  They were more concerned with fixing it's poor public image and profits."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"some mid-level managers rule by fear as opposed to encouragement/ Customer Loyalty is a huge deal  that is judged by surveys, however there are too many variable outside of an employee's control that they are held accountable for."
bad,"Banking should be about financial advising, not financial gain. To summarize, the job culture was to manipulate people into investing in more bank products than they were able to afford or maintain."
bad,"My direct manager (only my direct manager) and coworkers were amazing to work with.  Beyond that and the health benefits, there would be no other positive feedback I would have for the company.  The room for growth was non-existent and any possibility of more than a 1-2% pay increase was unheard of.  The management (president and vice president) that handled the personal lines division were not personable, poor listeners, and had no experience in the field.  Banking experience does not qualify as insurance experience.  The culture that was created prior to my departure, was toxic and many of the paths they chose for processes were wasteful of time and cost.  More time and money was spent on quality assurance, reports, and micromanaging rather than increasing productivity with more man power.  "
bad,Not a good work environment. Management goes out of their way to intimidate their workers. Management is very hard to communicate with. They almost are never at to building.
bad,"Micro Management by administration. Assistant Manager acted more like a baby sitter than a manager. Favorite employees were given special privileges. This may not have been a common trait but was in my department. Discrimination was also tolerated, especially towards African Americans."
bad,"Working at CIC is an absolute nightmare. If you're use to a call center environment, getting cursed out, arguing with customers day in and day out, love being told when and how long you can use the bathroom per day, being timed for using the bathroom, not being able to talk to your coworkers, constant change in procedure that effects your numbers negatively (which can lead to termination), and poor training, then this is the job for you."
bad,"Work hard to meet deadlines. Team members are good people, work together very well. Good job support. Team managers are good, caring, intelligent people. Corporate culture tries to appear friendly, but you have to remember they look at the overall picture and the bottom line. Keep your resume fresh! Hardest part was required unpaid time off. Make sure you are okay with that and plan for it before onboarding. Best part is the relationships formed with like-minded professionals."
bad,If you have a high AHT then you’re doomed to have your boss make you feel like an idiot. In hiring prices was given one schedule and then forced to take another.
bad,"They all play politics with management and no matter how hard you may bust your tail, you cant move up without an act of God. As soon as someone who's in the clique doesn't like someone, its only a matter of time before they're out."
bad,Wasn't a great place to work.
bad,"I was only working here temporarily, so my opinions on the topic probably aren't of much value. however overall I didn't like how much sales were involved it felt very forceful to me"
bad,"Private Banking entailed either working remotely or in the office."
bad,"Management hasn't recruited any advisors to the firm in at least the past year, so it's not a place that's growing.  In fact, this is a branch that's losing more people each month than it brings on (lost at least 5 advisors in the past year, as well as 2 support staff members)."
bad,Sales goals were too high at the time i was working there. Some management employees were terrible and did not know how to lead. Everyone was a kiss a@s and it really annoying the smart ones
bad,Would never endorse this company! Worst culture and ethics in any company that I have ever worked for in my career. My overall experience with them lead to my leaving an industry that I loved and had been a part of for nearly a decade.
bad,"I worked in this area 3 years, there was no advancement I got another job put in my two weeks and requested to be off the second week due to having time but my time wasn’t approved, I decided to go ahead and take one last occurrence I had 1/5 days approved.  I called in those 4 days my former supervisor wanted to put me down as a no call no show so it would be bad on my record if I ever want to return. Management was the reason I left, she missed countless days, arrived late, and took extended leaves, but wants to give everyone else grief if you arrived 2 mins late. I went through the proper channels and knew I was taking an occurrence, but she thought she could stick it to me one more time."
bad,"Work cannot be managed efficiently because they pile so much on your plate and expect you to meet unreasonable SLAs. Guidelines must be followed to an absolute T due to banking compliance and regulations. If you slip up, penalties are stiff as you are deducted on monthly reviews resulting in no salary increase. If you want to take time off, the workload is more than doubled in order to prepare for your time off so coworkers can cover customer cases while you're out."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"I had to be very careful, mistakes that occurred tend to be serious regardless of the amount, and there is very little help in correcting them.  Certain managers knew nothing of how to work the system and often sat around doing nothing, but was quick to fire people if something went wrong.  Employee environment was very toxic with a lot of drama."
bad,"I hated working for Wells Fargo TOO COMPETITVE AND MY MANAGER SUCKED! The breaks were short. I was under paid yet, expected to help close at least 3 cards a day with a bankers assist. You spent the whole day trying to pitch things people didn't need."
bad,2 or more meetings per day to talk about sales. I learned that my morals were more important than my job. My co-workers were great but the management was all about getting their next bonus'.
bad,Wells Fargo does not live by the company visions and values. This company sets standards and avoids upholding them by giving bogus and biased exceptions that only support share holders and affluent clients.
bad,"Wells Fargo has a huge problem in company culture. This is mainly due to some of the older generation that are within the company. A lot of the problems that the company has in culture and progress is ultimately held back due to the fact that many of them are unwilling to change. In addition, a lot of people create a toxic environment. There are a lot of people who talk behind each other back, don't understand personal boundaries or professionalism in the workplace. Nor do they really understand their role in the position. There are a good number of people who inflate the position."
bad,"They are not worried about anything except their profits. The truly do not care about the customers that put that money in their pockets. The work environment has potential, but the company truly does not care about anything but their bottom line."
bad,"Enjoyed helping customers, was told not there to help customers, there to get them more accounts with Wells. Credit Cards, Loans, Checking accounts, etc..."
bad,"Poor management when I was there. "
bad,"just a job nothing special "
bad,"There should be no sales goals...customer service should be more important, while working there I met every goal besides the sales goal and was not respected for my excellent scores."
bad,Im sure youve heard of the recent scandal. It was the peak when i started. THe managers will pressure us to open accounts to hit our goals and it was very stressful
bad,Solo promocionaban por amistad no por los estudios o preparacion
bad,"Plenty of opportunities to learn more about new lines of business and hone new skills, though pay may take years to catch up to your experience. Wells has one of the best PTO offerings and the 401k plan is good, though all other benefits are mediocre. Too many levels of management. Culture varies wildly and is almost completely dependent on your manager."
bad,"Advisors do not agree or support local management; in most cases, they are extremely vocal about his performance (or lack thereof).  The processes and procedures at Wells Fargo Advisors are extremely cumbersome and make almost each task unbearable to complete.  There are too many steps involved to complete the simplest of tasks.  Also the training provided is inadequate and most time insufficient.  Many Client Associates are put to the task with minimal or no training and then their Advisors brow beat them until they eventually leave the company.  I have seen this now on 3 separate occasions.  Since the Advisors are the ""money makers"" it seems as though they can do whatever they please and treat their Client Associates as they please with no regard to respect.  Local management is very hands off and doesn't seem to have a clear picture of what is happening within his own branch.  When asked for suggestions in making his branch the best place to work, those are often ignored or there is some excuse as to why these suggestions cannot be implemented."
bad,This is the perfect job for someone with no family obligations. No flexibility in scheduling. Does not work for single moms. However has good benefits.
bad,Horrible company to work for. Very much money hungry and did not provide time for family. Wanted staff members to meet unattainable goals. This had the potential for a high stress work environment.
bad,"Most of the time I was not sure I would continue to have a job. I was moved to multiple positions, never was offer any mentoring to move up in the company"
bad,"I worked in 4 different departments over a span of 6-7 years. Twice while working there my job was downsized( Management level).I worked in the mortgage sector as well as Dealer Services(Auto Lending). In both situations, senior leadership was very deceptive and hired more people on and put on an overall front as if business was doing better than ever, only to blind side everyone weeks later. There is very little stability and trust with the company."
bad,"It was a pretty slow environment. Stressful as far as goals were concerned. Management was real poor. They lacked professionalism. Favoritism would get you places, your hard work wouldn't."
bad,"Wells Fargo offered me a good starting position considering that I had no experience. However, layoffs take place and pay increases weren't frequent. Be open to other options and make sure managers were available without attitude to assist."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Wells Fargo was a great place to work years ago and in the Texas market.  Throughout the years it changed and especially in Mobile.  They have awesome products, services and technology.  But, the culture is hard core, cut throat."
bad,"Management increased production quotas without providing training or guidance to achieve results. Manual process, needs automation and ability to provide feedback."
bad,I left because there was no room for advancement in my area.  I did like the company.  I have no idea why I am being asked about a company that I left several years ago.  I left the industry altogether.
bad,"The management was constantly putting pressure on employees to open accounts or loans to customer, even if they were unneeded. Constant threat of being fired if sales goals were not achieved. management steered sales towards certain employees of the same race or background. Making it impossible to make sales from walk-in customers. No matter how was your performance as an employee or the branch in general was doing, it was never good enough."
bad,"Wells Fargo has shady business practices and overworks their employees."
bad,Wells Fargo is a difficult place to work. They provide many great benefits but you have to sell your soul to get them. The sale tactics are not sustainable nor ethical. The culture is riddled with dishonesty from the top down. I enjoyed those who I worked with other than the  double faced Middle management that basically requires you to work unethically and would turn your back on you if you were caught being unethical.
bad,"A good company to their customers, but not the best company to work for. As a TM in the corporate office, the culture was definitely depressing. The expectations are far too high for the capabilities of TM's. That falls on management though."
bad,"you make your own hours , fast pace work environment. Not properly staff and to slow with technology, the company to big ( basically a dinosaur) to catch up to technology."
bad,Back end procedures were inadequate to close loans efficiently.  Processors and Underwriters were poorly compensated and were not empowered or willing to make common sense decisions.
bad,Unfortunately this bank is more concerned about making corporate driven quotas so they can get a bonus than it is about taking care of their customers.
bad,Hostile work environment. Unrealistic expectations and EXTREME pressure to open a certain number of client accounts. I enjoyed my coworkers and management and I remain in contact with all of them.
bad,Extremely stressful and threatening environment. frequently made very unreasonable demands on employees.  OT was required at Management discretion and never optional- particularly on week-ends and frequently with very little notice
bad,"Look elsewhere. Was once very good but now has steadily deteriorated to be no fun, no appreciation for the best managers, and no spirit. It does have the capital to turn things around if the company so chooses."
bad,It’s  very clear on the mortgage side of the business that they are wanting to go to a centralized platform do you have better compliance controls. At the same time they want you to recruit to a bad reputation and one of the lowest paying mortgage jobs in the industry.
bad,"The department worked well together and was really team oriented.  It was always fast paced to make sure everything was paid on time.  The financial advisors would get rude at times and disrespectful to staff if their was an issue with processing their expense report, but we always had the support of each other and management."
bad,"Was a fun job, this department has dissolved. Lots of favortism by management, employees allowed to work way past the time that they should have been fired."
bad,"During my time at Wells Fargo as a banker and as a manager the typical workday involved being pressured into opening accounts for everyone who walked in through those doors.  Although it was difficult to do so, opening accounts were far more onerous during days when store traffic was slow.  That's when we had to either cold call or contact customers from our book of business.  Since my departure from Wells Fargo, I have heard that a lot has changed.  The sales culture is not nearly as aggressive as it was in light of all the lawsuits.  Despite the pressure that we had to endure on a daily basis from store or district managers, I am proud to say that I was one of the few individuals that refused to succumb to the temptations of opening fraudulent accounts."
bad,I am not a sales person in the least. I went into a teller position at Wells Fargo not expecting a sales aspect at all. But it ended up being very competitive and ALL about the sales aspect vs just helping people and getting to know your clients. The only cared about you meeting goals.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"clock in, report what your sales will be for the day, help customers all day and report to manager almost every 5 minutes of where you are in sales for the day. All day is spent on making sure you would hit your goal if not you get chewed out by managers and upper management at the end of the night. Stay overtime to try to make phone sales after hours. Go home stressed out and have anxiety for the next day."
bad,Negative impacts based on media negativity - impacts to employee's that had absolutely nothing to do with the unauthorized accounts being opened.  Devoted employee's with stellar integrity that always do what is right for the customer are being penalized daily.
bad,"Initially we were told to tell people that their phone calls are being recorded even though they were not recorded, thus giving customers that false sense of security, thinking they can provide some proof of a conversation if necessary. And that they were at least 6 months behind on thousands of claims. They were paying me $15.50 an hour to process them. We had to document every minute that we were at work- even taking note of when we used the bathroom and for how long. "
bad,"The policies and location in India was not good. It was similar to the call centre in Chennai, hence dint like the culture. Also they must increase the pay. And there must not be any contracts if you are chosen to fly to other countries."
bad,"Typical works day hours is about 8 with an hour break which is nice. Other than that, thats it. Management can not accept constructive feedback and most do not know how to properly manage and operate. Career advancement is a joke. Its built on politics and a ""Buddy System"", OR out of convenience for Management. Upper and direct Management uses a ""cookie cutter"" approach. One strategy does NOT work for everyone and all locations which demonstrates the lack of leadership in Management all together. If a Banker or Tellers explicitly tells you what will work for them, do not try to inject something else. You need to actually listen to them."
bad,"Due to their company-wide scandal, WF changed their sales policy and bonuses. If you are a sales queen/king, keep looking. I promise you any competitor pays better commission. If you are wanting to move away from retail banking and go into securities, keep looking. WF does not require their bankers to be licensed like other competitors do. Clients have lost trust in WF, and the competition is having a field-day because of that. It is very true that retail bankers can make a six-figure income here in DFW, but you must have a sales and entrepreneur backbone. If you have the drive and energy to sell bank and investment products do not settle at WF, keep looking."
bad,Too focused on sales instead of their employees and customers.  Stressful job that I would not go back to.  The benefits are ok at best.  The customers were the best part of the job and on a bad day they were also the worst part of the job.
bad,"WFB has one of the best training grounds in the financial industry. The skills I learned and developed there were transferable. Though a very stressful work environment, I take the positive and apply it elsewhere."
bad,"I was grandfathered into Wells Fargo due to the Housing market crash in 2008.  While we were Wachovia, the work environment, pay, management and opportunities were GREAT!  However when Wells Fargo bought Wachovia out.   The work environment changed drastically."
bad,"Corporate. environment, mostly keep your head low and work on advancement. The 'What"" does not matter -- it's all about ""How"" and ""Who."" This is evident in the continuing inability to emerge from the scandals."
bad,It was all about sales. If you didn't make your numbers you would find yourself with corrective action. After so many you would eventually be terminated. Job advancement was extremely hard. Some employees compromised their ethics in order to make the required sales.
bad,"The culture at Wells Fargo is non existent. It was not a place of employment that I was excited to go to everyday. "
bad,The job was stressful. Their current problems with ethics and sales standards have been well known for years but management never took any criticism seriously until it exploded.
bad,"people's other more recent posts are more reliable than this, as my experience was within a very specialized group within a very specialized department that focused on development of alternative channels."
bad,"people are nice, compensation fair, working environment good, security not good. overall company expectation below expectation specially when it comes to security issues"
bad,Very prejudice workplace.  Did not enjoy my time there.  Management was not conducive to a good work environment.  Very stressful.  all management cared about was numbers.
bad,They do not care how much dedication or effort you put into the company and will fire you to save their own butt. I went to work giving 150% and receive multiple recognition for my hard work and customer service. I even took on management duties and 3 roles to help out on top of my overloaded work duties. They give you a long list of things to do and don't compensate with pay. They just keep adding work loads onto your plate and expect you to handle it and not give you a raise. Then if it comes to saving their butt bc the scheduled you to many hours. They blame you and fire you to save their end. Requires major butt kissing to get promoted and you have to be favorited.
bad,Management tends to favor others. Low ball rises and the benefits are terrible. Very hard to move up unless you have connections. Love the people but was treated unfairly by upper management.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"A typical day is full of meetings, providing detailed and accurate updates to upper level management, and collaborating on defect resolutions."
bad,"The pay was alright for an entry level position. Very fast paced and detail orientated. Mistakes cannot be made because you're dealing with people's money."
bad,Workplace culture that lacks the sensitivity to family life balance. It is a great place for people right out of school. There is very little time between calls.
bad,"This is really based on corporate policy in conjunction with management. If your manager was optimistic and communicative then you had it great, but if you had a very inflexible and strict manager then it was very very stressful and expect adrenals to be taxed."
bad,"Very lowball salary starting December 2016 with no advancement opportunities.  Guidelines provided by management frequently changed, often contradictorily."
bad,"I witness many unethical actions to be able to meet goals , Bankers will open fake account just to be able to meet quota. Didn't provide employees with the mandatory 2 15 minutes breaks. I had a really bad experience at least in the branch i worked for."
bad,the training and support do not exist with in the department. I felt like I was beat up everyday. Did not feel valued after working for WF for so many years.
bad,Wells Fargo has lost its vision and values after the whole lawsuit and even before that. Management is a joke of caring of your personal growth. Do not go there.
bad,"It's been many years since I worked for this company. I never did feel job security at Wells, even 15 years ago.Focused way too hard on sales back then, still do today, and look where that got them!"
bad,the former ceo and the retail scandals are sinking this ship. and the junior team members are paying for their mistakes. what a pity. work life balance is good as on average they cant utilize your full potential.
bad,The company is very focused on customer care which is great but have forgotten about their employees.  They put a lot of pressure on sales which is what got them into trouble in the first place.
bad,"Poorly compensated , Mandatory OT with no pay, Combined (hybrid roles) job titles with low pay to keep from paying employees for heavy work volumes. Treated as a number and no an individual."
bad,Wells Fargo bring people in under false pretenses as if you can move instantly and that's not so you have to really befriend someone in management to push for you to have a leadership role in the company they are inconsistent and put so much on the employees to most despise coming to work. The most enjoyable part of my job was being with my team members on breaks an lunches
bad,Well fargo off wheatland in 20 was a very past pace I loved it but alot was not right they did what they want stayed on the phone an no paying attention
bad,"The projects to which I was assigned were behind scheduled even before I arrived.  I worked hard to get these projects on schedule but was told I was not a good match for this department,."
bad,"The pay was good, but there is no time to spend your money. You have no social or family life. This place drained me emotionally and mentally. Very negative work environment poor management, terrible work hours. Stressful place to work at. They work you like a machine and there is no training, lack of respect, lack of consideration, not understanding when it comes to family issues. Not even the pay or the benefits could hold me there."
bad,"I Worked 8:00 A.M.-5:00 P.M. Monday-Friday. I worked in two different departments while employed with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. "
bad,"Sale goals were rediculous. Managers were never on the same page, as you would ask one thing and then another and you would get two different answers. The company does not put their customers at best interest."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"I really enjoyed working at Wells Fargo at first, but I had a little daughter at home with several health issues and the Job/ work balance became too much for me to handle with trying to get her to and from Iowa City for doctors appointments."
bad,"Wells Fargo is a great company to learn the ins and outs of banking, and overall business concepts. I learned a great deal with the company and am grateful for the lessons learned. "
bad,"Lots of ""lifers"" which clog any advancement for younger people. This would not be bad if the lifers were inspirational or even slightly interested in developing others. Unfortunately, they all tend to be set in their ways, unwillingly to think beyond themselves."
bad,Proper staffing needs to be a priority. Particularly in an environment with several new individuals. The binders that were introduced could be helpful if there was enough time to work on them.
bad,Not a good experience with this workplace! However I will make that statement geared to my specific department at the time and not the company as a whole.
bad,"poor management"
bad,"They didn't care about customers. All they seemed concerned with was pushing products and opening new accounts, no matter the cost. The culture there felt very unhealthy in general."
bad,"Unfair practice, Allow friends, and white men to work the best branches, to make the most money. People of color are given the less productive branches in areas where there is no growth the people are credit challenges, and no new construction."
bad,"I left this job to move to Indiana, but I might have anyway."
bad,"Many times employees are treated as a number, not an asset and viewed as replaceable.  This is not the values portrayed by the company and do not feel that Wells Fargo is committed to investing in their employees, rather more concerned about profits of the company."
bad,"I felt I was shut out because I was a white male working in a majority of African American women, who could be threatening and took care of each other"
bad,Wells Changes everything its no longer sales based but customer service base therefore the jobs are almost never secured you might loose it the next day.
bad,pushed sales heavily to the point of making employees quit.  Recently got in trouble and created paperwork instead of sales goals to micromanage employees.
bad,"When I initially started at Wells Fargo, the culture was all about their employees. It was easy to see that the company's outlook was if you take care of your employees, they will take care of your customer's. As time progressed, it was more about the profit and money. It very much became a culture of employees just being a number. The employee morale continues to decline."
bad,"Typical day is sporadic.  Leadership is a bit scattered and, even though sometimes well meaning, very seldom follows through with anything positive or has your back.  Certainly met some great people over my time there, although typically met outside of my work unit."
bad,"Due to the recent scandal, WF has made a number of goal and compensation changes. This is likely just until the issues blow over. While the company is very cognizant of legal issues going forward, they are already returning to sales pressure of years past"
bad,Although they are working toward a great PM program they are currently in chaos and are not sufficiently transitioning from technology to Project management.
bad,"Little opportunity for advancement.  Management has an us vs. them attitude towards team members.  Annual pay increases are less than rate of inflation.  High stress and low morale due to unrealistic workloads and deadlines with no possibility of overtime to achieve the production goals set for you.  Pay is low for the volume and complexity of the work being processed."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Typical inbound call center.  My beginning management I felt was understanding in the beginning but became uncooperative and mean at times.  I was going through a lot with my health and just wasn't understanding.  My ending management supervisor was very understanding and help train me and help me increase my scores on the job.
bad,"Management is very hesitant to assist when there are work place conflicts.  They put on a good front like they are about their employees.  I have been with the company for 20 years and when it was Wachovia, it was a great place to work, but since becoming Wells Fargo the culture has truly changed for the worse."
bad,HAd a great experience learning what I want to learn which is about money. Was limited to what I was able to learn which I understand due to the training that is acquired.
bad,"pay is OK "
bad,"I personally had a very bad experience working for this company, since my manager was very insensitive and unprofessional. She kept ""coaching"" me on anything I did. There was a lot of threatening in case I don't meet my manager's expectations."
bad,"Sales performances for exceeding all sales goals forconsecutive quarters."
bad,Wells Fargo is a big company; so my experience is based on the department I worked in and the people I worked with. I don't believe that its a reflection of the company as a whole; however the people I worked with (very small group) were different than what I saw in other departments.
bad,Just absolutely a mental tear. Took alot out of me. The pay definitely didn't compensate for the short amount of time you're supposed to learn the job
bad,"While Wells Fargo is a global banking enterprise, they operate a sweat shop environment, forcing employees to generate high, unrealistic goals.  Hence the most recent class action law suit for creating faulty accounts by employees forced generate unrealistic numbers for new accounts.  "
bad,"Unrealistic sales quotas, high turn over, always threatening to terminate you if your sales aren't good. Everything that's being put on news about the fake accounts and sales are true. Stay away."
bad,"Very fast paced and employees are wonderful. Lower mgmt. were wonderful. Goes thru employees very fast, had a lot of fun working with this company. Loved the fast paced environment."
bad,"I worked for the company about 8 months..in those 8 months I felt like I wasn appreciated by my peers especially my leaders. I felt I got on all 3 of my manager's nerves & got scorned for asking the same questions over & over again. "
bad,Culture is not what it appears. Some very nice people but the basics in the company are money first and people far down the list. People are treated as numbers.
bad,"Sales practice used to be very aggressive; however, now focused on providing positive customer experience. I like the fact that the changes being made is centered around doing what's best for the customers"
bad,The benefits offered are the best I've seen. Ample PTO and flexible schedules. Love the HSA that is offered and the opportunity for company provided funds.
bad,Poor direction of management.  Judged on quantity not quality of work.  Your success is also based on work of others.  Good work hours though.  Would not recommend for a career.
bad,Working directly with the field and direct supervision is a challenge for all investment advisory firms.  Given the size of WFA the regulatory environment is a great challenge requiring daily flexibility with work load and expectations.
bad,I have no comment about Wells Fargo or the position that I had at this company. I was there for such a short time I have no opinion at this time. Sorry.
bad,"Management would say one thing and do the opposite. Job was not secure. Always talking about letting people go. A typical day was to go beyond and above for the customer. And it was never enough you can show empathy, Because Wells Fargo had some issue with the bank, they want the worker to take the blame."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,The work environment was all about hitting goals.  There was a daily driving force to sale whatever you could get a client to agree to.  My manager was not present very often and was not motivating.  The company it self is strong and has good products.
bad,"The management at my branch was almost non-existent. My branch manager was a over grown child that constantly was messing with employees even while they were with a customer. The employees didn't speak up because they had before with no change. By the end of my time with Wells Fargo, the company had brought in the district manager to investigate the reason our ratings had dropped. But Wells Fargo itself as a company is not bad, I had many good experiences at other branches."
bad,No worklife Balance  The supervisors are petty and vendictive.  There is a constant struggle to get proper training.  The sofware used is aged.  Up to date software not available to complete day to day task.
bad,After working for this company for a couple weeks I learned they have poor leadership. Team leaders discussing employees business across the floor. One particular team lead would down talk to consumers. Team lead advised me when to take time off to assist me with my wedding then used the time off against me. Very uncomfortable environment and I understood why when I learned of the high turn over.
bad,I do not feel like your job is secure as a teller at wells fargo especially if you don't have proper support or two managers that both think they are right about everything
bad,Working at wells fargo was sad. I worked for this company during the time when they would do anything to open up accounts for people. our managers would tell us to open up accounts for people even though they didnt need it or couldnt afford it.
bad,"Wachovia was a great bank to work for! I had started prior to the change in DE back in 2011. "
bad,I enjoyed Wells Fargo and the knowledge it provided to enhance my selling and customer service skills. I learned so much about the banking world at this company and the training is outstanding.
bad,The only thing important in my experience was how many accounts you could get someone to open.  It didn't really seem to matter whether the customer needed it or not.
bad,"As is well known at this point, Wells Fargo is a high stress employer with a sweatshop type of mentality, and this caused many employees to be pushed to take illegal steps to generate business which the company has come under fire for recently"
bad,"This company doesn't secure job placement. I was awarded Top Production in October after being there for 6 months and was let go a month later. No verbal warning, written warning, or even a notice. Your work gets unnoticed. The company doesn't like to hire on temps. Their set with the team that been there 1-5 years and if you come in competitive you'll be wasting your golden skills that will never get noticed. Unethical when your talent goes unnoticed and unappreciated."
bad,"At least four direct supervisors micromanaging every action made, no actual authority given to inspire confidence in employees."
bad,"Very busy, which i appreciated, i do love a thriving business. i learned a lot about business and how to manage my finances. Management changed quite frequently, not consistent not something i was happy about but dealt with. My coworkers were amazing, made  the environment less intense. the hardest part of the job was catching fraudulent activities."
bad,This is a very fast paced environment .. the job is easy the people are great. Flexible schedules but have long working hours. And massive overtime.
bad,"forced to sell to every customer whether or not they need the products."
bad,"worked there for more than 7 years,turnover was unmeasurable,very busy,management come and go. Benefits was alright, lots of sales,referrals was a must.I would recommend a friend though."
bad,"•	Working in Enterprise Risk Management department and responsible for handling High end production support on all risk management applications."
bad,Company is not good to work for. Managers don't know how to ack. They are very unfair. They always make you sale even if the sale is not there. Job security is not god.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"I worked as an operations clerk in the home mortgage department, utilizing my skills of critical analytical thinking and providing a lot of quality control and training for new hires."
bad,I do not wish to use my time to provide this information and should not be necessary to submit a resume her are your 20 words
bad,Fast paced environment.  The job is really 2 fold.  A lot of analytical reporting and then normal Executive support.  Very busy long days each day.
bad,"had to work the 6 days of the week, wells fargo is now a retail bank being that its all about selling, offering and referrals. not only you have to sell accts loans and credit cards but auto insurance home insurance, renters and life insurance its crazy you have daily goals and if for whatever reason you don't meet them prepare for a cool down with management to discuss what you could of done different or better. so if you like for management to be on you 100% of time to sell sell sell this is the place to be working at."
bad,"never become a banker. worst job to ever have."
bad,"Wells does a great job of getting as much work out of one person as possible. Not willing to add resources (people) to enable team members to collaborate and do their jobs effectively. This limits what you're able to excel at as you're pulled in too many directions. "
bad,"They have the best training program anywhere for bankers, but once you complete training, they really drop the ball on continuing education.  There are MANY online, self-directed courses to take, but rarely are they clear, concise, and very informative.  There is no follow up other than management using a checklist to make sure everyone who needs a class can show on their corporate transcripts that it was taken.  I believe that is why turnover is high (nearly 100%)for them, for a bank or financial institution.  They really need to mean what they say about ""investing in their people.""  Otherwise, the home life/work life balance is great because it is truly a 9 to 5 (ish) job."
bad,"Wells Fargo puts unfair expectation on the employees.  I can see the expectations in a big city, but they don't take in to consideration the location of some branches.  With these unfair expectations, if the employees don't match the quota, they are fired."
bad,enjoyed the tellers I worked with. management cared nothing about there employees. all management cared about was tellers forcing the customers to sign up for products they did not need
bad,The company has a great culture and many benefits but if you work in a department that doesn't allow you to express your desire to move forward your stuck
bad,"Great company to work for if you're a student and don't have any children. Benefits are great and also their Paid Time Off. It's a very fast spaced company and if you're a fast learner, you'll do great."
bad,"Wells Fargo has the same mentality as Bank of America. It is a very high pressure sales environment, especially for front line tellers. It is difficult to advance within the company unless you know someone. My management team is a joke. My store manager, a female, usually dresses like she's going to the club instead of managing a bank. My service leader barely knows her job and thinks it's ok to talk down to employees in front of the customers then no one understands why the service scores continue to decline. Some of my co workers are alright. Some spend more time causing trouble and trying to pass work off to others than just doing the job themselves. Hardest part of the job is the extremely high pressure sales and difficult management team. Best part of the job are my customers and a few select teammates."
bad,I started out as a CSR in the commercial lines department in 2005. I didn't know anything about commercial insurance at that time. I met some great people who became my mentors.
bad,When I started Wells Fargo everyone was so jolly and welcoming. Then months later I began to see the real truth about this company. They are liars and they just care about getting sales. The will make a customer get 5 different checking accounts for no apparent reason! The management was horrible! There was favoritism and lots of dishonesty. My manager was stealing money and the company knew about it. All they did was kept moving her to different branches. Smh at this company.
bad,Wells Fargo is all about sales. I didn't mind selling products but they're overly aggressive. I wouldn't refer anyone to work for this company. The only good thing is the quarterly comps are amazing.
bad,"It was interesting, I wish I could have stayed in my own group and continued to collect debt,Instead they tried to put me on this terrible group that worked 7 days a week"
bad,"extremely diverse company, i still am employed with this company, however after 8 years, i do believe its time to move on"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Commercial lender, limited underwriting or approval authority. Wells Fargo is more of a sales enviornment with limited detail to customer needs and solutions. Worked with some great people but management is only focused on unit sales"
bad,"Management was awesome, co-workers not so helpful, but because I genuinely enjoy catering the customer's needs I loved going in every day."
bad,"Guidelines and policy changed daily, and work teams rarely communicated. Management leadership not always on the same team.  Job security always in question."
bad,Wells Fargo was okay to work for. Some people I really enjoyed working with. It was a call center position. I learned about mortgages.
bad,The above department was limited in advancement possibilities. There was a block in that department for three years. The incentive plan was awesome as long as you met the metrics; which every quarter I received
bad,"Reviewed credit card applications that were in between easily approved and easily denied. I learned how to think more effectively and efficiently to be the quickest at a job where production is the most important aspect. My coworkers were great and pushed me to be better. The hardest part of my job was watching and dealing with decision makers come up with illogical solutions to small issues, meaning they would work small to big when ""fixing"" the department's problems. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming up with solutions to overcome poor management decisions."
bad,"Same as current job with the exception that cross selling banking services and software (CRM Programs) were a greater part of the business model."
bad,"I helped all of the brokers during my tenure at Wachovia Securities.  It was fun and sometimes hard to keep up with the demands of 13 individuals.  I enjoyed being productive for everyone everyday but on some occasions, things didn't always work out as planned.  My favorite part of the job was greeting and helping customers."
bad,I would open and have to be ready for the drive thru to open at 7:30am. While helping customers in the drive thru I would also work on our night drops. At end of my shift I would balance the vault along with my drawer.
bad,Taking around 80 to 100 calls daily. I learned a lot about the banking industry. Management wasn't the best. Co-workers are the best part of wells Fargo great people to work with. Hardest part of the job was pushing products on customers that didn't need it or didn't have the money for the product.
bad,A typical day consists of phone calls back to back from the time you clock in until you clock out. Not much room for growth unless you play politics.
bad,company closed officed during the market crashed and purchased another bank.   They had very high metrics that many in the company could not meet.
bad,Wells Fargo Bank concentrates more on selling products that people do not necessarily need to raise sell quotas. Employee's are not valued and the raises are horrible. Your work load will increase with no pay raise.
bad,"Pay well w/great benefits, no backing. Expected to use inappropriate sells appeal. Encouraged to be unethical. Bullied out/intimidated because of my race."
bad,The position I am currently in isn't very challenging but the culture and work environment is positive overall. Every day is basically the same with little variance. The hardest part of the position is finding appraisers to complete a report in a short amount of time. Otherwise this is a position that could very well be automated one day and probably should be.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Wells Fargo is a good employee however, they do not pay well  in comparison to all the other financial institutions in the area."
bad,"A typical day at work is going in an getting my day started by greeting my work family. I have learned to make the most of what you have to work with and not to complain, be thankful. The hardest part of my job is when my machines go down because i have a deadline to meet daily. The most enjoyable part of my job is the communication level is have with my co workers."
bad,it was good pay but high pressure to sale overshadow everything way too many conference calls. Good training but tight with raises
bad,"On the exterior, it seems to be diverse and upbeat. However, on the interior there are many untold issues that employees face day to day."
bad,"Management is on you if you dont meet quota, I was threaten to lose my job withing 1 week if i did not meet 45% to sales in less than 2 weeks on the floor. I was told differently during training. Management want their money and will let you have it if you do not meet your numbers. Remember your numbers are their numbers."
bad,"I like the environment of Wells Fargo, however they have no flexibility when it comes to your personal or medical needs or restrictions. Depending on which Management you receive there is a lot of favoritism that goes on that prevents room for advancement"
bad,"This job was very stressful. However, the re-existing kept me passionate about my job and I have a passion for helping people any way that i can."
bad,"It's shocking how good Wells Fargo can be at organizing and communicating massive layoffs.  It seems to be a regular business practice for Wells Fargo.  I worked with many people who were back after being laid off at least once or twice in the past.  Be prepared to be laid off at any time.  The severance pay is generous, but it's still a strangely normal process for senior management."
bad,sell sell sell. the customer is second to numbers. They are driven by getting product to clients regardless of need as long as they make their bonus sales numbers. Every morning is a hammer session unless you produced accounts that the customer may/may not need
bad,"Dont work at the Corinth Branch. Management just talk and giggle with one another, they dont do any work but expect everyone else to work. Try a Different branch Just not Corinth, Tx branch."
bad,"The retail side is incredibly sales driven to the point that it's quite common to see bankers pushing products and ""solutions"" on customers regardless of what they want or need. Customer service is laughable, the only thing management cares about is solutions goals. Management rotates out every 6 months or so."
bad,"all they cared about was their money and raises, they did not care about integrity"
bad,"They don't care about their employees, only themselves. Training i steerable and gets worse once you get in the store. No one helps at this brach, poor management that are stuck up and rude."
bad,"They do not know how to appreciate employees and management has a way of finding their ""favorite"" employees and if you're not one life is miserable."
bad,"come in open drawer form night before. immediately start transactions from the drop box in dual control. "
bad,"sales not reasonable"
bad,"Morning huddles, role playing, discussing needs for the day, learned how to ask questions and uncover needs of customer sitting in front of you, could be something they need that they didn't realize they needed. Met some of the nicest people as far as co workers there, able to work well together and very helpful. Again I love people, it is my passion to help out"
bad,"Work was fast paced and easy. Management was hardly there, and co-workers were all fun with great personalities. "
bad,Stressful work environment. Sales driven to the point where the bank lacks in customer service. High turn around rate at many of the branches due to the lack of respect and value for team members depending on their position.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,I loved the type of work I did however there was not much room for advancement. For the most part co-workers were friendly.
bad,You are pushed to sell rather than provide customer service.
bad,"4 managers in 9 months. A proactive attitude and taking initiative was not well received. Procedures changed weekly, sometimes daily. Sitting all day."
bad,They need to pay their tellers more for all the hard work we do. To much politics going on at work with management. They need to believe in their employees skills.They care to much about numbers not about their employees.
bad,I thought the culture with this job was horrible tons of favoritsim and if the manager didnt care for you as much then you had to work ten times harder to move up in the company.
bad,My experience at this company was negative.  I was never appreciated for my hard work.  Over worked and compensation was extremely low for position acquired.
bad,Wells Fargo is a great place to work. There is strong employee support for work/life balance and diversity.
bad,Some of the greatest co-workers in the world. There is lots of room for advancement.
bad,"Wachovia was fun and engaging. Once they became Wells Fargo, they lost their regard for their employees. Most customers of Wells Fargo feel like just a number or a dollar sign. Well the employees felt no different."
bad,"This job has very little written procedure that is easily accessed"
bad,"inbound calls "
bad,"very strictly regulated and ""by the book"". Plenty of opportunity for growth and advancement. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of schedule flexibility and management can be great or awful depending on location."
bad,"A typical day is taking up to and over 100 calls a day from credit card customers."
bad,"A day in the life of a Wells Fargo personal banker consists of meeting with clients to help them achieve financial goals. "
bad,"Wells Fargo is a good company to work for, in my opinion, it was not a good fit for me."
bad,requires sales no matter whether the customer needs it or not you are expected to suggest a product to them. if not you will get bad ratings by management.
bad,"It's been many years since I worked at Wachovia.  As I remember things, the feel of the company was that of a ""good old boy network"".  The management that I had was not good.  But he was so protected that there was no one listening or noticing what was actually happening.  Luckily I was recruited by Citi and was able to leave after a year."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Wells Fargo turnover rate is exceptionally high. Work life balance is basically non-existent.
bad,"I enjoyed the company when it was Wachovia, then the merge with Wells Fargo started and I was placed in a position that I was told I would be trained for and was never trained. When I asked for training I was told I would get the help and never did. When issues started coming down on me about my position, I told my managers that they were suppose to give me the proper training. I decided to leave shortly after that since I still wasn't receiving the proper training."
bad,"Bad place to work, Management Is horrible and most have had no management experience in the past. They are promoted due to sales numbers and most sales people make horrible management. Hours are bad depending on store."
bad,"The company is fine, its the management in Boca Raton's Overflow office that is terrible.  Rose has no idea what she is doing. Some underwriters had 2 loans to underwriter the entire month of July.  The favorites are being feed loans to maintain authority.  Boca will never make it and everyone is looking for a place to go!"
bad,Working for this company was the worst job I have had to date. It was not only mentally draining it was also discouraging. You get paid as much as somebody who is less qualified than you are and you only get a 30 minute lunch break. On a daily basis you will take 50-60 calls and it will be angry people who want to close their accounts to Wells and you still have to make referrals to them. The coaches need to be retrained.
bad,love working in the city the co-mute to work was great daily.
bad,"Loan Servicing Specialist, lots of computer work, very analytic, I did not enjoy being in a cubicle all day"
bad,Basically answered phone calls  from beginning of  the day to end. I learned a lot as far as programs and tools to take with me to my next job.  Don't have any extra time to talk with co-workers. 
bad,"stressfull, ok place to work. Managers could be more helpful. "
bad,"Bank hours are great.  Off by 2 on Saturdays and every Sunday off is seriously 95% of why I work there.  But its not worth it.  They are extremely sales driven and the customer surveys your performance is rated on is worded in a way that confuses customers and kinda screws you over.  Plus the bonuses they rave about are not reasonable and hard to earn.  Lets just say every one of the employees at my branch, (tellers, bankers, and even management) are always actively job searching.  "
bad,"typical day at work sitting and keying in data entry, some days training other co workers and working other areas in the departments"
bad,No comment on the subject they pay more then most but have higher goals then other banks.
bad,"Sales environment team leads will come by and ask how is your day going and they are only referring to your sales quotas. Very unprofessional. More than one time they didn’t pay me and had to stay on them about getting things done. Team meetings are held but only to tell you what you have done wrong. It’s a call center so I expected rude customers but the work environment was very stressful. Everyone comes in with the same pay regardless of experience or education. You have to ""hit the numbers"" for 6 months straight to see any type of pay out or to move to a different department. I learned that this place is very unorganized."
bad,"greet customers,seek out needs and direct them to the right person to meet the need, teller transactions,sell money managment products and insurence related services.I have learned much about customer service and product knowledge. Im not the manager but I have managed the bank in manny different ways.I love my co -workers.the drive is too far.i like working with people."
bad,Our job was to work along side the negoiator to help homeowner keep their home. We would gather all supporting documentation and submitt it over to be process. bank would figure out a way to help homeowner keep their home. They would suspend their mortgage payment and place them on a forebearance agreement til deal was worked out.
bad,Work with branches to cross sell Merchant Services and bring in new Merchant accounts.
bad,Great value for customer service and work ethics. Enjoyed working here through college years.
bad,I love the bank roll getting to know my customers know what they need and helping them in life along the way
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Too many managers without enough experience managing people. Typical day is micro managed down to the last minute. Wasted time filling out paperwork which is repeated day after day the same stuff. Co-workers are great. you are expected to be more of a cold caller and a door to door salesman.
bad,"Inbound call center-Took calls and helped customers with navigation on company web site. Recommended products and services to help meet customers financial needs. I learned about finances. A lot of micro management and not a lot of opportunity to be successful. I felt like there were a lot of expectations whether it was sales, adherence to quality assurance, or handle time per call but not a lot of resources that would allow me to be at my best. I got along with my co workers very well as I always do. The hardest part of the job was selling to customers who called only to have questions answered or needing assistance with online navigating. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people who I worked with in the office. They were extremely fun to be around and nice."
bad,"I began working at the bank, when it was called First Union. Over time, and mergers, we became Wachovia, and then at the end, Wells Fargo. The employee experience from Wachovia to Wells Fargo, is as different as night and day. A typical day in my department began with emails from my manager, berating us about how our department wasn't doing well. There was typically no encouragement, just the ""do it or else"" attitude. I learned many things in the course of time, like running and funding tickets, closing and opening accounts, taking care of brokerage accounts, etc. The management at Wells Fargo isn't very good. The bank puts tremendous pressure to perform on the managers, and therefore, if things don't go well, the managers take it out on their subordinates. I put up with a lot of mental abuse from my last manager, so much abuse, I ended up having to seek out a therapist. My co-workers were a dream to work with. We all supported each other, and helped out each other. We were the only sane ones in our department. The hardest part of the job, was trying to meet deadlines, and meet production quotas. The way the programs were configured, made it impossible to do the work accurately. They were constantly changing the rules of how to do things, or they were ""forgetting"" to tell us the little things to make the programs work."
bad,"I was one of the individual who used to make the work of Barclays Bank very easy,convinient and Perfect.I used to go round from one bank to the other doing the pick ups and deliveries on timely manner for there customers satisfaction."
bad,Hard worker who excels at getting the job doen accurate and quickly
bad,"Ok place to work although too demanding. A typical day is attending to customers, opening accounts that fits their needs. Assisting at the teller line by lobby leading, and dual control."
bad,"Typical at work involves taking calls, and selling products to customers. I learned more about the banking and mortgage industry. The management staff for the most part doesn't value their employee's opinions. My co-workers are great, they make the job fun and interesting. The hardest part of job is not feeling valued as an employee. The most enjoyable part is my co-workers."
bad,"high pressure to meet or exceed sales goals for the day, lack of attention to the customer, I was highly pushed to closed sales on products that ""could"" benefit the customers but in reality did they did not necessarily need. the hardest part of job was to keep your integrity when offering customers choices to meet their financial needs. the most enjoyable part of the job was resolving issues that customers had with Wells Fargo products and services that they should not have been placed in."
bad,This bank took over another that I was working for. They are all about selling and nothing more. Customer service is third if that in their culture when it comes to dealing with clients.
bad,"This job would not be a bad job if it weren't for the constant drama created by the team members and the lack of communication and management skills of the managers. You can't ask for a better pay scale and benefits of a job that you can come into with little to know experience, but in the end sacrificing your happiness isn't worth it."
bad,I learned a lot about personal finance and what the average consumer is facing in our world today. Wells Fargo helped me grow my sales career.
bad,Loved working in banking and learned alot with this company I just hated that every person that came through my window I had to shove banking products down their throats.
bad,"In a production type of work speed and accuracy are key elements because of nightly deadlines. Getting to know co-workers was a bit difficult. One either signs in and starts keying or goes standing by their friends' stations and chats. I really enjoyed the incentive pay which was based on speed average, number of fields, and low errors. Every Encoder dictated their own paycheck amounts. That was Wachovia! Once Wells Fargo took over everything started to change on a daily basis up until there was little left. Multiple departments were eliminated which left me jobless. Oh well, life goes on."
bad,"Worked at Wells Fargo for a week. Had a car accident, call off, came back to work with doctors note and discharge paperwork from the ICU, and got fired. How lame is that."
bad,"Customer service, cash handling, processing bank transactions."
bad,If you don't mind being on the phone the whole time this job is for you!
bad,"I first came to the company as a teller and was promoted to the personal banker role less than year later for high performance. With that being said, this is definitely a sales performance oriented company. If you don't like sales, this is NOT for you. The bonuses are pretty good, the health benefits recently changed in TX which is one of the reasons I left, it sucks now. They usually change alot of the sales' goals too with very little notice which can be frustrating. Be prepared to keep up with all the ever changing audit regulations as well as a good clientle base. If you can not sale, WELLS FARGO is not for you. I saw alot of good people fired or ended up quitting for failing to meet goals. As a banker you are responsible for not just checking account goals, but loans/lines of credit, partner referrals, and all other products the bank offers. If you are not hitting your goal, your store manager loses on their bonus as does their district manager, so on and so forth. Trust me, they will not let you mess with their money...sometimes it's a 'by any means necessary' mentality..."
bad,The pay may be better than most banks but its bait to bring you in. The goals are absurd and the management philosophy even more absurd. The mantra is completely customer service centric but in the branch is a completely different story.
bad,Company is not customer oriented. High percentage of late closings.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"The company needs to be in compliance with other trainers, I felt the department was not organized to give quality work but was more focus in quantity."
bad,Sales sales sales. Banking is not just about taking deposits or making withdrawls anymore. Banking is a retail business. Assume the customer wants what you have to offer them at all times. Write down your goals for the day and you better surpass them.
bad,"was an ok company until securitas bought out pinkerton wells fargo burns etc , now its securitass and it is horrid they truely care more about proffit not employess futures or keeping clients not gaining future clients"
bad,"...because otherwise, you'll be on the chopping block from Day One. ""SELL! SELL! SELL!"" is what you'll hear at every huddle conducted everyday before the 'store' (what they call the branch) opens. Good luck trying to be yourself while selling the gazillion products they shove down your throat to the same customers that make up 80% percent of your day, as well as the customers irate because of the fluctuating service changes at the fault of Wells Fargo. The benefits are nice for what they are, but it's not enough to deal with the huge axe they keep high above their heads."
bad,Management has little to no interest in providing a good work environment. They are more interested in following the current employment trends instead of developing their employees.
bad,"I applied here hoping that it would be the start of my career in finance. I was hired in to a basic operations job where I did the same monotonous thing day after day. After a year, over half of the people who had been in my orientation group had quit. We had been told when we were hired that we'd have a lot of chances to move up within the company, but that proved false. It's very difficult to even move sideways. I have a bachelors degree and yet started off making around $25k/year. The opportunity to get raises comes very rarely, and is based solely on whether or not your boss wants to give you a raise. If you are unfortunate enough to have a boss who cares nothing about you, then you may as well give up on ever seeing a raise. If you have an issue with a co-worker or your boss, don't bother speaking up, because upper management doesn't care. I had never before worked at a company that seemed to care so little about me and after only two years there, I couldn't wait to leave."
bad,"Positives:  Pay and Benefits are good.  The people on my Team support each other and care for each other."
bad,"Unfulfilling corporate environment. Executive leadership has been under Federal scrutiny for years; cultural change initiatives for the workplace have been ongoing during that time yet employees are forbidden to talk about either the ongoing toxicity of the workplace or the numerous scandals that have beset the company."
bad,"The company is okay. Work environment is very stressful, lack of communication is unfortunate. The company as a whole could show more appreciation to their employees."
bad,Overall this place is not a good place to work. Pay is low and they care more about the bottom line then improving their employees. Constantly take away holidays and make you use your own PTO
bad,"Worked with some great people, however management seems poor. Very political. Do not expect to get paid proportionally to the work you accomplish. Good place to get a career started, build some work experience and skills and leave. Once I put in my notice to leave, management stopped speaking to me. This happened to many other as well. Expect high turnover and resentful managers. Work life balance is there and the work is relatively easy. The best part was the people I worked with."
bad,"So, our district manager made it difficult for anyone to get out of my location which was in side a Vins grocery store. We are 7 days a week and only get one weekend off out of the month. My service manager is very flexible with scheduling if you have school, children, etc."
bad,"It's not what you know, but who you know and if you fit into their picture of a perfect employee that will get you ahead, it is very much a social club environment, and the popular people are the one's who get ahead, especially if they are good a sucking up. If you are someone who only speaks up when you have a good idea, something proven, expect to be ignored or one of the popular co-workers will steal your idea and use it to get ahead."
bad,"Too much pressure and work put on employees constantly.   Instead of piling work onto employees until it becomes a problem,  then trying to fix it; use the analytics and data to prevent the problem from happening in the first place.  Hire more people if you know the workload calls for it.  And believe me: you know!"
bad,"When starting at Wells Fargo I was suckered in with the admittedly amazing pay/benefits (probably the best in the financial industry, honestly), however, after being there for about a year you start to see false promises come to light in regards to growth opportunities. Management 100% picks and chooses favorites and those are the ones that will be successful regardless of if they are able to perform simple job tasks or not."
bad,"Inclusive and great advancement opportunity at start of tenure. Management very supportive. As titles changed, management deteriorated and personal abilities were exploited without proper compensation. Felt overworked and unheard during review times."
bad,Couldn't stand working here anymore. The job duties/job itself wasn't terrible but management really enjoyed micromanaging. Made you feel like you were incompetent.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Poor management in most of the branches!  Mangers just move up without any knowledge or experience in managing people or luck of education."
bad,"No investment in good technology that would make the firm and trading floor successful, found myself have no joy in going to work everyday, employees tended to act condescending and unforgiving to my mistakes"
bad,"They are a bank so no additional spending is done anywhere."
bad,"Pay attenttion to detail. Be nice to customers with speed. Favoritism existed at my branch. My manager didn't like me, so when i applied to other locations, she sabotaged me because she didn't want to see me progress."
bad,Not a very good environment to work.  They just prefer dealing with their people. Not enough help sometimes.  No good encouragement to perform.  Only for those that are accepted.
bad,There’s a lot of potential for learning many different aspects of finance industry and finding certain path for your career  how ever not enough pay for amount work and responsibilities.
bad,"I hate working there. Being a bilingual processor I do not get paid enough for all the extra work I do. Pipelines are large and their main focus is production, production, production."
bad,"If you like management and senior management to lie on you and others, then this is the place for you. Sales practice have now moved towards customer surveys and asking every customer about their financial situation. Which means daily presser and riding your back, with constant harassment from upper management, who doesn't care about you or the customer. This is a sinking ship, going down fast."
bad,"While I enjoyed being a customer service representative for Wells Fargo, my real passion was coaching the new hires. To see them really prosper and know that I was the one who taught them. It made me very proud. Unfortunately the opportunity for advancement was near impossible to achieve."
bad,It would be nice if management could relate to the jobs being preformed in which they manage. Some areas of management make changes that may not be in the best interest of the company in the near future.
bad,"Recent organizational changes within Auto have completely ruined the culture, the environment, and the overall opinion of Wells Fargo. Prior to the Leader change in Auto, we had a family environment. People actually enjoyed being at work. They let go of some of their best and most knowledgeable employees. They have reorganized the org chart several times and can't seem to stick with an org chart, which in turn has completely put off our customers. It is a very unstable working environment and has created hostility among the employees that are left."
bad,The wells fargo call center environment was meant for aiding customers in issues with there mobile app account or online banking experience but the  environment pushed unnecessary sales.
bad,"Back when I was employed at Wells Fargo, the sales quota drove our day to day experience working there. It was difficult to meet their daily goal for opening accounts. That didn't take away from the fact that we had a great team at the time. I also understand now that their daily goals are different compared to in the past."
bad,Every two years your gonna get laid off... sometimes they will rehire you... and sometimes they will get you a severance package and you cant return if you get that.
bad,"Wells Fargo used to be a great company to work for. Now it is just another big bank. In the last couple of years or so, they’ve brought external so called leaders who clearly don’t know what they’re doing and have been taking the company down with poor decision making, along with poor vision. Trying to fix things that weren’t broken instead of really fixing what needs fixing!.... which is Upper Management and H. R dept."
bad,"It took them a week to let me know I was terminated, when i was supposed to be notified within 24 to 48 hours. Also, their policies do not apply to everyone"
bad,"Wells Fargo, initially was a great find for me. The benefits package is what snagged me. "
bad,Typical big company agenda with constant changes and reorgs. Lots of talk about how to do the right thing and solve problems. Not much action. Work life balance is a thing of the past. Recent re-orgs have lead to more work.
bad,"Although tellers are not considered sales men, they are required to meet a quota of referrals as part of their job which counted heavily against the branches overall performance. Given that sales are not my forte it became overwhelming for me to meet such quotas and the micro management from supervisors did not help. I was under too much pressure and stress while still going to school to obtain my bachelors degree."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"I appreciate the offer to review, but decline to review this employer at this time.  Thank you for the opportunity to review Wells Fargo Home Mortgage."
bad,"A typical day at work: "
bad,The collections team was ruthless and wasn't even what I applied to do. Wouldn't recommend to anyone unless they don't care about what happens to real life people.
bad,"Great coworkers, but I didn’t have a great experience with the company. I was working over time, working the position I was leading into and doing the work for. It was given to someone else with less experience due to management. I was top person in the branch and still wasn’t getting the credit for it. He didn’t want me to succeed and threatening me about my position. It was best for me to remove myself for the company and find something different."
bad,"The job itself was okay as a home/business equity collector until they cut our bonuses from a set departmental bonus (the dept hits their goals) to a competitive bonus where 60-70% of the department no longer received their bonuses and they altered the requirements.  My bonus dropped from >$700/mo, to ~$380-$180/mo even though I was in the top 3 for our department.  If I had one bad phone call my bonus would drop in half since the 3 of us were always tight on our stats.  The direct management was easy to work with but the management above them saw us as a number.  The entire department was laid off shortly after I quit.  The one good thing about the company was if I pointed out errors in the computer system or ways to improve it they would pass it on to IT/database design team and usually implement the suggestions given to them.  Also, each of the supervisors/managers that I directly reported to were very friendly; I'm sad to hear that they lost their jobs."
bad,"the quality of the job reviews are based not on user feedback but solely by what a distant manager thinks, who is not involved in day to day work flows."
bad,"High levels of stress, high volumes of work for staffing levels. Good exposure to different investors and back end underwriting. ok facilities. Insufficient interdepartmental communication."
bad,"It’s not that bad I guess depends on where you work. It’s just a place where you have to make sure to always keep your head up at all times. So yup, it’s that much."
bad,"The job was taking calls from credit card customers. The customers were often abusive, and management was not supportive to say the least. The training was comprehensive, but nothing prepares you to work for the most hated bank in the country, in the customer support department. My coworkers were OK, and occasionally the calls were great, but mostly they were awful."
bad,"Too many systems to manage and update and none of them worked together and slowed down efficiency managing jpb responsibilities.  Long hours, constantly changing and not adhering to properly to bank regulations.  Upper management needs to change and support talent and provide tools and training."
bad,"I worked as a Financial Crimes Specialist for almost 2.5 years.  The job was okay and had it's purpose, but it seemed that the company was not very invested in trying to develop its employees.  Without any coachings, warning, or otherwise, I was let go after another department determined that I should not work for the bank anymore.  My record was spotless during my whole employment there and they weren't willing to give me a chance to prove myself when this other department made the decision."
bad,"Had the Virtual tools for interacting for 4 to 6 hours a day on the phone / computer.  Executive management needs to improve, but mid-level management has, or had, problems."
bad,"You can gain a wealth of knowledge from interacting with team members and building rapport with customers. However, a lot of the work has shifted to self-discovery and managers have their own personal interests ahead of your personal development. A lot of gossip and stress can hinder develop within and outside of the branch. If you want to work for the company, focus on your own professional development and do not step outside of that box. The pay isn’t enough for the work that you will do and the stress of management. The benefits are excellent."
bad,"I worked in the call center. If you are an extremely creative person that likes to move around, this is not the job for you. You will be on the phones all the time, every move you make is monitored. Even your breaks. It was extremely micro managed and your growth depends on your manager and how well you passed your phone quality. Oh, don't forget to turn your screen off when you leave for the evening.  You will get an orange sticker on your desk, an email, and a one on one if it happens more than once, about turning your screen off. Not monitor, the screen.  Make less than 95% on  calls, and kiss your option for interview in a different department goodbye. Follow that script. Period. Policies change overnight. I had a great team in training though. We had a great trainer that was not recognized for his talents."
bad,"Not much to say about the job its just not enough for me, great place to work if you are in college and that's it unless you plan to move up in the company"
bad,Not a great company to work for at this time. Wells Fargo is going through a transition because of all of the CEO changes and with unethical business practices.
bad,"At the beginning of every shift, I will review the shift notes of the Security Guard who was on duty before me. This will give me a good idea of what issues happened before my shift and any pending issues to be closed to be watched for etc."
bad,"A typical day at work would include checking on the previous days work, take phone calls, service clients and Financial Advisors.  "
bad,"Their reputation makes it hard to build relationships."
bad,Too much emphasis on selling banking products by  upper managements.  I'm not sure that management truly respects their customers.  Emphasis always on sales instead of customer or employee satisfaction.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"No communication at all which leads to frustration. I have really hoped to build a career with this company, there are a lot of opportunity’s however, over the last four years the employees have gone from people to expendable numbers. The benefits are amazing and they still have that going for them."
bad,The starting pay for a teller is $13. You’re overly pushed to make impossible sales goals or risk losing your job. You are over worked and under paid. They do a finger print for a background check. You’re started with vacation time that can be used almost immediately.
bad,"full pay scale can never be reached, during good years the bar is raised to assure target is missed and bonus/ compensation pool never gets fully funded."
bad,"Worked for wonderful bank called Wachovia, suddenly we were taken over by Wells Fargo.  Things changed like night and day. Wachovia believes in Quality- Wells Fargo in Quantity"
bad,"Branch Managers don't know anything and do not follow policy and procedure. Branch Manager and SM talked bad about team members to other team member.  The District Manager promoted her ""friends"" to SM & BM even if they were not ready."
bad,"no comment, as I don't want to jeopardize my position at this time, not being pressured to say anything more and do not appreciate that this is a requirement from you"
bad,"A lot of work required for poor pay. Compared to branch managers, service managers are paid poorly and are expected to run the branch according to compliance."
bad,Wells Fargo leadership in most departments no nothing about the line of business. They don't hire enough experienced management staff. Wells Fargo directs their focus more on hiring new members rather than developing current team members
bad,Management was never engaged with employees or day to day workings. There was a lot of tension between other employees in the office which made it an uncomfortable work environment.
bad,Management is not really helpful. When you need help it does not seem like they really want to help. They seem to criticize how the work is being done.
bad,The management with in the company does not communicate with the employees. Training left a lot to be desired. Training at the location I was at was more like the feeling of sink or swim
bad,I hated working on the phones. You are completely stuck to your desk and it makes it hard to make any relationships with the people you work with. The work atmosphere was awful.
bad,"It pays the bills but drains your motivation. If you work in collections, its very stressful and you feel there's no support from management in fixing the issues customers are upset about."
bad,Management was very difficult. The work life balance was non-existent. Upper management wanted managers to be in the branch from open to close everyday.
bad,"Took this job years ago for a bump in pay. Environment was beyond pushy for sales, unethical, high pressure to sell to customers who had no need for product, ritually called on the carpet for not producing, asked to stay late 1-2 nights per week to make 100-200 mandatory cold-calls to customers, no sense of customer service, management made mega bucks and did very little work."
bad,"Wells Fargo is not a great company to work for. Workday starts with conference calls, several, then staff meeting to discuss conference calls. Office was never staffed. hardest part of the job was working for a company with no compassion for customers or employees and suppressed professional ethics."
bad,"Stressful environment with emphasis on being #1 loan center in the nation, which did not prove as a positive in keeping our loan center open.  Sadly, Wells Fargo closed our loan center.  Great team members and support with the team to overcome the stressful environment in the drive to be number one.  Multiple audits and negative feedback from management on a daily basis due to the federal scrutiny Wells Fargo was and still is undergoing.  I still love the review and underwriting of loans with the end result of providing a customer with a new home, which is exciting, exhilarating and very satisfying.  Great team of co-workers, with excellent support and good relationships built through the strength and development of lasting friendships."
bad,I wouldn’t work for Wells Fargo again. Little to No room for career advancement. Good pay the job is easy but can be a bit stressful when handling and counting customers money all day. Balancing at the end of the day is VERY IMPORTANT. Higher ups and management do not care about the little people. The Policy that is up to date makes it easy for Tellers to get fired!
bad,"Wells Fargo being in the spotlight these past couple years has really changed the workplace negatively. From what I've witnessed the company is very reactive and changes things AFTER the company has messed up, and even they don't make the correct changes. Upper management does not listen to their employees, and I think they'd be much better off if they did."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,No information and we should not be required to detail information that we may or may not wish to disclose. I worked in various locations in the Charlotte region.
bad,WF is a big company and it's goal is to minimize employment. Please be prepared for a tumultuous environment. You work there with the stress of losing your job at any moment.
bad,Didnt work here long enough to get a feel for these kinds of details.It was a typical office setting and I wasn't involved in much but getting my work done and clocking out.
bad,"Alot of pressure with sales and selling checking accounts. "
bad,"Did not have a great experience there. Was hamstrung by intra-department politics with no support from my manager. Difficult to have influence as a contractor, which is necessary to succeed in the BSC role. I was told I was empowered to make own decisions but it seems doing so led to my dismissal. I did not receive any feedback from the hiring manager prior to being let go, or after by the staffing agency that employed me so I cannot say for certain."
bad,"at one point was the best job i ever had , but management change ended all that. i was forced to sale products people didnt need causing them to overdraft and have bad standing with wells fargo."
bad,"I started out working for Wachovia Bank which was known and revered for the Service it Provided. Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia after the housing market crash. The Corporate Culture changed over time from less service to more of a sales driven Institution. Many employees that were from Wachovia shortly left, or were let go. Work became more and more about making the company money, and serving it's bottom line than for serving the members of the bank. I expressed my feelings, and concerns to my immediate supervisor. This was a Woman I knew and had work with for several years. I was told  ""That Wells Fargo was a Sales Driven Company, and no longer a Service driven company. I have always lived and worked by the belief that If you provide Exceptional Customer Service, and do Right by your Customer. The Customer will do right, and take care of you. I loved what I did until I could not take it any more. I was deflated that day in the office of my supervisor. I went back to my desk, and with a heavy heart wrote my letter of resignation. I stayed on for a month "
bad,"Company used to be a good place to work, however, has changed drastically in the last 2 years.  Recorded calls, scripting for phone conversations, bonus structure has changed for the worse."
bad,"I worked at Wells Fargo and was able to study and obtain the Series 7 and Series 66. I enjoy helping clients achieve their financial goals. I worked with one broker and provided client support. I also did marketing, prospecting, client seminars and helped with portfolio construction."
bad,"Micromanagement along with horrible compensation. It would not matter what you received on your quarterly/yearly reviews, you would still get the same 1-2% raise. I received 4 and 5 every year for 12 years and never once received over a 3% raise. That being said, the CEO and upper level management revived millions of dollars in bonuses each year. Money hungry company that cares nothing for the employees compensationswise."
bad,"I did learn to be a teller at Wells Fargo, which may help me if I wanted to get a personal banker job, but in general, at my branch, there was tons of pressure to sell and perform perfectly. The customer service manager, who is the teller's boss, definitely played favorites and watched me for every little mistake. I loved the customer though!"
bad,"Most know why Wells Fargo employees will give a bad review during a certain span of years...outrageous sales goals that were absolutely unobtainable ethically, and consequences when/if you did not reach those goals. The pressure and stress was unlike any I had ever encountered in a workplace."
bad,"Although I was hired as a Business Analyst to produce API build documentation, track tasks, and facilitate project progression, my manager has been assigning me to write training materials since I started 4 months ago. I directly confronted her about deviating from the contractually agreed upon job description and requested that I get more BA/API work. I was speciously appeased with a project no one was working or proceeding while still being requested to write more training materials. I escalated the complaint and was met with undiplomatic indiscretion. Empirical support of misconduct within management is ignored and escalations are forcibly suppressed. Clearly politics and hierarchy are more important than a healthy and productive work environment."
bad,Complete Chaos.  Current events and seemingly random changes in orgs and management have lead to confusion and an overall lack of trust.  There seems like there's no real strategy to deal with the numerous issues that have come to light over the past 3 years.
bad,"Great training, great team and family environment.  No job is secure.. layoffs every two to three years.    High demands, low pay."
bad,"Each individual has their own experience.  I wasn't impressed with management decisions at the C-Level.  They did't take ownership of mistakes they made rather the ""buck"" was passed along to lower level employees to take the brunt of customer dissatisfaction with internal bad decision making.   Loss of revenue meant cut-backs and the most hit were lower level employees, CEO, CFO musical chairs swapping was ridiculous to see, board members need to take swift action and replace C-Level management."
bad,"A typical work day is about 11 hours (8:30-7:30) and its tough work.  Long hours were not the issue though, the divisive, combative and emphatically self-centered employees were.  It makes sense to look out for yourself but when even the smallest of favors are met with contempt its hard not to notice how far beyond the standard capitalist ""me first"" attitude they've gone.  Wells advertises ""together we'll go far"" but the division I worked in within the bank could not have been more of the antithesis.  With the exception of a handful of colleagues, I felt as though I was constantly fighting against the immediate and extended team before I even got to do the job that I was hired to do.  This job is not for the faint of heart."
bad,Not a great place to work. Good benefits but lots and lots of pressure to perform. Wanted quantity over quality.  Managers don't help their staff advance.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"If you don't mind working 50+ hours per week with little or no job training, this is the place for you. Wells Fargo is still run by the good ole boys who work less than 40 hours per week as they push their job duties down on their employees.  Their computer systems are from the stone age."
bad,"The training at Wells Fargo is decent, however, they lack communication amongst each other within management. They tell you one thing in the interview, but once you accept the job, things are totally different and they do not keep their word. I was upfront with them in the interview that I am a student in the evening, and have to take classes after 5pm, they still wouldn't offer any flexibility around that schedule.  If you have a growth mindset, and want to achieve your maximum potential, stay away from Wells Fargo Dealer Services. They tell you one thing but do the totally opposite each day. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here unless you just need a job, not a career. They will constantly sell you false dreams."
bad,Wells Fargo demands all work entered with no mistakes and no training if you make a mistake. Management will not work with you. The hardest part of the job is that they will change the way work is processed daily and expect you to remember it.
bad,"If you are over 35 -40 you will not be appreciated by WF and will not be able to advance, if restarting your career.  this company does not utilize the experience of it staff.  if you are not 30 something you don't fit in"
bad,Supervision was horrible. Proper coaching was not provided and management style was micromanaging. Was forced to sell products unethically. Manager would force employees when to go to lunch versus letting them figure it out
bad,Most everything doing with the bank and my goals was truly out of my hands.  I was promised retail originations but expected to create my own referral sources instead.  The culture was difficult to work in as their was very little management guidance and too much training that didn't relate to the job. I left after realizing the bank's moral compass was pointing in the wrong direction.
bad,"Did this as a contract position. It is very difficult to get hired full time with Wells Fargo and I knew this was only going to be a 6 month stint at most, I took the job while looking for something more permanent."
bad,"There is room to make money if you are very competitive, however overall Wells Fargo doesn't really care about their employees nor customers, it's all about their money."
bad,Management was not as it should have been. My branch was constantly short-staffed.That situation makes it very difficult to give good customer service and remain accurate with all the tedious tasks at hand. Most of the co-workers were great.
bad,"When I started at Wells Fargo almost 7 years ago it was a great company to work for. Unfortunately, all the negative press and scandals have not only hurt the company, but the stress has been passed down to low level employees who had nothing to do with the issues. The culture shift has been a shock. I no longer feel appreciated in the slightest. They do not take into account anything team members have to say. "
bad,"Mostly data entry all day long. It was okay, keyed in checks / mostly focused on numbers. Long hours, worked until the work was complete. Able to leave early if job was complete"
bad,Thought I would be here forever but I am unable to relocate and getting laid off.  Have worked here for 3 years.  Very unfortunate time of my life.  I wont be able to find some place in my location with as great of benefits and pay especially since im not done with my college degree yet.
bad,"Working at wells fargo was a little rough, it was a highly stressful job due to the sales system that they imposed, pay was good, but the whole company itself needed an arrangement in system."
bad,"I want to say I love Wells Fargo. The benefits are great and the PTO is awesome. However, the company is constantly finding ways to not pay their employees. Tenor means nothing and bonus structure is changed every year but not rolled out until you are 4 months in and it's almost too late to recover. For Home Equity- Bonuses used to be monthly. management tries to cover up and smooth things over and are never upfront with employees. When we went from monthly incentives we were told that our new comp plan was even better.. when in reality you are going from taking an extra $400 a month home and 1300-1400 a quarter to about 1200 a year. MAYBE. No promotional opportunities, review for raises are a joke and about once a year based on statics that are designed to screw you over.  Unfortunately this company is all in who you know and who brown noses the management best."
bad,High energized environment. Company allows you to help people with their finances and give sound financial advice. Company is changing to adjust to recent challenges that they have faced to create a better culture.
bad,"Over all wells Fargo is a good company, I would never work for this particular department again. I worked in the retirement department and the over all experience was poor. Management was always on you about not being on the phones even when you have to use the restroom. Overtime was barley there unless it was mandatory and that was only an hour."
bad,"Myself I am creative individual who needs to be somewhere other than a desk all day long. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Very disorganized. Intensive training for 1 week then sat around for almost 4 weeks waiting for system access. Not much support from the micro-manager, she knew less than I did. Very unprofessional manager."
bad,"Mortgage Lenders, pre-foreclosure, Foreclosure, home preservation options, default reasoning, and how to sit on a phone for 8 hours a day saying the same thing over and over again."
bad,"Depending on work load; a typical day at work would be some what busy"
bad,"I joined thinking wells fargo was a leader in the mortgage industry, but not in my area. We only had one bank in our city and one mortgage office. It was around the time where wells fargo was caught in the scandal of fake accounts. Even though it was no directed towards mortgage, it still was seen as a negative. Also they are too strict or scared with their loan process, which made it difficult to originate loans."
bad,"wellsfargo only interest is sales, sales, sales, not the customer. I really felt bad everyday after work because i felt i didn't help or solve the customers issues because i was forced to up sale."
bad,"The company turns and burns employees, especially managers. It is a very cut throat environment and they constantly dealing with lawsuits that requires them to change banking policy often."
bad,When they hire you it's all about caring. And then it turns out to be all about numbers and meeting goals. It's the worst. Expectations are often unrealistically high with little to no exception time granted for situations that are beyond the collectors control -- such as fires.
bad,"No wonder one reads bad news about the company.  While they blame the low level employees, the fish always stinks from the head.  Senior management sets way too ambitious plans to grow the company which means at this size (265,000+ employees and high market share in the saturated financial market place) that the goals are unachievable.  In turn senior management pushed lower managers and employees to the max.  Most lower level positions require over 60 hours of work, and one year's high achievement is next year's base line."
bad,"I worked my way up from teller to Personal banker, at the time my manager was wonderful.  When she left, the manager who took her place was awful.  She  embraced employees who made huge numbers, although they were opening accounts customers did not know about.  One of the bankers I worked with witnessed a banker forging loan docs, when management became aware, instead of terminating the employee, in the wrong, right away, they tried to figure a way to terminate the employee who reported this, eventually the employee was terminated.  I resigned a short time after this occurance knowing eventually they would try to fire the honest employees."
bad,I am one that is working to be debt free and they are ones that go for putting people into debt. For that their philosophy is one that I don't agree with.
bad,"high paced call environment."
bad,"Imagine making a company millions of dollars only to receive a $600 bonus check. "
bad,Employees lack motivation not committed to quality work. They will work when the management is there but will not work when management is not there...
bad,Before sales scandals it was an awful place to work. Constant pressure from managers to make daily sales goals. After scandals it was much easier. Wells is still dealing with backlash from all the fake accounts.
bad,not a very fun workplace. I learned more about customer service and how to interact with people better! management was decent. Workplace culture was very diverse which is a amazing thing. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers money but also having to be fast.
bad,"Learned very well within. But the Schedule arrangements of time off were strict and often unavailable."
bad,"Not enough learning opportunities. Fewer full time employees. Mostly contractors are hired. Fewer training opportunities available."
bad,"they promote a great work culture, its not that great, the job closed down, will tell you many things that never come true. they say they will promote within but many have been promoted from outside."
bad,"Pay and benefits are fine.  However you will take a lot of abuse from customers and have very little time off the phone. Nothing fun about this job. Also, very few opportunities for advancement, despite what recruiter will tell you."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Management needed more education. Mandatory overtime was required even if it did not work with your home schedule. Many times workdays were stressful when the company was needing to make cuts.
bad,"Constant changes with little management to help, great team to work with and people are friendly. Hardest part of job is how much favoritism will help you succeed. If your upper management does not like you chances to move up are limited."
bad,Stringent deadlines require sacrifices to family life. Requires on call 24/7 and responses to leadership in minutes. micromanagement is always performed and continual change too the process make the duties unpredictable.
bad,It was ok but stressful as well based on collection standards and other metrics that sometimes were hard to keep up with depending on the call volume on given days.
bad,Doing home modifications for current wells fargo customers....  Had to deal with customer in very bad financial situations to prevent people from losing there homes
bad,This company was fast paced. Good location if you lived in Milwaukee or surrounding area. Company also offered bonuses based on individual performance.
bad,"Culture was awesome - I had great teammates.  Outside of that, I didn't see much to be desired.  It was time for me to move on and I chose an entirely new career to accomplish that."
bad,"Not much room for advancement in this area. The workplace is extremely dusty, low pay for a lot of work, expectations to finish batches are very hard-the average American will not enjoy this, hence they employ lots of minorities."
bad,A great company to work for the company formally named wachovia / first union.   The benefits were great it was so much you can learn and grow at this company the staff was pleasant to work with.
bad,"A lot of false promises at Wells Fargo, there is limited growth with the company due to the sales scandal and remodeling management has done since it."
bad,"Long work hours, focus is primarily on production and not on customer satisfaction. Wells Fargo does not care about their customers or employees. The hardest part of the job is working 12 to 13 hour days and not being able to balance work and personal life."
bad,"During my time with Wells Fargo I went through many different managers and district managers because of the lack of support from upper management. There was no consistency with what's expected, one minute it's SALE SALE SALE, then the next it's all about customer service. They want the staff to be a family but there is a clear separation between the platform side, bankers, and the service side, tellers. No manager seems to be able to bring a cohesive team environment and causes unnecessary disruptions between the team. Once the management changed again, they started bringing in ""their"" people and removing others. One of my managers was pushed out so our DM can bring his wife down to manage the store. Other than the pay, I wouldn't have stayed as long as I did."
bad,Wells Fargo is loosing a lot of good employees due to poor management. Culture is ok depending on management. Not a banking job but customer service job.
bad,the lockbox department can be stressful and the standards are sometimes set to high. The management team needs to go back through training. Long hours
bad,Can be a very stressful and hostile environment. Its a production department and the production standards  can sometimes be set to high for the actual reality of meeting those standards.
bad,"My company was acquired by Wells Fargo. After the acquisition, the culture changed dramatically especially since the financial scandal of 2015.  Since 2015 the company became more focused on making money than valuing its employees.  Sad situation since many great people left the company due to the poor work environment."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Stressful environment due to poor management and lack if structure in the branch where I was employed. Also other unaddressed problems within the branch that management wouldn't take care of. Unhealthy to work in. Became stressful for my work and my home life.
bad,"Wells Fargo is not a good work environment. Competition for sales is so high that there is little to no team camaraderie. While the company claims to be all about customer service, it is mostly focused on pushing more and more unneeded products on its customers."
bad,Management frequently intentionally misleads staff about the companies direction and often looks to make money at the expense of its customers and employees.
bad,Currently the company has high goals that are impossible to meet. Training is very poor it seems that the management staff just needs a body to man the phone regardless if you understand your job's role
bad,"As a current employee, the department I work in is a very stressful and difficult place to work. Over worked with no balance, the environment has become toxic and negative. While employees tend to like each other and get along, NONE of us are happy with where we work and are constantly looking for ways to tolerate it."
bad,"A typical day at work is spent training new hires or team members who have advanced to a higher skill level.  When not training, hours are spent on prepping for the next class or working on assigned projects.  Salary levels are not equitable to other financial institutions and there is not a clear cut path for growth.  If you want to move into a senior role, you have to wait until one opens, you can't be promoted solely based on performance.  The hardest part of the job is seeing highly qualified people leave because they are tired of waiting to move up and/or found another position that pays much better.  The most enjoyable part of the job are my team mates."
bad,"a typical day at work when I go to work full of energy and motivation to help customers  with their financial needs and when I reach my goal as far as numbers, I learned a lot when it comes to help customers with their financial lives and how we can have them succeed financially. as far as management I also learned how to drive my self to achieve my goals as team or individually, work place culture was busy all the day helping verity of Arabic customers the most and that when my Arabic language skills come in to play. the hardest part of the job actually I enjoyed  helping my customers and give them the right solutions and that when I make them happy and satisfied about the service or the product they got, the most enjoyable part of the job when we help each other to win as a team."
bad,"they are more concerned with their bottom line than with their employees, as a employee you would come after the customer and unless you were in management you were just another person who worked for them and they had no issue just replacing you and didnt make that a secret"
bad,Wells Fargo is a learning opportunity for those interested in sales. Working for a large bank certainly opens doors and presents many opportunities for networking.
bad,Employees are expected to pitch new financial plans to all inbound calls from account holders seeking assistance with making mortgage payments. Upper management focusing soly on numbers of calls resulting in new financial contracts with customers instead of evaluating call for quality customer service. Pressured to meet monthly quota to avoid termination.
bad,Not strong culture of integrating WFIS with bank.WFIS mid-management team lacks leadership qualities. Lack of industry specific depth.
bad,"Great job with awesome benefits and hourly pay is great as well BUT.... your job security is really something to worry about which also plays apart in job management... Managers will make you feel like your job is secure and even try to help you move to another department but don't let one thing go wrong they will smile in your face and the next day walk you out the building. They have two training classes EVERY month because they let go of so many people! You may only have the same manager for about 6 months and your team leads will change every two months it seem.. Just to provide more information on the position im referring to its Phone Banker at the Charlotte location."
bad,Good job security with a chance for a slow career progression. You are mandated to stay at your current role for a year even if you are a top performer. The company went through some heavy attacks in the media which made them change their culture a little bit. Decent 401k though
bad,"Unless you like working in a cubicle or dealing with angry customer's all day, I would suggest working for another company that is not currently tainted by their reputation."
bad,Not a good career decision.Staffing was not consistent with educational and professional experience. Made for a bad experience for those with true career aspirations.
bad,"As a contractor, I can not give this company an A, but I had meet a few nice hard coworkers."
bad,"Wachovia moved its underwriting division from Reading, Pa to Birmingham, AL. They found that rent was cheaper and wages were less down south. Over 150 people in Reading were laid off."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,The training is horrible. two months training with multiple instructors that are not even sure what they are teaching them self's. The rules are constantly changing  and you do not get notified until later. the quality expectations are unreal. The people who are hired by the company hate working there and always seem miserable and there turn over is ridiculous people do not make it through training most of the time
bad,"Working at Wells Fargo is a challenge. The work environment is not very friendly and highly competitive. There is a constant push to sell, regardless if the customer needs or wants the products they are pushing.The plus side is there is ample room to sell and make bonuses on top of your base salary."
bad,Coworkers are enjoyable for the most part. You will enjoy having your own office but the nature of the job can be annoying when people do not show up for appointments.
bad,"A good company to work for. Good pay. A banking culture similar to any big bank.  A friendly environment, with the ability to advance with hard work."
bad,No Privacy in cubic workspaces where they want you to talk about credit and brokerage. Everyone hears everyone else's private information.
bad,"This company truly only cares about making more money. They say it's all about the customer, but really it's all about how much money you can make off a customer. You are required to sell, sell, sell! Not have a relationship with each customer and make them feel comfortable with their money being at your bank."
bad,"Wells fargo great benefits, little pay for sales goals you must hit. If you are promise an promotion within the company be prepare to be lie to.I was told thats a regularly thing at wells fargo."
bad,Unrealistic production rates expected to be met.  In depth training not provided thus leading to incompetent and unethical practices that negatively effected a number of clients.
bad,"you hit your ceiling very early. you're either managing a team or your a team member. but it is  not a fun environment to be in. there is a lot of favoritism throughout the company, I have been in 5 different departments and there is no room for growth unless you want to be in management, and not all people are fit to be in that category."
bad,"Easy job overall, I learned so much about the banking industry and what goes on behind the scenes other than being able to check accounts online. Management was an absolute mess, they couldn't seem to keep any of their employees. The employees that have been there for years did not seem to take new management seriously. The hardest part was constantly having a manager behind the teller line that did not trust their employees. It made it a very uncomfortable environment."
bad,"I would come into work and start to review titles for mortgages.  It was very unorganized.  I was only a temporary employee with opportunity for permanent hire, but EVERYONE was laid off."
bad,When you make it past the first five years you can coast to retirement if you keep your head down and worship the ground management walks over.
bad,Liked working here but very strict standards and do not take slack in the company. Like the people I worked with at Wells Fargo.
bad,I want to get a job at a company where I can get advancement and have the ability to better myself in life. I do not get that at here.
bad,"Great place to work, overtime when you  need it. The people are great. The did a great job training me and guiding me when i had questions."
bad,There was no sales training prior to being required to meet and exceed sales goals. Management was inconsistent and often absent.
bad,"I was one of the best loan officers and personal banker here at wellsfargo, I wanted to do more than sell, i wanted to build relaitonshiop"
bad,"Answering phones to assist customers with Finance needs"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Inbound/outbound call center for mortgage and loss mitigation department. Put customers on payment plans, take payments, modify loans and inform customers of foreclosure procedures."
bad,"It was my experience that the ""best and brightest"" will become bored and seek new challenges outside of Wells Fargo due to lack of career advancement opportunities.  Those happy with the status quo will remain and be promoted, but not before someone in upper management is terminated, resigns, or retires.  This was usually the catalyst for promotions during my eight years working for Wells Fargo.   Also, for it to be a bank, ""money"" was a dirty word when it came to discussions of compensation and bonuses.  Go figure."
bad,"It is difficult to find any meaningful relationship beyond the office.  The management is disengaged.  The opportunity to build a client base is not there for new comers, as is true with most places you may land."
bad,the company has great benefits. the vacation time is great. the company has a lot of turnover. it is also very hard to advance with the company. my coworkers are like family.
bad,"Wells Fargo provides a great training launch pad. On the job performance is all based on sales. The training vested on you no longer applies while on the job. Your personal education, ethics, professionalism, and etiquette will not suffice in this environment. Do not invest time in building relationships with your customers or clients. At the end of the day, management will be hounding you for your numbers that day."
bad,You go into this job not really knowing how sales obsessed they are. You are required to meet sales requirement every quarter (even just as a teller) and the managers and bankers ride your back to try and get you to make sales. Your best is never good enough and you are ALWAYS stressed. The stress and headache is not worth it AT ALL.
bad,"Too micromanagement and lack of flexibility. Management sets employees up for failure with unrealistic guidelines set for call center. No opportunities for minorities in HCE positions. It's more of a job than career, you spend years in a low to mid position if your a minority regardless of your education and employment experience."
bad,Company could focus more on client needs instead of product pushing. Company has great tradition and cares about there image.
bad,ok job cant make a living out of. great working staff just horrible pay. wouldnt recommend if you trying to make a living.
bad,I enjoyed working with and helping new and existing customers manage their accounts as well as troubleshooting and assisting customers with technical online issues.
bad,"Working at Wells Fargo was nice as a student, since a worked a swing shift from 1pm-10pm. It allowed me to go to school in the morning and work at night. The call center life was too monotonous and in the year that I worked there, the only raise I received was a ""Cost of Living"" raise. Co workers were great, upward movement is not really attainable unless you are favored by upper management or supervisors.They also promote ""soft selling"" but you can un-sell yourself out of a job."
bad,"In this job I learned adamant customer service skills, time management, and excellent social development. "
bad,Not a company that cares for its employees.  Financials and pleasing external clients are more important than the internal clients and culture.  I have worked for several companies and never seen more disgruntled employees than within this company.  Some persons have been with the firm over 20 years and are not in any form of leadership so the firm is ok with you becoming complacent.  High turn over and lower salaries compared to other financial institutions including those this company merged with.  This is not a place that works in a logical manner.  Also never feel like employees are treated as adults.  Very unfortunate because they make the atmosphere more hostile than it has to be.
bad,"Wachovia was bought out by Wells Fargo in 2009. Prior to that it was a great place to work. After it was bought, about half of the people in my office were laid off."
bad,"I worked here as a contractor and learned very quickly that contractors are treated like outcasts at Wells Fargo. No benefits or perks whatsoever. You are not allowed at the holiday party or any other company events like White Elephant etc. You have to pay for your food at team lunches (this goes for FTEs as well). Compensation is not very competitive. Technology is not very modern. FTEs get a cubicle to themselves while contractors must share a cubicle. Co-workers, for the most part, did not take the time to get to know you on a personal level."
bad,"When you first get hired they stress Customer Service not so much the sales side. Once you graduate to the ""floor"" you expected to sell or refer products/services to customers regardless of the need or not. They only care about the Sale Goals everything else comes second. Hardest part of the job is meeting Sales Goals and handling customer calls in a timely manner. Customers are always angry when they call in because of Wells Fargo policy or receiving wrong information from the branch locations. Customers will also be charged a fee for just about everything and Wells Fargo will refuse to reimburse any fee to help customers out. Managers will belittle you in team meetings and in individual meetings. There is plenty of support in the Coaching team but once you fail to meet numbers week after week, This company will chase you out. There is also no days off and if you request a day off you will be wait listed and eventually rejected that day. So when you take it anyway you will receive a occurrence. Also there's no time for bathroom breaks as those are frowned upon because they affect you work time on the phone."
bad,"In a word: waste. There is a lot of inefficiency and waste going on there. I was tasked with doing the same thing, then told to redo it three times. Many times I would have nothing to do and I would be told 'oh okay, just go read a book and wait' which is fine if they want me to sit around and get paid for that, but I thought I could be put to better use in some way. "
bad,Great benefits but poor management and very high turnover.  They are very high pressure and demanding but offer little or no motivation other than threatening your job.
bad,"This is a very sales driven environment, with very little appreciation for customer service, even though that is what they market. The management is interested in ""what have you done for me lately"" rather than the overall production and value you bring to the company. Very stressful, and not a happy working environment."
bad,"Great benefits, co-workers. My specific position had no procedure or official training. Unapproachable management."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Co workers were amazing. Keep in mind that this job is intended more for college students, and not for adults with bill to pay."
bad,"it was very stressful because they would make you hit certain goals were almost impossible to reach and pick on you all day long to reach those goals It did not matter for them if you were the best employee if you do not meet the goals you are fired . I was their one of the best employee ever for 5 years, received star performance award and many more rewards and incentive from Wells Fargo. Management very inexperience, micro management. I did my job everyday and tried to enjoy it.Other employees were very nice but because of incentives and goals it was stressful everyone is trying to keep their job and scared that they were not going to reach their goals. I have a lot of experience in banking fifteen years. I must have taken every class and training in banking plus I was hospitality oriented person since I was in hotel business over twenty years I know very well how to handle customers and their problems. I did just about everything every position you can imagine in retail banking."
bad,A poor corporate environment that does not provide for innovative ideas or doing what is best for the customer.  Handcuffed to meaningless quotas and bogged down by non income producing paperwork that yields no real value.  Poor accountability in the company.
bad,Management will say one thing to the staff and do something contrary.  It is about who you know vs. what you know in keeping or obtaining a management position. They will hire someone even though they don't meet the minimum requirements.  Old boy system.
bad,"cssr customer service, cash handling, opening, closing ans servicing accounts"
bad,"only allowed approx 3 mins to assist customers with their needs, however can make them hold for as long as it takes for a sales rep. have held for 30 mins or longer, and that time goes against your numbers."
bad,Did not enjoy working there - unorganized.  Work volume was very high and expectations were sometimes unreachable.
bad,The office culture is highly stressful which I was used to in the mortgage industry for over 10 years. However it was exasperated by the management style which was not cohesive or responsive to issues when presented by staff. The most enjoyable part of working there was benefits as far as  healthcare ( which was of course increasing every year) and the  co-workers. The team environment was truly that when it came to the staff.
bad,Hardest sales goal I have ever faced. Micromanagement is terrible. Managers care only about 5 referrals per day and meeting their goals.Very stressful job and no work-life balance. Co-workers are nice. Very competitive environment but if you meet your goals it is not too bad.
bad,"Handle daily pipeline of homeowners looking to be reviewed for a loan modification. Verbal and Written Correspondence to homeowner to assist through process. Used various internal databases. "
bad,"This branch is a world all its own with the added value *cough* of the Wells Fargo culture. You will enjoy your friendship with other tellers, and A FEW customers. You will be required to ""sell"" regardless of the benefit/consequence of the customer."
bad,"Plenty of opportunity to move departments."
bad,"Company all about money now instead of customer's service. Some managers not going by company's policy and guild lines. Employee's getting lay off their job for no reasons because the have employment at will in their hiring process, I will take Wachovia any day over this new Wells Fargo company."
bad,"Wells Fargo Bank-Credit Card Support "
bad,"Wells Fargo was fun and fulfilling at times. I definitely did learn a lot about the banking industry. The management at the time wasn't the best. My co-workers were the best, they made everyday at work fun. The hardest part of the job was the pressure to ""sell the bankers"" and the umbrella of products. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the chance to help people."
bad,like the boiler room for banks if youre in the retail channel
bad,"upon request. good company very poor management. "
bad,"This may be a normal corporation environment and I was just not well suited for it.  The hardest part of the job is learning the job through being punished for mistakes instead of being trained to complete it properly.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the team members are really nice to work with and the benefits are good."
bad,A typical day at Wells Fargo is that I have to auto in for the day to receive inbound calls from customers if their single point of contact is not available. We have huddles daily to go over with the team new processes or how to proceed with a process. I call out to my borrowers or customers on my pipeline that I have over 100. I have to monitor for either documents to be reviewed for a modification if experiencing hardship and can't afford the payments. If file is approved then I monitor file to make sure they make a payment each month for the trial plan that lasts for 3 months. I call out to my files that are also going through and trying to sell their house as well. I review documents as well through out the day to verify if received all the information and correct documents to go through review.
bad,I was with Wells for about 7 years and enjoyed most of my time but really struggled with how much selling they required.  I saw many managers make unethical decisions to get ahead and some of them now have big regional jobs.  I would not work for them again given the opportunity.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Goals are one thing. Goals determined and implemented by management that has zero connection to the front line is ludicrous. If you've seen Undercover Boss you know how often this is the case (nearly always) but Hades will freeze before the multi-million-dollar man visits one of his branches. "
bad,It focuses on high pressure sales and sales goals. If you do not meet your sales goals you could be fired. There was a great deal of favoritism amongst the managers and the district managers. You can get promoted easily if you are very good friends with management but not if you actually work hard and do a good job. I would recommend this as a job while you're working your way through college; definitely not as a career.
bad,The benefits are good and the people are very helpful.The company is a good company to work for.
bad,"Coming into this position I knew it was a production assignment. What I did not know until after the fact was the qouta system they have with it. Upon my interview I was told for example If I had to retrieve 90 files in a day then I would be shown how to do that and would know where to go. Assuming that's what I would need to retrieve roughly 90 files a day. Coming to the actual job it is 350 files. Was hard to get that qouta at first but eventually got there and then found it easier because was getting used to it. My biggest trouble was putting files back on the shelf. Now we were asked to take 350 files pulled per day. I now 'am asked to put away 503 files back to shelf in 3 hours. "
bad,Online customer service representative consistently meeting all compliance and demonstrate knowledge of financial services to help customers succeed financially.
bad,Lots of turnover and not a lot of advancement potential. You will become good at sales or sink quickly.
bad,"Everyday I work with customers to help them be more financially successful through recommending certain accounts and general financial advice. I have learned how to talk to people about finances in a way everyone can understand. Although the job in itself is rewarding; current management makes it difficult to enjoy the job. The sales goals are unrealistic and the current Manager is not afraid to belittle employees in public.  My coworkers are very helpful and work well together, which makes the job easier."
bad,Must have experience in the insurance business to understand their terms and policy procedures.  Very different from the industry I had come from.  Very rapid atmosphere and goal deadlines.  Could not keep up with their pace due to my lack of knowledge in the industry.  Parting was mutual that it was the wrong job for someone with my background.
bad,"maintenance/open-close accounts"
bad,Great team atmosphere but too much sales for a bank teller and banker. More about sales rather than customer service.
bad,"I am usually a very upbeat and positive person however, I have watched the Frederick Maryland site lose over half of its workforce due to employees leaving on their accord or management creating chaos by terminating/laying off great employees.  The once manageable work load has tripled in the past three months to unmanageable levels.  It is not unusual but the norm to work through breaks and lunch.  It is also not unusual to list on ones time tracker/time card that you took your much needed lunch break when you actually did not!  In fact, this practice is pushed by many managers/supervisors verbally and in instant messages.  "
bad,"Enjoyed working for a well rounded person, enjoyed my co-workers and enviroment. Just wish that company stayed the same"
bad,Be prepared to sell everything under the sun including your soul.
bad,"This job focus more on sales than employess, the only way for promotion is to get high sales goals and not focus so much on customer interaction."
bad,A typical day consisted of helping customers with opening and maintaining new banking accounts. I learned how to be competitive in the retail banking environment. I developed great relationships with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was staying competitive with other banks and the products they offered. The most enjoyable part of the job was the face-to-face interaction with the customers.
bad,My typical day at work is read your emails make sure of any changes or updates if any changes learned what is expected of me.  Manage the daily calls by using the metrics.  The hardest part of the job not being able to give a credit and have to say no to the customer.  The most enjoyable part of the job is team mates make the day go by faster and easier.
bad,I enjoyed the culture. I also liked my work hours. I love my team members.
bad,"Not the best paying but good job to go to school with, not very many opportunity to grow where I live"
bad,"I worked for wells fargo in two major capacities. The first was as a branch manager for their finance company for close to ten years(no longer in existence). Second I worked as an underwriter (2 yrs). "
bad,"Personal banker is an aggressive sales position. Managers will talk about ""perception"" there is not as much grey area as people try to create. At the end of the day you need to do what is best for your customer, not your bonus check."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Not good pay for the responsibility with access to large sums of money.  Pay level barely above minimum wage even for senior level bank tellers with higher responsibility rolls.
bad,This job is all about what you can get away with.  I really don't believe they care about customers in the end.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of being punctual, reviewing and paying of invoices.  I was busy at all times and had to learn new systems with no training when Wells Fargo took over which was the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being busy, which is something that I like about working."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of completing 3-5 underwrites.  I was able to sharlen my underwriting skills.  Management was constantly wanting more production no matter how hard you worked or how much time you put in.  Co workers were awesome, met a lot of great friends.  The hardest part of the job was learning Wells Fargos DOS based system(non point and click).  The most enjoyable part of the job was my days off."
bad,I have nothing good to say about this company. They offer a two week training class that turned out to be nothing but a waste of time. The managers offered very little in the way of assistance. The people there divide into clicks and judge long before they get to know you. The worst work experience of my life.
bad,A typical day at work consist of making outbound/inbound collection calls regarding customers home equity accounts.
bad,"Worked in the Equity division and was very disappointed. I have over 10 years experience in the mortgage industry and have never experienced such a convoluted way of processing/underwriting a loan as they utilize. "
bad,"It's a great job for a high school student or someone without a college degree. It's a horrible job if you have a college degree, because of pay and how long it would take to get a promotion. "
bad,"They tell you the hours that you are supposed to work (8-5 am), but then drop it on you at the end of the day that you need to work until 7 pm.  I am a mom, and I can't do that with a child in daycare."
bad,"I had two service managers.  They did not help at all when I came to the branch to train. I was told in training that my service manager would stay by my side for atleast two weeks. It was more like never and I had two service managers, no excuse! I was put with a lead teller, who at the time had been there 15 years and was mad. Because the company was merging into another company which sent her to the teller-line. Alot of the information she would tell me was incorrect, as if she was trying to do it on purpose. There excuse was that they were short on help and didn't have the time. But they had time to gossip to one another about people. Before I went to work there people were saying they were not friendly. While I worked there customers would say they don't keep nobody long, especially the most friendly ones.  Hmm... Something's up with that. Even customers notice before I had a chance to learn. The two service managers and the lead teller need to be replaced! ASAP!"
bad,"Wells Fargo has a good ethic program they preach to all employees when they are hired, but when you are put into the real work, they want you to bend those ethics to the point where you are unsure if what you are doing is right for profit. They will preach that isn't true, but when it comes to your output and giving the customer truly what they need there is a huge gray area is many managers, regional managers, & executives minds. There are good people here too just like most companies, but if you want to advance fast, you have to bend those ethics, and that was something I was not willing to do, the Bonus structure is constantly changed to make it more and more difficult to earn more compensation, and it is a what have you done for me lately work place. They have the right mentality or what should be great in a financial institution but, implement it poorly and it shows in their customer service, and the average employee. "
bad,"Severely understaffed and overworked IT department, poor compensation, counter productive non-negotiable internal policies"
bad,It's great if you love being micromanaged and constantly demoralized.
bad,"Enjoyable people to work with but the work is boring.  Also, Wells Fargo cared more about getting a sale rather than if the sale was really going to help the customer. "
bad,When I first imagined be a banker I thought of relationship building. Since I have been working for Wells Fargo i realized that the position is just all about sales. The company is all about numbers and you will be hounded and micromanaged to reach their goals.
bad,"The turnover is absurd. There is no work-life balance. I not only made my quotas, I exceeded them. Wells Fargo pays better than TD or Bank of America, maybe even PNC, however managers need to only miss their numbers one month to be fired, bankers need to be below their quotas for 3 months to be released. Many bankers left before the three months was up, managers quit before they could be fired, and the smart ones rode out their final paychecks until they were cut loose."
bad,Consistently dealing with lies from other employees to you or to customers. Situation is created by Incentives and Metrics in place encouraging the transfer of customers. Peers were fantastic to work with. Assisted customers in some unique scenarios. Direct Management is great but upper level Management is seemingly detached from issues at hand.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"I started the job and 2 months later got laid off. We had to work for the next few months knowing we would be getting laid off, unless we found another job. A lot of negative feelings in the office, it was tough."
bad,WF hires a slew of people every 6 months just to get the tax incentives and then lays them all off- in 6 months. It's a recurring trend that many are aware of.
bad,It was a professional place but once it was merged with Wachovia everything changed. The company made it harder for its employees to work in a positive environment.
bad,"A typical day as a WF banker is one of pushing financial products to customers and servicing their needs. Typically a sales position with a lot of prestige, but the amount of sales pressure combined with little moral compass makes this position hard to stay in for any length of time if you have any moral fiber. Management was sketchy at best with only performance and standings as their guide at the cost of doing what was right for the customers."
bad,"Just helping customers and meeting quota, I have learned to adapt to change when they converted from Wachovia to Wells Fargo."
bad,It can be a great place to work for if banking is your passion.
bad,Not such a good Company to work at. No team play at this bank. The Coworkers were like children in grade school. I will say never again will I work for them
bad,"Management bases all of how the branch is operated. If the manager wears their emotions on there sleeve, than it is hard to work for. If the manager works like the manager is suppose to do, the branch is an incredible place to work for."
bad,Customers were often signed up for product without their consent through their banker. Many of the customers did not know they were a part of the program until they received bank statements with funds missing. It was difficult to try to retain customers when you know morally the program was not right.
bad,Started work at 3 am ended at 9pm. I learned to be paitent with all different types of people
bad,"Answer questions regarding customers accounts, solve problems, look for products and services that will benefit the customer financially."
bad,Answering escalated calls from consumers and bankers. Learned a great deal about micro management. Company is more concerned about the bottom line than the health of their employees. Consistent reviews and unreachable goals.
bad,"If you like being given goals that increase every time you get close, bonuses that decrease every time you meet them, and cold calling the same customers over and over again, come join the circus!"
bad,Must be good in the sales field. Everything relies on sales.
bad,"I worked at Wells Fargo for about 6 months. The hours were good, the pay was good for what you did. What I didn't like was how sales driven the company is. They claim to be focused on customer service, but all they care about is the all mighty dollar. Unfortunaetly they set high sales goals and the bankers and tellers lied to customers to hit their sales quota so they wouldn't get fired. I witnessed this first hand many many times. I have heard co-workers give customers attitude when they wouldn't agree to open one of their products, and management didn't care. They only cared about customers when they agreed to their products. If you want to lie to people and constantly be stressed about losing your job, then this is the place for you."
bad,The large consumer platform is a benefti for the bank to nature and grow for years to come. The consumer should enjoy the services that will be created based upon the merger wtih Wachovia Bank. The merger between the banks is still in the continuation phases and Wells Fargo believe in micro-management philosophy for their employees.
bad,"I am not sure if I worked for the same company that others that wrote reviews did because my experience is completely different! I worked for First Union, then Wachovia, then Wells Fargo. Once Wells Fargo came in, there was no loyalty what so ever to the tenured employees. When upper management came to tell us we were being displaced, there was absolutely no empathy and we were told ""it is what it is"". There was no assistance in finding another position or even an attempt to look at our department, even though we were far more proficient than the locations that remained open. They do not care about the employees and honestly could care less about the customers either. Unless it comes down to not being able to provide for my family, I will NEVER work for this company again!"
bad,Terrible leadership and culture.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"The work was exciting for the most part, enjoyed the challenges that the business and technology presented, continuously learning."
bad,"Unfortunately, in my department there is a lot of repetition and redundancy.  However, it is necessary and important because it deals with checks written from corporate and individual account holders.  A typical day in this department consists of either separating mail correspondence, readying batches of checks and other documents into the sorting machine to be uploaded into the system or keying data from those checks into the computer software.  Management can be helpful and supportive but the morale is low as there is almost no transitioning to other departments from this one.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the boredom and monotony.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to listen to music through the earphones all day long."
bad,Managers I worked for did personal errands and ran there personal business instead of taking care of the branch during working hours. District manager was aware however management was never held accountable because they are supposedly to hard to replace. I would say by view management has a pretty secure spot.
bad,"Overall could have been a good place for advancement. Training felt rushed and not adequate for the job. Was essentially thrown on the floor and told to “sink or swim.”  Wasn’t offered a choice in shift, was told I could change months down the road, if seniority allowed it."
bad,"WF doesn't pay well compared to competitors. They expect you to work very hard for very little compensations and raises. This isn't like other smaller companies that have summer outings or christmas parties very bureaucratic with no bonuses unless your management. Good place to learn, get trained, and enter the industry when that happens start looking."
bad,Work place culture under the retail department was an HR problem for my last year with the entire department.   Most enjoyable part was mentoring my direct reports and working  with them to achieve their goals to move forward.
bad,Had classes the same time they wanted me to work. Brought in my school schedule that they requested for and could not still work with me on my schedule. Very bad management and leaders. If you are in school dont waste your time because they done encourage you to advance your self.
bad,"Review financial statements to assess cash flow for loan repayment. Interaction with customers and prospects under relationship managers. Learned credit analysis, business analysis and cash flow. Frequent management change led to lack of direct supervision."
bad,Over the last 5-10 years the company culture has changed.  The stability use to be the most enjoyable aspect of working for such a large organization.  Senior leaders are very self absorbed and the employees no longer feel valued.  I've lost respect for the company and unfortunately that will never be regained.  It's very unfortunate.
bad,Newly hired branch manager relocated from the suburbs to the city if Chester with absolutely no idea how African Americans operate when it comes to banking let alone in general. A little sneaky and definitely not a person to trust alongside the service manager as well. Lack of commitment to sticking to the ideals of Wells Fargo out to make self look good not to support team members and the overall moral of the team.
bad,"Wells no longer allows workers to trust - I asked my immediate Supv to let me know of any problems I was having, and to keep me informed if there were  any.  That did not happen, thought all was well - contract ended a few months later no real expectations.  "
bad,It started off good and was a fun place to work. New managers came in and destroyed employee morale. Harassed all day to hurry and not care if you where working right only how fast you could get the job done. Poor management needs to be replaced by someone with good ethics.
bad,"Was excited to work there originally , and 1st couple of years were ok good people to work with but they started making job harder and harder with unrealistic goals. good luck moving up if you are lacking in interview skills or know someone very well.  Also if you do happen to change departments make sure you wait until after your raise otherwise you wont get it. Also raises don't even cover cost of inflation if you do even get one. Yet top Ceos make Millions and are hypocritical,"
bad,To get your foot in the door I would recommend. As a career I would say no. They put a lot on you as a banker or teller and it was truly not worth the head ache
bad,"Wells Fargo is a great company to work for good pay and great benefits ,but terrible management!! Was always micromanaged and nagged. We where taught all rules/regulations and policies MUST be followed ,but the rules and policies never seemed to apply to management. Poor examples set."
bad,"Promises are not kept by upper management. Attention to the minor things is micro managed. Attention to actual issues that need to be addressed is miniscule. The fact is, you are told to do the best you can do with what you have and we'll see what we can do. Things do not get corrected or repaired."
bad,"sales goals should not be a thing for a bank teller. I did not meet sales goals and was let go. That should be a thing for sales associates maybe, but not bank tellers."
bad,I’ve worked in several lines of business and utilized my commercial banking lending skills.  I have 20 plus years as a relationship manager and 31/2 years as a manager. The company is going through constant changes and reorganizations.
bad,"I was challenged everyday. Definitely a place to work at if you're an extrovert and enjoy growing as a team. Mentally and emotionally draining, but doable for those who like being mentally and emotionally challenged. Management varies in that it can be passive aggressive or full on supportive. but it's not hard to find a "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,They compensate very well but not equally on a unilateral level. The benefits include services not generally covered and a higher percentage. Very high school like atmosphere without reprimand from superiors. Extreme favoritism and judgement.
bad,"Wells has been a great place to learn about finance and assist customers with growing financially. However there are A LOT of flaws within the company. Starting as a teller everything goes smooth, then you transition to the next roles and BOOM. There are a lot of politics here and when applying for positions, regardless of what you bring to the table, they will tier out the applicants, from managers first , then higher level bankers, then leads, then tellers. That being said you may never even get a chance and on top of that there may be 50 other applicants. "
bad,"After the lawsuit, WF changed. We had AWFUL management. And he made sure you didn’t get promoted because his retention number were more important. The sell you the position as if you’re going to get bonuses but that NEVER happens."
bad,I don't know about other WF work locations but at the one I worked in  there was way too much office politics to the point that you actually fel the work environment is very unfair.
bad,Workplace culture is good but could be better.  Management does not always consider the well being of their employees.  Good benefits and paid time off.
bad,"If you don't have a grip on things at home,  then when you get to work you micro manage people. That's the type of manager I had. Then if a person that is training hasn't read the material in a while you don't get trained properly. Training used to be good at Wells then they bring in reps that already know the work and will tell the class we are not being trained properly. The quality reps don't have a clue what they are doing.  Paid time off is good depending on the department.  If you are on the phones taking payments then no they don't want you to take time off although you have the time."
bad,I felt like a used car salesman. For example I was helping an elderly customer that I met with regularly. A member of management was observing the interaction and decided disciplinary action was needed when I refused to recommend a credit card sale for a customer living solely on social secutity.
bad,very bad mangment style and very bad reputation. All I have to say is read the press on the company and that should give you the reason why so many employees have left. Sorry to tell the truth.
bad,"You will need to have a strong network of outside purchase driven referrals to succeed here.  If you don't have those coming into to the organization it will be tough to succeed here.  While you will indeed being given time to get a loan pipeline going and being able to work remotely is great, their negative draw compensation program does indeed requires success relatively quickly or failure is likely.  "
bad,"Low end of the spectrum on average pay for the type of work I do and by almost $20,000 a year. I really don’t have anything more to say. Stupid character limits."
bad,"It was okay very sales orientated and a shark like environment. If your are in a cut throat work environment, this would be a good fit. The team  members were great to work with."
bad,they had good benefits and a really nice cafe with discounted meals (and very good food) but supervisors required us to sell. if a customer said 'no thanks' we were taught to 'rebuttal' their 'no' by trying to sell one more time. that is NOT customer service to me.
bad,"Wells Fargo has a culture of promote from within, which is probably great for young adults who are hired right out of college.  But for experienced professionals looking for a job at Wells Fargo, look somewhere else.  Wells Fargo is not for you.  The company will promote less experienced people who drink the Kool-Aid and are lacking managerial skills."
bad,"No specific info to provide. Very strict policies which are understandable, but too much micro management when one is just trying to do their best at their own job."
bad,When i worked there. It was very cut throat and the pay did not add up to the amount of time we worked in order to be successful . I would not recommend anybody to work here
bad,I was terminated because a manager from a department we worked with did not like me personally. I did my job very well and my direct manager confirmed this.
bad,"Worked my way up through several promotions and into leadership.  Paid fairly.  Great time off.  Worked with some great people that I miss dearly."
bad,Hard work does not pay off.  They promote friends or people off the street after I had already been running things since they had 2 managers leave.  I got their almost perfect score on annual check and it was then handed to someone else.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Wells Fargo required it's customer service workers to open many accounts even if the customer did not agree. Therefor Wells Fargo went through some legal trouble because of it.
bad,"a typical work day is stressful at Wells Fargo, Staff Expects you to maintain a fast 3min window per customer.So your focus is to get the customer in and out explicitly."
bad,"When I was employed with this company it was very difficult to feel appreciated and hard to get trained properly to obide by there wonderful policy and procedures. They have some many rules but have so many issues. I loved the two tellers I worked with but management was not management at all. Actually, we did not need management we needed leadership and that was something that this company lacked so much of. If they were to get a Branch Manager that wants whats best for the employees and not just writing them up, teach them. I loved my job in its self but I felt as if I was set up for failure at the very begging when the manager realized that he could not use me as his rat or mold me into a tattle tail for him to be able to write more people up. They need serious changes done mainly on the Outer Banks."
bad,It served its purpose for me during the time i was working there. It allowed me a lot of flexibility in my personal life. Wells Fargo is need of new upper management.
bad,"It is very easy to get burnt out depending what department you work in. They continue to add more duties to positions without compensating. Overall, fun place to work if you have the right group of people around you."
bad,Upper Management bullied middle managers by unnecessary intimidation tactics comparing your performance to your peers for all to see.  A power ranking was produced daily and sent to the floor to intimidate workers to do better than their peers.
bad,Not ready to include my thought on this forum at this time.  It will not let me pass this screen without typing more so I am typing more.  I think the headline speak for themselves. So at this oint they are trying to dig their way out of negative public opinion.
bad,The Marketing team is a supportive environment but the company's upper management is horrible right now.  They need a complete break from the old regime and to bring in all new management.
bad,Phone Banker for the Elite Customer base of bank. Provided daily banking needs. Sold other banking products. Followed all Federal and State Laws covering banking.
bad,no no no no I have nothing to say so making me type to go through your systems sucks so stop it when i'm applying for job. I'm not sure how much much much much much they pay you
bad,I started with them in 2008 and i was there until 2016. Started off great but the higher you go the more stressful it gets and the less you are able to advance. I was making good money but management wanted that to be my whole life and i have 5 kids at home. I would see them in the morning when i left and by the time i would get home it would almost be bed time. There was a time where i was on mandatory over time for a whole year. When i finally left i had tried to post out of the department i was in because it was too stressful and i did not like it and my supervisor and manager would not help me and told a co worker of mine that they were going to make it hard for me to post out and at that time i was dealing with the loss of my mother and both of my grandmothers within 1 year so that was the final straw for me. Depending on the type of person you are it could be a really great place to work or it could be the worst place to work.
bad,As a teller its was ok. The two branches i worked at was a fun environment to work in. Of course you have your good days and bad days that comes with the job.
bad,Management only develops the ones they favor and will throw you under the bus just to save their own jobs. Work is constantly changing which is fine but only give you short training and just throw you into it. Most of the employees know more than the managers and not many are willing to help and don't want to deal with the disgruntle customers
bad,"nothing to say was laid off for the second time. demands are high, no backing from management on credit decision. Unreasonable working requests on hours.  Division across the board with fellow partners"
bad,"The worst job I have ever had. I cried often before work, during work and after. This job caused a lot of anxiety attacks. Would not recommend anyone to work there. Depressing place with no morals or values."
bad,Very slow paced and not a lot of room for growth and opportunity. I was a teller at TD bank prior to relocated to California and I must say that Wells Fargo's culture isn't as diverse.
bad,"Good teams, managers are ok most of the time and the perks are wonderful. The volunteer opportunities are pretty amazing and the customer service appreciation week is always fun."
bad,"stressful, pushy on sales, want you to work a alot of hours but not want to pay overtime, and sometimes not even let you take full lunches or even take breaks but make you clock out for them"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"The managers I worked under seemed to not care about the Personal Bankers or Tellers, only this bonuses and getting the solution mark for their branch."
bad,"Company itself is trying to change for the better but management is not willing to change for the better. If not for such poor management from branch managers to district managers and area managers I would have retired with this company. Excellent benefits! Job/life balance, once again due to poor managers, is very poor. If you are not a pet teacher--you won't move ahead, management has too much access to your personal profile and if you're applying within they do have an ability to pretty much cancel your opportunity to relocate or move up within the company. Primarily management force right now consists of back stabbing, used car salesman, uneducated in their field irresponsible people whom gotten to that position due to their aggressive sales tactics--which got Wells Fargo into lawsuits and other legal issues to begin with. Management is having serious identity issues with managing their team-members towards customer service and relaxed atmosphere where we concentrate on the customer-once again because it is not in their limited knowledge to do anything else but aggressively push sales. However, company is excellent, the best pay in the field even after sales bonuses were canceled; and benefits are amazing."
bad,No comment..move on to look fir a better place to work and it will save you time and stress. I learned the gard way and regret my decision on taking the job
bad,"Working back office in the commercial real estate tax department, I encountered the loudest and angriest manager. "
bad,"Wells Fargo Financial, formerly Norwest Financial, was the small loan predatory lending division of Wells Fargo Bank before the division was phased out of the banking portfolio."
bad,"Working for the company was great! Working under the supervisor and branch manager was less pleasing. Very inconsistent with disciplinary actions across the board. They will review your employment if you had to call in and didn’t have sick time to cover it... but don’t worry, they will let you off with a slap on the wrist if your drawer is missing $2k."
bad,Was told for a year that I would be able to move to more day time hours as no daycares are open past 6 pm but was never moved.  After so many years the raises just kind of stop.
bad,It's public knowledge Wells Fargo practices intentional deceptive ways to make money off their on own clients.  Working for Wells in the mortgage business was very frustrating trying to develop a career.  Wells hires and fires based on volume and there is zero loyalty from the top.  But that's what you get working in the corporate world where the bottom line is keeping your shareholders happy.
bad,"Works well if you are personal with the manager and know them outside of work. Employees do not have good work ethic. Manager lets anything slide if he knows you. Saw many employees doing things that they were not suppose to, did not want to be a part of that."
bad,The best part of WF is the satisfaction you get from helping customers and overcoming obstacles of financial loss or gain. I enjoy talking to all different people of cultures.
bad,We were told in front of everyone how bad your doing. Even when we were the top 5 in the region.  Just a constant were are you now not 5 min ago.  High turn over
bad,"Its a great company to work for, but unfortunately the management is horrible. No accountability taken for their actions. Do whatever they want. Does not work as a team. "
bad,Wells although a good bank has issues with their management from Arizona. A very hostile environment and not a good place to be. Now this was years ago so maybe by now it has improved.
bad,"Hired as a temporary employee.  No opportunity to become full time employee.  After 18 months, you had to leave the company for awhile before you could work there again."
bad,"I have worked at the company for 3 years, negative reputation in the public  has not been resolved and it’s been nearly 2 years. Lots of micro management. Pay structure for HMC’s is horrible."
bad,"I left due to 1) Opportunity with another employer that Wells Fargo could not offer me at that time 2) Being discriminated against by management.   In the end, my manager and his manager ruined it for me.  "
bad,I am under the impression that rules and quotas changed recently so it may be different now. This is just based on when I was employed. Management also plays favoritism when promoting within the company.
bad,"Too many manual processes to be effective. Company does not take advantage of available technology.   There is no coordinated effort to get things done.  Every group seems to do things their own individual way.  Although they recruit good talent, they have a multitude of employees who have been there for 30 + years.  These employees are stuck in the past and refuse to take advantage of the fresh expertise being brought in."
bad,HARP underwriting hampered by inexperienced processors led to the demise of the unit I worked at. Also team managers who made it clear that they had been forced into the job and wanted out. Final team manager had zero experience in mortgage operations and it showed.
bad,Not a great place to work. Job was stressful. Manager was never available. Spent way too much time trying to decipher job requests without any management input. Wasn't sure if I had the authority to do some things.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"During my time working with Wells Fargo, my manager demanded I opened up illegal accounts. I never did that. However, they did everything possible for me to get let go. In the end it was a personal fight between my partner and I that lead to my dismissal. Since then they have changed things, my manager was demoted and employees seem to be miserable as they no longer have goals."
bad,Great benefits but just like every other comp a lot of gossip and poor management. Worked as a retirement rep your given training for a mth and then have 3 times to past or you are terminated.
bad,"I worked for Wells Fargo after they bought out Wachovia in 2009/2010. Overall my experience wasn't the best, although this was years ago so hopefully things have changed for the better since. When was a teller and lead teller you had quarterly sales and customer service goals that have to be met, you would be asked about them daily and asked to sell things that may not actually be in the best interest of the customer (main reason I left). Getting promoted seems as much to do with politics as it does with your work performance, didn't even get an interview for a promotion until after I got Cirlce Of Stars (top 10 teller in the bay area region based off sales and customer service scores). The few aspects of the job I did like was meeting all sorts of people especially being in a branch that gets tourists and being a lead teller in a small branch forming relationships with all the people who work or own businesses in town. This job would be great for people who can sell things they may not agree with or are comfortable selling anything, are willing to politic to move up past a certain point and can deal with stress and angry customers. (you will hear more than once do you know how much money I have when you tell a customer no for something you couldn't do even though it was a valid reason to say no) Being a teller or lead teller or working in a bank period isn't for everyone. This was just my personal experience with being a teller and lead teller at Wells Fargo and unfortunately it wasn't the best."
bad,I focused on training ethical business practices but was continually pressured and trained on unethical practices. My branches never acted unethically and we always exceeded sales and service goals but we were constantly pressured on what more we could do.
bad,typical day was full of stress and emotions. Your work load was more than one person could handle. Communication with the manager was never straight forward and you could never get him on an escalated call.
bad,"The site mgr was completely unwilling to consider either her mgrs or employees input for how to increase production or make the environment more pleasant. Always critical and fault-finding, never praising I think most if not all of the approximately 100 employees were never happy working there."
bad,I worked there before the news broke about the fake accounts being made. The pressure management put on the staff was terrible. Even after meeting your goals early in the quarter they continually pushed you to keep selling more products that weren't needed.
bad,I've been with Wells Fargo for almost 4 years. I've witnessed a rapid decline in internal promotions within the last 2 years with the big fall out from the retail banking department.
bad,"No work/life balance. No growth opportunities. Training was okay, however the management was not supportive. They had mandatory overtime and people were working on Sundays too."
bad,Poor management with a hostile work environment.  Stressful environment. No guidelines or processes in place.  Committed to unreasonable timelines without consultation.
bad,"Why would a company that saves another company from going under, by purchasing them, every let the purchased companies managers take charge of their thriving business. Wells Fargo did exactly that. Wouldn't it have made better sense for Wells Fargo's thriving business to continue running a thriving business as they were before merging with the company that failed to thrive. "
bad,"Wells Fargo is a very cutthroat company.  When I worked there, I was threatened with my job if I did not meet monthly sales goals.  "
bad,"Upper management untrustworthy as shown by the scandal of opening accounts without the knowledge of clients."
bad,"They make you a lot of promises while in training and paint this perfect picture. If it's too good to be true.. it probably is! Right after training all of the groups my training class met with over a course of weeks switched up their great stories about Wells Fargo. High call volume, pressure for low call times."
bad,"I would only go back to work there if I had no other options at all. very small office. The manager at times, could be loud with the staff. Too much effort had to put in for what seemed was very little reward."
bad,"company means a family which they don't want to keep,"
bad,I worked at Wells Fargo when they would take away your chair and tell you you had to make 4 sales by the end of the day to get your chair our of the closet tomorrow. Do I need to say more?
bad,"Learned a great deal about how to keep my Business partners satisfied while balancing urgent Safety and Soundness changes.  As with other banks there was pressure on teams to complete risk reviews and correct issues that were not compliant."
bad,"Stressful corporate culture that promotes the ""Stagecoach"" above customers. Lack of consistency in support and continual roll out of new sales programs."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,The work itself was great. The upper management was ok but needs improvement. The coworkers and team leads is what made the place of work a negative non growing experience.
bad,"Over all people are great to work with . I learned its more important to appreciate your employees more often, improve management and have a workplace culture often not once a year."
bad,"When I started at Wells Fargo, it was a very positive and supportive work environment.  However, when I moved into another division and after the acquisition of Wachovia, the company became too large and it was apparent that the focus was no longer about customers or team members, the focus was about getting ""to eight"" and about share price."
bad,"Starting off on the lower end was rough. When I was there I saw plenty of examples of questionable ethical behavior by the bankers in order to drive sales. As one of the hub corporate locations there was a ton of pressure from upper level management in order to out perform other branches, however every time there was a new lawsuit against the company there was a change in how sales goals were set (so about every other quarter). Pay was well below most other banks in the area but they waived bonuses as a way to make that up. Depending on the time of year they were doable though. Everyone in the branch however seemed to be working towards a position to get into one of the corporate desk jobs. If management liked you, there was plenty of room for advancement into a position with an actually decent salary. Great benefits but overall low employee morale."
bad,"Wells Fargo is a great company to work for, assuming you get aligned with manager's who trust you, support you and allow a work/life balance so you can enjoy work and be the best you can be."
bad,"I had the worst manager to work with,  Non of the employees liked him, He did give me a chance to learn anything while I was there. I did not get to learn much about the workplace culture due to my tight schedule and others seemed to be very busy also. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the change from university environment to a banking job and I did not wanted to stagnate at one place all my life."
bad,"Been here 11 years and it's just been downhill since the merger with Wachovia. My line of work is one of the most profitable for the bank and has job security because few know how to do it or could train to do it, yet the policies, controls and minutiae we have to jump through in the name of risk management make it almost unbearable to get any work done anymore. Meanwhile, it has come to light that it was inconceivably all too easy to commit a large scale fraud to millions of customers in another part of the bank. By my count only 5 executives or senior managers have been held accountable. The smart seniors, reading the writing on the wall, left or retired between 2010-2012. Their replacement EVPs are largely still in charge today (I verified) and egregiously left a quarter million workers holding the colostomy bag as it exploded. What type of company culture does that to its employees??? "
bad,I have learned a lot at Wells Fargo but I am underpaid for the job that I do and the knowledge that I have. I also feel that the management should be better and should provide more support for the teammates.
bad,"Wells Fargo is Extremely numbers oriented, Everything is measured down to how many times you viewed a client profile against how many products you sold them."
bad,Once you have a shift its very difficult to change so apply for the shift you need. Advancement is who you know not what you know. If you do get a good shift they have good benefits.
bad,This is a good place to work the only problem is that all they are conerned about is selling items to customers who dont have the money already to pay for other items
bad,"WF has great benefits and hour flexibility. It can be a good place for a student or a recent graduate to start experiencing the financial industry. however, their promotion is solely based on their high target goals and it does not necessary mean that you will get a promotion just because you worked hard."
bad,Great with the right leadership but lacking in proper market pay. Typical day includes sales and referrals as well as cash management and compliance. Minimal recognition and pay.
bad,I don't feel I have enough knowledge for the type of firm I worked for in order to complete a fair review.  From the short time that I worked there it was very clear that they were extremely successful in the financial world and would continue to grow
bad,Was a very complex place to work. There was a lot of fraternization among the employees outside of work which made it difficult for those who didn't.  A lot of cliques. It seemed as though individuals would advance based on who they knew and not what they knew.
bad,"I feel this position was misrepresented when I was recruited. They said it was customer service but the goal was sales referrals, meeting quotas. I was told at the interview that the main part of the job was providing excellent customer service and helping the customer. Once I was trained and on the phones I was constantly monitored and told my calls had to be shorter and I had to get more transfers to the sales department."
bad,"We pull complaint cases, research and provide resolution to customer and make mitigating risk to both the bank and customer. Pay should be higher. The pressure cause so much stress and it almost makes it feels like it not worth going in to work."
bad,I have no issue with a sales environment.  The issue I had with Wells Fargo is it a competitive sales bank.  People go in to make deposits/withdrawals and are heckled into getting something they don't want or need.  Tellers can rarely keep up with the high demand of sales per quarter so turnover is high.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"As a loan adjustor specialist, it is my job to review and request the proper documentation needed to process and approve short sale liquidation options for clients nearing or in default. The work is not hard from an intuitive perspective, but there is little-to-no reward and upward mobility is non-existent. Due to a recent hiring freeze and consolidation efforts, our pay has been diminished, commission cut, and our role has increased in responsibility with no proportional incentive. Last, but not least, the hours for my position were changed from 7 AM - 3:30 PM (CST) to 11 AM - 7:30 PM (CST). Upper management is out of touch with lower-level employees and despite what the company says, the goal is not to help customers succeed financially but rather to maintain/increase shareholder value. The people and culture is great, the benefits are above-average (which is how the company offsets attrition in lower-level roles), but moral is dwindling despite the recent scandals that have come to light."
bad,hardest thing is the people  you are the face of the company and are treated as such by the management and customers. this can be very good or very bad.
bad,"working as a bank teller is pretty much the same as any bank. You handle money. However, when I was at Wells Fargo, they were hellbent on the tellers selling products to customers while they performed their transactions such as opening another account, booking an appointment to sit down with a banker, among others"
bad,"I enjoy working for Wells Fargo, but this department needs new management. I have voiced my concerns and there has been no followup performed by upper management."
bad,"Good team relationship company with not good management.  Not flexible to listen to employee.  Hardest part was relation to management, easiest customer."
bad,Wells Fargo definitely has some of the best benefits that I have seen from a company in a long time.  Medical and dental is amazing as well as vision along with other perks such as a 401k in which WF matches up to 6% of your contribution and provide every employee with a 1-2% dividend deposited into their 401k every April.
bad,Work was stressful.  Immediate supervisors were good to work with.  Often required OT even when on short notice. Failure to do OT was looked down upon even if already had plans
bad,Wells Fargo is like working in a silo inside of a silo.  My work instructions were very vague and the person who was reviewing my work had no interest in the quality of what I did.  She was more worried about her I watch and make up.  No more Wells Fargo for me.
bad,"I have worked for Wells Fargo for a little over a year now and I gotta say, Its been a roller coaster ride to say the least. Constant turn over leading to being short staff on average throughout most of the year. Quality of new hires and management promotions have been at a all time low. Constant harassment from customers about things in the media talking about the company. Lack of compassion between management and team members."
bad,"I loved working for them at first, but then management was changed and overall goals were changed and in my opinion unattainable.  Local management did not seem to care about helping employees"
bad,I give this job 2 stars. The management is terrible and will let you go for being a great employee for fear that they will be replaced. They will also make up fake job incident claims to do so.
bad,OK place of work but employees are not treated as good as they could and for what is expected in workflow compensation is very low.  Management is very weak and unskilled with little knowledge to provide guidance to employees.
bad,"When I worked here, Wells Fargo was considered a trusted company. This impression was matched by its conservative culture. This was one of the things most liked about the company, which has since been tarnished."
bad,I felt the competitive nature of the atmosphere in my branch. I felt welcomed at first but everything changed gradually. I would not recommend this position to anyone who expects a great relationship with their co-workers.
bad,"your job is never secure.  precarious advancement and placement decisions.  terminate at will.  corruption and ethically challenged.  "
bad,Advancement opportunities were only available for college degreed individuals - which is logical - but did not help my situation.  My work experience was not taken into consideration.
bad,"This company overall does have great benefits for its employees. A typical day consists of helping customers as well as making referrals for sales opportunities. Recently there has been significant changes within the company as a whole as well as on individual store levels. The hardest part of the job, I think are sales goals unless you are a salesperson and enjoy selling. The most enjoyable part of the job are some of the people that you work with daily."
bad,"Robert Half doesn't really like at for it's employees interests.  A six month contract turned into only two months on the job because of overstaffing due to the fact that work that they believed justified hiring more employees never materialized.  In addition, personal items were not sent to me after my services were no longer needed as they expected me to come pick them up when it was a 30 minute drive.  The could have easily have shipped the items to me.  They wanted me to stay in this position even though I requested they try to get me into another position because I knew about the lack of work."
bad,"I processed attorney invoices in the foreclosure department. All day I would approve, modify, or reject invoices. I learned the importance of paying attention to detail, and working as a team. The management did not really give the proper tools in order to be successful at Wells Fargo, and very little training. The most difficult aspect of this job was that I did not receive very much training on how to be a processor, and management could never answer my questions because they did not know how to do the job either. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with a great team, and the work/life balance."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"They are an aggressive selling company. It's not about the employee, but how much sales you can help the company make off the Customer, but being that they are in the spotlight,  they make it seem as if it's all about giving the customer good service and that's it.  The benefits as well as the Diversity is Awesome. No matter how hard you work or how good of an employee you are, If management don't like you personally.. they would do what they can to terminate you or they will keep you in your current role until you decide to want more and leave the company and if you try for another department or Market they will tell that manager bad things to keep you from growing with the company."
bad,"unreasonable sales goal. Manager was impatient and harsh. Expected to do far more than you were trained to do in unreasonable time spans. Expected to sell things/pressure customers to sign up for checking accounts, loans, and credit cards."
bad,Just another big bank.  My manager was amazing. My service manager was really hard on the tellers. She was really tough on the younger kids that worked for the bank.  They all tried very hard but it was never enough.
bad,"The work environment has drastically changes since I first started working there.   I use to be a great place to work at and many of the employees seemed to enjoy working there till the company started to focus more on their sales goals instead of the customers or its employees (WF CEO Scandal).    Lacking at Wells Fargo is also the work life balance and many of the employees do not enjoy working there anymore since it is a very stressful environment.  What is still great about Wells Fargo is the people there since it is a familial environment, with the exception of most of the management.   Another great thing about Wells Fargo is the benefits that it provided from the from the Medical and Life Insurance policies it offers it employees to the Paid Vacation time."
bad,"Environment was typical big company. There was tremendous turnover as it did not seem they forecasted the need for employees very well. In the department I worked, financial counseling would have assisted the borrowers in the long run rather than the temporary adjustments WF offered."
bad,I learned a lot of exposures to the Leverage loans industry. Working with cash flows associated to the multiple deals. allocation of cash flows to pertinent accounts. created portfolio reports
bad,"This job was stressful, long hours and weekends. Horrible for a healthy work life balance.  Very stressful, demanding sales goals and rude hostile customers. Short break periods and very little management support"
bad,"There are numerous opportunities for Wells Fargo to improve and be more customer focused.  Management is one place to start.There is very little work life balance, stress levels are high, most departments are understaffed, overworked and managers look the other way because they was to make bonus. Very disappointing work environment."
bad,at first it was great. I was excited about going to work everyday and then 2 months in the branch manager was leaving and will be getting replaced by a disrespectful and rude person. He will always raise his voice to the employees(adults) and belittle us for being ''just tellers''. in the first 3 months he was there 4 people left including myself. Never again.
bad,"Great benefits...politics as usual"
bad,"Good Benefits for family leave and PTO.  Health, vision, and dental is also a plus.  Matching 401k up to 6% and can flex hours with manager approval when needed."
bad,"There was no typical day as we were building new products and branding along with messaging. The company is built with a variety of associates from former banks as Wells Fargo bought many clients and combined work forces."
bad,"Too many layers of management."
bad,I was not a fit for this kind of work.  I was yelled at constantly by customers and while I can handle most situations and calm people down it did get to me after awhile. I was put under unrealistic goals and we called people when their payment was 1 day late.
bad,"My work day is something of a major guideline to hustle management, having a team that's on my side. Making good company core decisions."
bad,"Log in to your computer check for appointments, call and set more appointments"
bad,"Long days, usually 10 hour shifts for full time. PTO is great, usually 150 hours a year to use. Pay isn't bad, but pay raises generally only happen at promotions otherwise they're like $0.10 a year. Sales is #1 priority. Sell, Sell, and Sell some more. They're lowered goals over the years, but it is still all about how much you get from a customer. Bonuses aren't great unless you're a manager. Great environment to build relationships with customer and team members. Team members become like family which creates a great environment if everyone is selling. You get an hour lunch, and can take breaks as often as necessary. Advancement is easy if you can sell. Many can get promoted within a few months."
bad,"hard to work ,always push for sales ,they want you to not talk about sales but expect sales .You are only numbers to the management no personal touch at all."
bad,"After working with Wells Fargo for over 17 years, my last position was with customer service which is not where I wanted to be.  There were 3 positions that I had that I was enjoying very much but they kept doing cutbacks as well as changing the hours of operations to unacceptable hours."
bad,Wells Fargo used to be a good company but recently with the new management they are only after sales and not integrity. they no longer care for the employee and their benefits.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,The hardest part of my job was going to work every day not knowing if I would be laid off that day or not.  My manager was great! She was always there to help in anyway possible.
bad,"I would rather not say. I do like to discuss prior jobs, The position does not line up with a work friendly environment, The floor has lost 75% of their employees, with others leaving."
bad,Work daily to meet the financial needs of customers. Had teh best manager when I started worked with great people. Sales Goals where sometimes overwhelming. Most enjoyable part of job is helping your customers succeed financially.
bad,"Wells Fargo is known to a lot of people. They paid me 10.00 an hour and their incentives, as this is a selling position, were not very good. The goals seemed impossible to reach and the company is very strict about meeting goals. You're always worried about losing your job. "
bad,"Management is handcuffed by upper level management preventing innovation and ideas to improve processes. "
bad,"Wells Fargo has great benefits, but the possibility of professional and financial growth is slim.  Wells Fargo is NOT family oriented.  I have not had a raise in 3 years, but yet they expect us to attend a monthly meeting telling us how much money we made the company.  I appreciate the job because it is my lively-hood in providing for my children - but each year I bring home less and less. My benefits cost increase, but my annual salary does not increase with the cost of living."
bad,"I worked only as a teller for roughly 6 months for Wells Fargo right out of college and it was everything I didn't want in a job. Sales were pushed so much, and we were micro-managed to such an extreme. You constantly had your supervisor stand behind you listening to you greet customers and they wanted you to say the EXACT 5 phrases to every customer."
bad,"Hardest part of my job was the unreachable sales goals. GREAT benefits are great as well as the pay. The pay is good, management not so good. They need more training to see how hard it is to sell products to customers that already have tons of products with us already. I loved my hours. Made lots of friends. Learned a lot about the finance and banking world."
bad,Middle and Upper Management set unrealistic sales goals for the rural retail banking market thus creating far too much pressure for the teller side as well as platform to engage in unethical sales practices. The customer's true needs are shoved to the back of the bus in an attempt to meet these goals for acquiring bonuses. After that begins to sour the turnover rate increases and customers are forced to deal with impersonal robotic type banking. I believe the rise in popularity of the small credit union is an accurate reflection of this. I could go on and on but it is really a moot point as my rant is sure to fall upon deaf ears or blind eyes
bad,"A typical day at Wells Fargo can vary from day to day. Usually at the beginning of the day I would sign in to my cash drawer. Then I would proceed to start my daily chores Brinks shipment would come, I would verify cash and store it away properly. I then would proceed as the custodian of the ATM start my process of deposit pull and loading cash. When finished I would make sure all paperwork is stored away appropriately. I would then check my ordering list and then order if needed. I would also take customers and provide excellent customer service between doing this. Doning overides and checking on transactions was another part of my job. I am used to working in fast paced and stressful situations."
bad,"All the same things as an other bank does. take deposits, cash checks, handle cash, help clients. however I haven't heard great things about Wells Fargo. And when I was there we had about 3 managers."
bad,A fun big time company to work for and develop with. A big diverse of people to work with or along side with. Many opportunities to develop your skill sets. The one thing I will never forget is my customers that I have developed a bond with.
bad,Systems were antiquated.  Upper management was not supportive.  All about production and little emphasis on career growth.
bad,"Most managers are promoted for their ability to cross sale products and services to customers in their banker role; unfortunately, many of them have little to no skills in managing others.  I enjoyed helping customers with questions, concerns, and also with new products or services.  It was not difficult for me to obtain my daily sales goals; however, it never seemed like I did enough for the management team/district manager.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the diverse team I worked with and inclusive work environment that we had at our branch."
bad,Loved working with the customers and also with co-workers. Fun to work at and loved dealing with the pressure during busy days.
bad,"The company has an aggressive sales approach which leaves many to questions their own ethics to reach sales goals.  Just not the company for me, I want to service my customers, not sell them."
bad,"Although they claim to focus on customer service, profit will always come first to this company even if it means convincing customers to open accounts or credit lines they do not need. It is all about meeting sales quotas, nothing else matters. Management was poor and did not take pride in their work. Hard to advance, required to be in a position or at least a year before advance, even if fully qualified. Also long shifts for no reason, worked multiple 9, 10 hour days with only a half hour lunch despite having staffing for regular 8 hour shifts."
bad,"Upper management has great ideas about how the company should be working. They push the middle so hard to get that result though, and everything below that falls apart. My department had little regard for what you do as an individual. I was there for almost 10 years and they no longer value integrity and good solid customer service--they just want you to sell people stuff, & don't care whether you actually solve the customer's problem. Mandatory overtime of several hours a week has now been required for 5 years running with no workaround or flexibility, & they wonder why they can't retain their employees. If they could replace you with phone sales drones, they would."
bad,"Cross Selling is the only focus now, firing employees who are great at their job in every area that should matter but if the cross selling results are not meeting the ever ridiculous quota (which continues to rise) than you may not have a job next month. Expectation for customers to say yes to cross selling, leaving you with no real control of your job security. Stress!"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"My honest review is I hated everyday I went to work. I was demoted due the call center being bought by this company an a lot of changes took place, Eventually they shut the center down,"
bad,I worked for a very busy mortgage processing division.  What was nice was you were able to learn may different jobs because if one area was slow they would train you into another area to help out.
bad,"Too much to do and not enough people to do it, with a lot of pressure to perform at 100% all the time. Staffing levels have not increased although the market is recovering."
bad,"9-5 Easy"
bad,"If you don't mind having a superior yelling in your ear while assisting customers on the phone, this job is for you. Typical day would include helping customer on the phone with account issues. The hardest part about the job was trying to find products to sell to customers that had little to no money in their accounts. The best part of the job was leaving at the end of the day"
bad,Wells Fargo is a good company and has a great benefits package.  The Personal Banker position has the highest turnover and may not be suitable for most people.
bad,"Honestly, I couldn't handle it.  Getting berated by people every day over the phones is not something I truly care for. I've worked in customer service since I was 14 and yeah, people don't know how to treat one another but at the same time I never had it worse than when I was there.  Before I quit I went to everyone I could and asked how do I get through this.  Unfrotnualty they all just told me to suck it up and told me some of the things people have ever told them, which didn't help."
bad,"A typical day was going directly to your work station, logging into the computer and opening all of the windows needed to communicate with management. Log onto the phones and start taking calls. Calls were required to be completed with each customer in 3-5 minutes, having to complete about 90-100 calls per work day. There was little communication between employees except at team meetings conducted approximately 1 time per week. The hardest part of the job was building a relationship with a customer to provide great customer service in the amount of time allotted."
bad,Overall this is a nice place to in a professional setting. Eveyrthing is fast pace and you have to be open minded to the many different challenges that you will face
bad,"No flexibility with hours, Management lies to the face of both employees and customers, demands that employees put customers in financial situations that are not in the least bit beneficial to clients and in fact hurt them, unreasonable ""sales"" goals, pushes employees to promote before they are ready and then demotes them weeks after for appearing ""unprepared"" to meet goals & lastly, the most irritating requirement is having tellers ""lobby lead"" (stand up front, open doors, offer customers drinks, pester customers on what business they hope to accomplish--to which the answer is usually ""mind your own business"") for hours out of the day based on who is least liked by the acting manager of the day and then the teller is lectured for not meeting sales goals for the day when 4 of their 8 hour shift was spent opening doors."
bad,the management watch everything your time is not your. even when your off work. the time when your on the phone you have to think sell sell sell. your a phone banker but before you really answer the customers questions the first thing you have to have in mind is what to sell them
bad,"Unexciting, bureaucratic and political place to work. A lot of work could be easily eliminated but people hang on to their jobs."
bad,Working for 100% commission was impossible because of the lack of back office support.   One can make the sale up front but had no control on getting it closed because of extremely poor quality processing and operations management.   This created an extremely poor customer experience and stressful environment for the sales people.
bad,"Great place for advancement, but work culture is so-so. I have learned great information regarding finance and money management. The co-workers are friendly."
bad,too cut throat. atmosphere was very tense. very little training
bad,wells fargo is a large company... they waste a lot of money on training people... to get them through training and most are fired within a year.... spend more time trying to fire people than trying to develop the talent that they have....
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Learned a lot in the banking field.  There was little room for advancement with this company
bad,"The job is completely micromanaged. Management in general is not very professional from my experience so far. There are a few good leaders in the building, however, the overall environment is unprofessional."
bad,"For the most part, I did enjoy my time with Wachovia, it was when it merged with Wells Fargo that things went down hill. I learned a lot about the banking industry and there are parts of it that I would not mind going back to."
bad,"As a Service Manager II I was responsible for all branch compliance, teller training, teller staffing, meeting branch sales goals, etc. I worked 50-60 hour weeks to get it all done and was not compensated accordingly."
bad,"A typical day at work would be reviewing documents to make sure documents were correct.  What I learned was to be more open and express any concerns or ideas I might have. Management was great to work with,  easy to talk to when there was questions.  My Co- Workers were a great group of people, we got along really well, worked together for over a year, knew what each other strengths were.  The hardest part of the job, was having to take a document back to another team to correct before passing the document.  I think the most enjoyable part of the job was when my co workers would go out to lunch or have some kind of outing."
bad,"I worked in the Health Benefit Services department of Wells Fargo. I assisted customers with their accounts and other duties. While it is a call center environment, I enjoyed what I did, and absolutely loved my co-workers. Per personal research, I learned a lot about HSA's. The down time was also nice and relaxed."
bad,Management likes to pit all the producers against each other which causes a very aggressive work environment.  High turnover which comes as no surprise for those that have worked at Wells Fargo in general.
bad,The management style is terrible! They hire managers from outside the company and know nothing about what their employees do.  They are full of lies and secrets and will throw anyone under the bus any chance they get. Your co-workers cannot be trusted.
bad,"Annual bonuses are only pennies on the dollar, benefits are wonderful. Supervisors don't listen to the employees concerns, and the employees are stressed out!"
bad,"I worked here for over a year and never really got a long with my boss.  Then one day without any real warning I was pulled into an office with my bosses boss and terminated on the spot due to being caught twice in the past six months using chewing tobacco at work.  I understand that this is a rule and that I violated it but I feel this is a very petty reason to terminate someones employment.  Further still, the manager that was my bosses boss was the one with the authority to terminate me and the first words we ever spoke to each other were the day of my termination."
bad,Wells Fargo is very cut throat and shady.  People do questionable things in order to get their numbers
bad,"As a employee with the company is it vitally important that you meet sales goals. Meeting your sales may be difficult, however, management is alongside to help reach them"
bad,Answering inbound and outbound calls. Collections is a very different environment. Management works closly to improve performance. Co-workers are team oriented. The hardest part of the job is being to customer centric for collecting payments. The most enjoyable part of the position is satisfying customers and creating the payment structure that the customer can afford.
bad,"I loved my job when I started.  I would still be there if it was the job they hired me to do!  Great managers, great co-workers, great training, great pay and benefits.  Then came the changes!  System updates were numerous, confusing and counter-productive.  Underwriting took a back seat to extremely high call volume.  Majority of calls from untrained and inexperienced bankers calling to complain, slowing down underwriting process to a crawl.  System not designed to effectively and efficiently handle the application volume and a lot fell through the cracks.  NO work-life balance and NO advancement support from management despite what they promised in training.  Flexible schedules became mandatory overtime and Saturdays as short term fixes that did not solve the problems.  Work Directors do all of actual supervision while Lending Managers ""manage"".  Apparently they have been told they do not need to know how to do the jobs, only how to ""manage"" their people.  Upper management is unsympathetic while trying to give the perception they care.  Improvement ideas from team members were solicited and ignored.  It was the most stressed out environment I have ever worked in, and I watched the morale among my co-workers sink lower and lower.  PTO days were being taken for sick days and mental health days than vacation time."
bad,"They ask for TOO MUCH, and nothing you do is ever really good enough for them."
bad,"They push sales like crazy but tell us to follow a line of ethics that would dictate us to do otherwise.  Upper management seems to have nothing better to do than to send out nonsensical drivel and spam my e-mail.  I spend all day taking at least twice as many customers as the other employees because they weren't trained properly on a simple computer system."
bad,"The summary says it all. I think Wells Fargo is an amazing company. They do great business and they are successful in almost everything that they do. "
bad,"A typical day at work was very stressful. "
bad,"moritor ID, secure the permit."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Wells employed 300+ individuals under false pretenses. We did not know or wasn't told the criteria set forth nor we were advised of the conditions we would have to work through during the training period.
bad,"Typical day answering back to back phone calls, managing daily goals and productivity numbers. Learned great customer service skills. How to defuse irate customers and open their minds to new ways of banking. Management is mixed, there are the ones that care about you as a person and those that treat you as a number and only talk to you when you're performance is not well. Co-workers are very diverse. There's lots of interesting people from young to old. In rough times when the job is difficult and demanding they're the only ones who understand you. Hardest part of the job is managing sales numbers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the schedule. There's many shifts that work with you're personal life."
bad,The company keeps changing with an expanding work environment and narrower marketplace with more federal restrictions.  As a result however it narrows what employees can do and their overall effective job performance.  
bad,"day shift"
bad,"Tense work environment, direct manager was borderline verbally abusive. HR was no help. If they want you to succeed there then they will do whatever it takes. However if you're not one of the chosen ones (and you'll never know or understand why they don't like you) then you are left to sink or swim with cement shoes. This was the strangest work experience I have ever had. It took quite a toll on me the first few months until I finally stopped caring. Proceed at your own risk."
bad,"Daily sales goals with zero recolection of past performance. Management does not care how you get sales, so long as you get them. Each personal banker is required to have minimum ten solutions per day, regardless of customer traffic or reason for visit. Management pushes and pressures so hard to reach sales goals for meaningless solutions such as additional atm or debit cards and online banking, when in reality they benefit the customer in no way at all. The machine of wells fargo produces two types of employees, those who play ball and open accounts/products that do not benefit the customer who either get promoted, or get caught and get fired. The other type of employees are those who do not play ball and only act in an ethical manner when it comes to opening accounts, and those people are told they are failing constantly and put through countless meetings on how their position may not be the best fit for them. I am licensed to discuss investments which is what I want to do for my career, and investments, and home equity lines are where the real money is, and you can exceed in these areas, but if you don't hit your pointless ""solutions per day"" goal, you are considered a failure. The core beliefs of Wells Fargo are sound, however middle management seems to be jumping over a dollar to grab a nickle. The main factor should be customer service, and the sales goals in place contradict customer service because it leads to unethical sales practices."
bad,i love the job but there is really no movement in the company you are pretty well stuck where you. I have learned alot of the finincial industry and mortgages and all the documents that are required in order to have a mortgage and what amounts you are approved for and also the requirements and guidelines that need to be followed. the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that I am helping people stay in their home
bad,learned alot about sales and financial options. Pushed myself to make my sales quota
bad,"Started off great , but downnnn Hill after that .....Company has changed.. Micromanaging."
bad,"I needed to take LOA for my mother was dying, the HR staff was helpful but my branch was not and would not take me back after my LOA ended."
bad,"For the most part I enjoyed my peers and most of the customers. It has the potential to be a perfect job except you have solutions, solutions, SOLUTIONS. I can honestly say that this is the main purpose of this job. I don't think the managers care about their employees either, they make act like it but when it come to those solutions they'll look at you funny it you're not up to par. I only enjoy some of my peers and the pay but then again I was only part-time."
bad,"As a former Wachovia Bank employee,and before the Wells Fargo merger, the benefits were fantastic and the environment very good. However, once Wells Fargo took over they took away all of our family-care days and the medical/dental/vision benefits are lackluster now. Most of the insurance is employee-subsidized and you only have $800 to $1200/year of expenses covered - anything over that you have to meet a hefty deductible, while STILL paying the $400 to $500/month in premiums (for a family of 4). The company touts its focus on ""work-life"" balance, but a lot of departments expect you to put in 50- to 60-hour work weeks, and can be very unforgiving if you have to miss work to take care of a child/parent."
bad,"My responsibilities as a Home Preservation Specialist consists of being the single point of contact for individuals undergoing foreclosure, or who are experiencing any form of excessive financial obligations with maintaining the original terms and agreement associated with their FHA loan. In addition, I assist with implementing affordable payments plans for the borrowers to remain in their home. I gained an extensive amount of mortgage experience associated with FHA guidelines. I would rate the Wells Fargo management team of Birmingham, Alabama a #7. My colleagues are very enjoyable to work with daily. The most engjoyable part about the job is assisiting homeowners to remain in their homes."
bad,Try to sell credit solutions and other financial services to some of the poorest people in Jacksonville. :o( Very disheartening. I mostly educated people for their personal financial literacy. Meetings every morning and every night with pushy management whom were totally out of touch with what was really going on with our client base.
bad,customer service and doing what ever the customer needed. trying to push sells on every customer to sign up with what ever offers they had on the screen.
bad,"if management is good, its a great ride. if management is poor, its the worst company to work for."
bad,As an employee felt my voice and opinion did not matter to this company.
bad,"I am usually a happy person but ever since I started working for Wells Fargo, I am stessed all the time and do not enjoy going to work every day. The personal bankers are micro-managed constantly, given goals that most of the bankers consider unattainable, and the focus changes every day for different products. This company is all about making money and selling rather than helping the customers with issues or answering banking questions. It's required to sell to pretty much everyone and assess needs on every single person that walks in, regardless of the transaction. Not a fun company to work for. Many bankers that I was hired with are already working for other companies/financial institutions because of the stress they've encountered working for Wells Fargo."
bad,"A typical day would consist of meeting and greeting clients to identify potential sales opportunties. If you don't have a client in your office, you should be either on the phones or in the lobby interacting and trying to make your daily individual sales goals designated for you."
bad,"Good Company to work for if looking for good benefits. Wells Fargo is very sales orianted. Most of the management only care about the sales and numbers you produce, and I believe its because it comes from up above. They say they are all about the customer but I have seen customers close thier accounts due to, basically being harassed, to open a new account or sign up for new products everytime they came in the bank. They are all about the numbers, which make the customers feel just like a number and not important."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Overworked, underpaid, not appreciated for working as hard as I did. Need to care more about the employees. Very understaffed for the location I worked at. Qcr,W"
bad,"I have enjoyed working at wells but I am beginning my outside job search because no matter how qualified I am there is no opportunity for advancement as a women. The job posting process is horrific. You may post for a position and never hear from a recruiter or be dispositioned  promotions are based on backroomdecisions and not merit based. Interviews go to those who are favored by the inner circle. Sr leaders are a small group of men who surround themselves with other men. Yes there are a few women in leadership roles but they are the exceptions "
bad,"I started working for this company when I was 18. My experience at the beginning was very positive as well as for my beginning transition into management. Once I became a part of management, however, the façade faded and things changed quickly. Though I received compensation suited to a 40 hour work week, it was expected that I work at least 50 hours a week without breaks as well as every weekend. It wasn't until I had a doctors direct, written order to take breaks and to only work 40 hours a week that the pressure was no longer applied. I later transitioned to a role in the mortgage division I had my weekends back and it was nice, but when I applied for supervisor roles I quickly realized that it wasn't what I knew, it was who I knew. I ultimately left the company because I had my first child and the inadequate work-life balance was no longer conducive to my new goals as a parent."
bad,"More sales driven than customer service driven"
bad,Lots of changes when Wells Fargo purchased Wachovia. The insurance benefits were good. Sales goal were very questionable. Turn over was high. As a leader was asked on numerous occasions to deliver corrective action that I did not agree with...
bad,"Management sucks , mafia style promotion process, Miami wells Fargo culture is the worst . you can complaint with HR that is worthless, Districts Managers are careless about the employees"
bad,"Given the companies past with sales actions certain steps were taken to move away from sales goals.  The sales goals have now been replaced with ""customer interactions"". These interactions are where management hopes we can have ""meaningful conversations"" and get a customer into a new product or have some type of referral sent to another team member."
bad,"Sweatshop -  would work 12-14 hours per day 6 days a week for months. Would not/Could not hire additional personnel. "
bad,"Quality review team insures each employee is monitored and measured constantly to drain every tiny bit of productivity out of them."
bad,"Descent support staff, insufficient changes to leadership at a pivotal moment. Management not concerned with issues faced by employees if not a top tier producer."
bad,"My management chain would not hire someone to help me in my role.  Being the only person that does my job is very stressful, which has caused me to have 2 mini strokes."
bad,"Over all Wells Fargo is a good company to work for as an entry level employee. Once you move into leadership the game changes and you will most likely no longer enjoy your job overall. Leaders are literally given the job duty to micro manage their managers and team leads below them. No matter how high up in the company you get and no matter how well your team is preforming, you have to attend a meeting with the person above you, daily, weekly, and monthly to explain everything your doing and why. This was extremely frustrating because it wasted a ton of valuable time.  You must be willing to adapt to changes in procedure in the blink of an eye. This was fine for me because most changes were positive and in the right direction, It however is very hard to make your voice heard when you see something wrong. The HR department is no help and always on wells Fargo side, not yours. This includes incidences such as unethical sales, customer survey grading scales witch effect individual bonus, and also they will constantly find loopholes and little technicalities that cause you to not get your bonus from things ranging from team performance and other factors that they play into your bonus as well having to do with over all performance.  They created a very hostile environment regarding discussing pay. It wasn't until I pointed out the pay secrecy act to a corporate visitor that it was finally made clear we are allowed to discuss pay with one another excluding management. Manager still tried to hide and restrict us from talking about pay but it was too late. over 50 employees had discussed"
bad,"The good,"
bad,"I am currently not working I was displaced from Wells Fargo in 2017"
bad,"Overall money wasn't terrible, not as great as you'd expect. My main manager was not great/knowledgable, supervisor below that was awesome, and the immediate boss was not very nice. The job was extraordinarily stressful as losing money at a bank is NOT something anyone needs in their life, and it is way too easy for that to happen here. Overall would just recommend another line of work honestly."
bad,"I started when it was a Midwest mortgage company known as Norwest.  When there was the merger of equals back in the early 2000's there was a definite shift in the culture of the company.  Up until around 2015 I was happy to work for the company.  There were elements that occurred that were likely true across any large corporation, less than admirable wage increases.  Constant ""record profits"" that never made it's way down the chain.  Reduction in the quality of benefits vs. the cost.  Those were frustrating but seen as a cost to do business and stay employed."
bad,People were poorly training yet expected to be successful.  Finding someone to show you the ropes was critical.  Groups were silos so one group could be great to work for while another was a poor experience.  Lack of controls and oversight has allowed employees to work dishonestly which has caused the firm's poor reputation in the banking industry.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Faced paced high volume inbound calls"
bad,"From the start Wells Fargo comes across as a squared away financial institution. However, after the first few months, it becomes quickly apparent such is not the case. The management staff promotes on who they know and like. The cliques are like being back in middle school. My time there was well compensated but if I had the opportunity to go back there, I seriously doubt I would. Hopefully at the new location, senior staff will take a better interest in employees and examine the skills and knowledge of the promotable. This company is under a lot of scrutiny right now and I would hope their number one interest would be in keeping the employees happy. These employees are your number one defense!!"
bad,"I was hired and the department team mates are/were not welcoming.  I call it the mean girl syndrome.  And example having a party to welcome a new member, already with WF.  I was a new member and was never invited to participate in anything let alone a party.  The training I received was horrendous.  I was set up for failure and the only saving grace was the fact I have experience as an underwriter.  I am currently looking for a new position.  I do however, think a lot of my manger.  I come to work to my job and leave.  Not a fun environment or welcoming environment at all.  I have spoken with past employees and I find it amazing that this is still going on and was when she was there in 1999."
bad,Slow paced work environment.  Friendly culture.  Learned opportunities are unlimited.  Enjoy coming to work each day.  Leadership is new so somewhat unorganized (uncontrolled).
bad,Great for young people so they can stay there forever and grow with the company and are in 401(k) and stocks. Overall not a bad company just a lot of micromanagement and constant worry about passing the phone surveys and also the quality assurance is always listening and making sure you don’t say the wrong words or mislead the customer.
bad,"Management want you to know that they want to help, but they cant really do anything. They say one thing but the other some other day. Team members are okay as they comes from all places and in all age group."
bad,If you want to work for Wells.. well good luck being a slave. They don't care about you and they try to get you to do fraudulent things all the time. Managers can harass you and get away with it.
bad,"Sales, sales sales..."
bad,I have neutral feelings for Wells Fargo and hope that the last two years help shape a stronger culture and investment in their team members. For now people will continue to look to new horizons for growth.
bad,Positions in wells is all about politics who knows who advancement is not happening  company is trying to rebrand  it still no raises more than 1 percent
bad,"Things may have changed since I worked for Wells Fargo because of the lawsuits, but when I was there it was a cut-throat business.  You had to reach mandatory sales goals or have to deal with management being all over you for not reaching them.  I was good at this job so I did not have any issues.  My issue was when the store missed goals, it became my job to fix that problem.  The issue was some people were not cut out to be bankers so they could not come close to their numbers.  I mentored them and they still usually failed.  I have been told the work environment is not like that anymore, but I don't know."
bad,"Cut Throat management, goals and public trading are all that matter. Hours were good, Monday through Friday 6-3. Like all companies, needs to raise wages and be more flexible with time off or schedule flex."
bad,"Fellow co-workers made it a good environment, which made it enjoyable,  but the management and leadership did not provide the necessary training to help you succeed."
bad,The company is dealing with immense change that leaders are resisting. Causes significant lack of clarity and resources to meet the needs of customers and regulators
bad,"Wells Fargo work environment is very pleasant, the dress code is very relaxed as well. The only negatives I would say is that if your a contractor working for Wells Fargo you are not made to feel apart of the team. You are an added entity, which at times made me feel invisible to my team. But I guess that's the down fall of being a contractor in this organization. Once your contract is up and you've made your contribution you are discarded while having all that knowledge and familiarity of the company. Also the grace period between rehiring needs to be abolished, because you must wait six months to be rehired at the company, while unnecessary  time and money are being spent retraining, onboarding, investigating and screening/ acquiring new employees. Those who have made that transition into the company, know the environment and have gone through the training and background checks, etc.  are left to take their knowledge of the company elsewhere."
bad,"When I worked at Wells Fargo, we were required to sell banking products to potential and existing customers. However, these banking products were often not in the best interest of the client. This did not matter to upper management. "
bad,"Wrongful termination for refusing to open accounts for members that did not want them, or could not afford to get extra accounts. Branch manager had zero banking background."
bad,This job was really not about servicing its customers it focus majority on sales and sales. It did not fully prepare you for the job at hand. Company was all about numbers and not assisting individuals customers and how to make their banking experience more effective.
bad,"for myself i enjoyed those I have worked with, if you got a great manager you will LOVE it. Not a fan of their products. Goals were crazy, but I heard starting pay has raised.. that's a plus."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Very fast paced,dealing with irate customers most of the day."
bad,"My experience was not all negative at Wells Fargo. However, the bank pushed sales products that often times the customer did not need. The bank was more preoccupied with meeting sales quotas than to meet the needs of customers. The positive side of working for Wells Fargo is that it's a professional environment with the possibility of growth."
bad,"""8 is great"" was the company's slogan towards selling products. 8 was referred to the many accounts one recommended. This was also the day goals to help reach at least 8 products a day as an individual when it would be a blessing just to be able to get one person a credit card."
bad,"Wells Fargo is trying to change the image and culture they created. My take is the effort is an expectation that it all happens at once. It is quite risky to attempt both major organizational transformation from a seriously and deeply embedded linear function culture to anything more nimble and multi functioning and trying to do the same with the technology infrastructure. Team members can find it extremely to maintain during change while attempting to navigate and embrace the new functions of the change."
bad,"I feel the hardest part of the job was knowing how much the company net income and the unwillingness to give a raise that was somewhat decent. Great people that worked there , hard working people that worked there , pay was not good."
bad,Wells Fargo provides good business experience. I work with customers everyday trying to resolve their hardship to help them keep their home. If we are unable to provide a solution then we discuss next steps to either keep or sell their home.
bad,"I quit because I felt that I could not keep hitting my goals without breaking basic standards of morality, and every Friday we would have to sit down and say why we didn't hit our goals."
bad,"Before all of the changes the job was Great, now management isn't the best. and the only way you  advance is  based on who kisses up the most and not what you are actually capable of."
bad,"big part of your work day is managers and coworkers, ater the fallout of the ceo and pushy I don't suggest, over all it was ok experience as a teller to step into the banking industry and you do have opportunity to get promoted"
bad,Very diverse culture and caring. My peers and I were committed to doing the best to our ability. Regardless of senior level management inconsistencies
bad,Great people to work with and management overall was okay.  They do work you to the bone and don't always show the appreciation. Not sure if it was just our department or not.  I just wish they would have said thank you a little more.
bad,"I worked at Wells Fargo when they were still selling bank products, there is room for advancement. The company is tough to work for though because of how sales oriented they are. I do have to say they were high in salary compared to other banks."
bad,"If you're looking for a job, there's almost always one available here.  Usually in temp work, but opportunities for full time do open.  However, there's no guarantee you'll be hired on full time."
bad,"when I interviewed for this job it was a customer service job and I was asked would I mind referring people to sales if I happened to see that they had a checking account but no savings account and I said no, I did not have a problem with that, but when I got actually working on the job it had very minimum to do with customer service, they pushed sales and if you did not meet a quota you were let go!"
bad,"Hostile environment. Many advisors are not organized and their clients are annoyed with them.  Client associate takes the heat.  If you have the right advisor, the job is good.  If not, you are stuck."
bad,Loved my job at Wells Fargo However the supervisor was less than desirable. It definitely worked at digging people down when we went from the most amazing supervisor at wells fargo to one they must have pulled out of what they could not handle before. Lack of respect for their team and work ethic was beyond poor. When confronted about the tension that was being caused by said supervisor watch your job because it will be on the line. No one is safe when it come's to personalities conflict.  Watch your back because the clicks within the supervisor status is one to be reckon with.  Would never send anyone to work there just to end up with depression and anxiety. Pick Supervisor by their knowledge and how they manage people not by who is friends with whom.
bad,The pay was competitive but the schedule and culture was not for me.  Too much micro managing going on.  Changed schedule n you with out much notice and with any input.
bad,Its an okay company to work for. The pay is good but the management could be a lot better. Wells Fargo does not accept doctors excuses or anything so its kind of hard when you don't have the pto hours and you get sick or family mmers get sick.
bad,I could only work here for a couple months. I was in their call center and could not handle getting inbound calls and being yelled at all day long. And after speaking with an upset customer being required to try to sell them a product or service.
bad,"Great place to work, great people to work with every day and great work life and home life environment. Salary could be a lot better but the benefits are great."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Large firm with many different career opportunities.  Currently suffering from poor reputation due to regulatory issues.  Changes are being made to rectify matters but morale is lagging in many areas of the firm.
bad,"I enjoyed my jobs however the demands, atmosphere and poor Management made it difficult to continue working there. It caused me to retire. The Management would take credit for any new ideas that were suggested by employees."
bad,Most of the managers are good but upper management cut them down quickly. My position had a volume of work that needed 12 was cut to 5. When the deadline was not met they wonder why. No overtime just constant stress to crame so much into the day and still it is never enough.
bad,"A very demanding job. Nothing is consistent. You will get a different answer from anyone and every one that you ask. Even in a management position, you do not get paid enough for what you have to deal with. Since the company got in trouble for opening all of those accounts without the customer's knowledge, they focus completely on the customer surveys they receive. If your branch gets anything under five's when the scores come in weekly, you will get a stern talking to. The only real good thing about this job is the hours and bank holidays."
bad,Wells Fargo is a good job for a person who is just starting in the workforce they offer full benefits to part-time and full-time employees the pay is OK but it could be a lot better
bad,"Wells Fargo has an excellent culture of support on the lower echelons of its management and team. However, the upper management has little understanding of what makes their company work and how to maintain slow, steady financial growth without creating major incidents that result in sudden shifts to the work culture. When this happens, the entire onus of the failure is thrust upon those lower echelons to the point where they increase expectations and slash available resources."
bad,"Not professional, everybody in the city worked there. compensation was poor. Not a cultivating environment. It was a fun place to laugh and meet new people around the city."
bad,"Wachovia sold to Wells Fargo - the company structure was less than desirable as to heir business practices. "
bad,"High stress environment, heavy workload and at times can be an unprofessional atmosphere.  There was not flexibility with your time however it was great pay and great benefits."
bad,This job has pretty good benefits however they do not have tuition reimbursement unless you are wanting to go into something that has to do with finances.  I personally would never recommend this company to any of my friends however the people that I worked with were a lot of fun and I really liked the people I worked with however the management was not the best .
bad,"I actually enjoyed the work that I performed and was happy with my direct supervisor. However the upper management was often battling one another and made vindictive changes to policy on their way out. My workload was doubled, and my incentives for taking on the additional work was reduced significantly. In addition my co workers and I were lied to for over 2 years in changes that were promised to allow us to accelerate our careers. Every 3 months I would ask for an update and they would say it's happening and they are close to finalizing the changes. They never came. The final straw was when they attempted to tell me I couldn't have time off for my wedding. This was after I submitted the request nearly 4 weeks in advance. They waited till the week prior to tell me they didn't have the staffing/hours available for me. To recap, I was happy doing the work, but very unhappy with the management."
bad,"If you like a high pressure sales environment, you will love this job. I worked as a licensed personal banker and all I had to do was identify customers, and pass them along. The cold-calling, the scouting, and the endless deadends wear on you after a while. Especially when you aren't the one earning the big bucks. No thanks."
bad,Typica day would star off slow a lot of questions concerning what was in the news.  Energy in the center was high but stressfully a lot of employess was angry about thier work schedule.
bad,A big cooperation that focuses more on sale goals than to take care of their employees. Mandatory meetings done every Friday to only talk about sales.
bad,Working was stressful. Never leave on time they was always a issue. Management was poor no communication at all. Poor raise every year if qualify. Not a good place to work on less u are willing to work for little money.
bad,High pressure sales/customer service environment.  Lots of micromanaging.  Poor management style.  Work life balance lacking.  Decent salary with great benefits.
bad,"Good - PTO/Benefits"
bad,"the leadership at wells fargo needs lots of help, most managers talk to their employees like they are stupid"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"The hours aren't too long and the pay is great it just didnt fit well with my personal values. I, of course, enjoyed working with all the customers but the atmosphere wasn't good for me, personally."
bad,"Doing financial transactions for people, while trying to sell them some product. It was fast paced and fun to talk to people all the time, I was at a very busy branch and the line was always long which made things stressful."
bad,The details of the actual job requirements were perfectly acceptable however the pressure from management was unacceptable and being asked to preform things that i personally had a Moral problem with was eventually what helped me decide to leave.
bad,"I left because I was managed out after a very successful six year career. No regrets I am in banking because of the foundation set by Wells Fargo and I have advanced far in my career at a young age. The micromanagement eventually gets to you, especially when you go to senior management and they look the other way."
bad,"Come in a set time, do the same process over and over and over."
bad,"Micromanaging!  No one is treaded like an adult, it didn't matter if you got your work done or not, you could be on every project group under the sun and you were never EVER doing enough.   Your family didn't matter, you must eat sleep and breath WFA"
bad,"Even though there were a lot of changes at Wachovia, my job was secured because I worked in scheduling. Despite that, it was a nervous atmosphere because changes happened constantly and no one knew what was going to transpire on a daily basis."
bad,I didn't like working with wells fargo because they didn't recognized as much for nothing I don't think I would like to go back to work there
bad,A typical day include review of a pipeline of files of about 60.  The hardest part of the job was not having an attainable goal of files to pass per month.   I liked my co-workers.
bad,"This position is focused on getting the sale. If you are uncomfortable with pressing people to accept a sale, this position may not be for you. I love the servicing part of this job, but the sale is what matters."
bad,Best speak on the phone like you are happy happy smile and dialing. Other team members terminated for minor little things. Had enough and quit. Managers are rude. Lack of job security.
bad,good place to work for a first job out of college to experience corporate culture. Document custody is definitely not right for everyone.
bad,"It is good pay and good benefits and you can easily advance if you make good sales, but it isn't worth it. The managers and work environment is so stressful. This company only cares about making sales. They don't care about employees or customers (no matter how much they claim to care all about customers). They are constantly on your back about making sales, forcing you to pressure customers into trying to open services they don't really need. And if you aren't meeting enough sales they pressure you even more. The best thing I ever did was leave this company"
bad,I was constantly being pushed to do more whether I liked it or had fully learned the task.  You were constantly being put under a production improvement study.
bad,I worked as a CSR in Moorestown nj. The pay is very competitive. But the work environment can best be compared to as a pressure cooker. Management not very supportive. Coworkers were great but the pressure for sales something made coworkers become savages and steal accounts.
bad,"If you can't sell, then forget it.  This is a fast paced high pressure sales environment period.  If you are not comfortable with this then do not apply to any retail store."
bad,Manage the day to day operations in a fast pace department to make sure customers service level agreements are met daily.
bad,"Processed closed loan files for Home Equity Lines of Credit / Home Equity Loans"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"My work day begins with greeting to and from all or most employees at the office.  Run all bank reports and company reports balance both. Enter and release all wire transfers – electronically and manual, balance end of day"
bad,Wells Fargo treats you as if you are just another number. Being that the company is so large they were able to provide good benefits however working as a mortgage servicing specialist there was a high stress environment with minimal breaks. There was additional stress added because the time you did take was micromanaged and everything you said and did was reviewed. The benefit of combing through everything was the chance to learn from your mistakes. However even though I was doing the job effectively it was not an environment where I felt I could develop any skills nor was it a place that would lead me down a career path that I desired.
bad,"No matter how good you think you are or try to be, nothing is ever good enough. I hear about all these branches that do things unethically, and in my branch we do everything by the book and guess whose always getting wrote up for not meeting sales goals. I would no recommend this company to anyone unless you want to work for people who only sees numbers. They say do what is right for the customers but there is a goal on the number of customers that don't need it but still gets it so the upper management can get their incentives. I absolutely hate working for this company"
bad,"My typical day is taking customer transaction and offering all or any products and services that company has to offer their customer. Management is usually depends on store manager. My manger is kind selfish and does favoritism between their employee. But, I am able to manage my work and personal life. The hardest part is making sales goal every quarter. I enjoy doing transaction, ATM, Vaults settlements, Balancing cash-box, Auditing other cash-boxes. Benefits are great for an employee."
bad,"This job wanted us to work over time without pay. I worked weekends and brought work home with me very often. It was very stressful. They demanded a lot from us. Although, we did receive bonuses sometimes. My co-workers were the best part of that job."
bad,it is very hard to work at Wells Fargo. you get well payed but the sales goals are very high. Management is very hard on you and too much is always wanted from you.
bad,"Worse management I've ever seen. Very, very, poor and uneducated individuals who use nothing but rhetoric to stomp on peoples heads. The company discourages using your brain at the sales level. "
bad,"Overall I loved working at Wells Fargo. I started when they were Norwest and transferred within and worked there collectively over 12 years. Fabulous experience in Minneapolis, MN."
bad,I had little to no communication with my manager but that seems to be par for the course at Wells Fargo.
bad,Good place to work ability to advance. Lots of customer interaction.
bad,Management was awful.  There was no training. The Manager used to sleep at her desk.  There was no training.
bad,If you like sales and friendly competition among other store and team members this is the job for you.  I worked in a high volume store I loved helping the people but sales was a challenge for me.  I enjoyed finding solutions to help the customer out and giving them peace of mind when a problem arose.  Management was very sales orientated  and did not understand if goals were not met.  Was very frustrating at times.
bad,"I did not like working for Wells Fargo, but it was the company and I's fault.  I am not good at collecting money, and could not demand money form someone that didn't have it.  They train you to be polite and courteous to the people in collections, and train about the laws that get Wells into trouble for not following them.  Then do not reprimand the workers that don't listen to those rules as long as they are collecting.  I was not good at collecting Wells Fargo was not good at following their own policy."
bad,I work in a high pace enviornment. however I truly have a passion for the work I do daily. However every day is a fun and exciting experience which enables me expand exercise my skills across the board. I partner the managemnt and co workers on a daily basis to reslove and new and challaging situations. The hardest part is when a customer escalte to management.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that everyday brings a new challenge
bad,Great place to learn how to meet and converse with customers in a high paced production role
bad,Days consisted of back to back calls and intense sales goals.
bad,Lots of pressure. I didn't wanna sell my soul so I left before it took me. My coworkers all either were divorced because of their job or were dang near close. It was like being in a shark tank of money. Pure Evil.
bad,"I moved up pretty quickly at Wells Fargo, however, being new to management and not understanding my essential job functions due to lack of management help and leadership I was not an effective leader and had quite a bit of push back from the employees that I was over.  I went to my management team, Branch Manager and District Manager regarding the issues and was not helped or backed up in the slightest.  I was literally yelled at by the employees I was over, had constant attitude from them and they were not performing their job duties.  I finally gave my two weeks notice after not getting any help or support.  Pay was okay, benefits were decent and the time off was pretty good when we were fully staffed and able to take vacation days."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Management needs to treat employees better. Would have been great if that was a key factor.
bad,"I worked in a very large Call Center as Phone Banker. There is constant pressure to meet performance metrics, especially in sales."
bad,"The general labor is easy and enjoyable when you get to interface with customers, but the pressure to reach certain sales goals causes some questionable practices imposed by managers and bankers. There is, however, a lot of room for growth and pretty decent job security if that is where you want to be for a long time."
bad,I enjoyed working there. Great work environment. Learned a great deal. More than imagined.
bad,"Wells Fargo is a well-respected company in it's own right, and does know how to manage their teams in an affective manner. However, the particular position I held at the company was one of many introduced into the Wells Fargo team at that time, which caused a lack of training for the position and therefore a lack of direction and efficiency. While I did enjoy my time at the company and took aspects of what I enjoyed in the workplace with me when I left, I did choose to take a position with a company that had more to offer me at that time."
bad,All this company cares about is sales. It makes it really hard to work for a place when they don't care about you as a person. You are forced to make sales to people who really shouldn't have those products.
bad,The branch I worked at closed and they gave us two months to find a new job.  That left a bad taste in my mouth.   They do treat you well if you’re at a good branch
bad,"A typical day at work is the exact same everyday. I could do this job with my eyes closed the second day I started. The only time I have ever felt challenged in my position is when I have had a difficult customer. But, never fear! The manager will quickly do anything to get them to leave somewhat happier than when they came in (even if that means bending the rules and making the teller and lead teller look like they have no idea what they are talking about and have originally given the customer wrong info). This is just a job. While I think to most people, saying that you work at a bank is kind of better than saying you work at a fast food restaurant, I am pretty sure you get paid more working at a fast food restaurant."
bad,"I am not a Wells Fargo fan.Working here will stress you out and it is not worth pay. Please consider other employment , here l is not it. Only been here for a year and I’m ready to go"
bad,Wells Fargo is a good company to work in. Good learning especially in credit strategy teams.Great work-life balance and competitive compensation and a good bonus.
bad,Poor leadership which results in being reactive instead of proactive. Creates a constant stress filled environment. The processes are not clean and it is a system as learn as you go.
bad,"A LOT of the supervisors play favorites. I’ve had 4 one on ones in 6 months, and you’re supposed to have them every week. If your sup doesn’t like you, you won’t receive the training necessary to advance in the workplace"
bad,"This company hypes the benefits, but you will find yourself stressed, with management that constantly changes. I had a manager that did not know the responsibilities of her position, but spent more time micromanaging and gossiping to her colleagues. This was the management! Hostile experience and I am proud to say I do not work there! If you want to live check to check and be stressed do not work here without a license. There is little to no support. Drama filled call center and overworked with no acknowledgement of accomplishments."
bad,"Management at the branch I worked for was terrible. The branch manager allows bankers to do whatever they choose and they are often out of place, rude, and condescending.  As a teller you will go through 3 weeks of training, then you are put out on the teller line.  Once you are on the line you have to balance your drawer at the end of each shift, if your drawer is not in balance you can get into some serious trouble.  To be completely honest; the tellers here are awesome.  The bankers however, sit up on their high horses and boss tellers around and are often extremely judgemental and out of place.  I do not recommend working for the Brigham City branch, however, I think this company might be great if you worked for another branch."
bad,Fast paced customer service job in business online banking as a banker coach mentoring and coaching new hires as well as existing colleagues. Many departments in the contact center(CIC)
bad,"they tend to hire people only to lay them off when business gets a little slow."
bad,I do not want to do a survey. The company was a horrible company to work for. Inconstant in their training and everyone wanted you to do things their way.
bad,"Fortunately, I hear things have changed since I was working in a contract role at Wells Fargo, in their Enterprise Division. There was a great deal of turnover."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"To sales pushy, this was before they redid the way they do customer service. Everyday it wasd 6 how are your getting your goal check with us before you go to lunch and where your at for the dadi with your sales......"
bad,micromanaged for 7 years!!! very what have you done for me lately attitude and expectations. all about the bottom line and units. seriously political in all districts and they have their next leaders and DM's selected in advance. if you aren't old school WF then don't even bother. certain bankers did what it took to make goal and district leaders would turn a blind eye. lots of favorites so if you don't drink the koolaid then you aren't in.
bad,"Secure place to work. Not a good company culture. Too corporate. Overall not a bad place to work if you're sales driven. Branch managers differ, some of them are great, some are not so much."
bad,Worked here over a year. My contract was extended. Top management left and even the department managers. Not good. Keep to yourself. Do the work. Take a break to breathe. Too much like high school.
bad,"If you’re not kissing the right managers tail, then you will NOT grow within the company. They will keep you stagnant, they word play with “teamwork” a lot. Pay is decent enough if you don’t have a family."
bad,"I have much to offered and feel frustrated that I am consistently passed over for promotion. Althought your compensation has been fair, you have been unable to promote someone like me to a higher position. Whereas others spent a short period time here got train right away for new position and got promoted."
bad,I have worked here for a couple years and have had terrible management and nothing is going on to fix it. I have been harassed and bullied by my boss and it has taken a huge toll on me. I have filed reports but just been told not to worry about it and to respect my manager since she is my boss. I don't know what else to do other then leave at this point. It’s just sad since I just recently bought a house and the pay here is pretty good.
bad,There was no way for me to grow in the line of business I was in. Every other line of business to which I applied wanted six months experience in that line of business.
bad,The company was driven by profit and no personal feeling to it. I was just another employee number that was trying to help them profit. I was given no real direction or help from management.
bad,"Manages the teller services function to ensure prompt and efficient transaction processing and the generation of sales through quality referrals. This job is a working manager where greater than 50% of their primary duties are spent in non-management responsibilities. These duties will include as necessary teller and lead teller functions. Establishes sales referral and service goals. Creates, trains and coaches a successful service and referral team. Responsible for effective staff salary administration and rewards. Is responsible for scheduling staff efficiently to maximize resources and achieve service and sales goals. Ensure compliance with audit and operational regulations and guidelines."
bad,"If you want a job that gives you more work than you can handle and then bullies you when you can't complete it, this is the employer for you. Highest turnover you will ever find at a large bank."
bad,It may not have been for me. But I personally didn’t like working there. I was there for 4 years and had various horrible management and they constantly asked me to work more hrs than I was hired for. And at times would try to guilt me for not taking more. But not every manager is like that.
bad,"Work everyday was unknown as there were multiple changes at WF over the course of working there. Great place to work, wonderful people to work with. The management was fair, but had favorites. Pay was not very good."
bad,"Management was good in some departments as a temp. Disappointed in how they treat Temps. They expect quality work more than a full time employee, come in at there beckon call, no opportunity to get hired on as they don't consider you an internal employee even though you may be in the department they are hiring for. They would rather not pay benefits to save money by hiring contracted temps."
bad,I worked for this company for five years and I only received three raises. I was there during the time where management was pressing their employees to get sales by any means necessary. I had a manager who was very combative it was his way or no way. This man hated me so bad that corporate ordered him to give me a raise because my name came up on the list of Tellers who were underpaid. He spread rumors about me being difficult to work with. So corporate wouldn’t consider promoting me.
bad,Typically you start the day with a log of the business lines that you have to complete access for. The company is extremely behind in granted access to lines of business and they pressure there Security Analyst to complete the work quickly.
bad,The company is okay.  I suggest a way to improve is to take the associates serious when they call in with no other option but to speak with corporate HR about management or supervisor's abuse of power or bullying.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Wells Fargo has change a lot over the years. What was once a great company to work for,current  reputation has made it very difficult to build B to B relationships."
bad,This was one of my job description. They change production scales to fire me. If you are at 50 yrs old or you have reached your pay scale they fire you.
bad,"The company offers great benefits for full time and part time however, the company has very poor leaders and they treat part time employees like 2nd class citizens and they dont treat you like you are important."
bad,Good career growth opportunities. But pay is too low even if you have a lot of experience and the medical benefits are awful. Only HD plans available so your paying for health benefits you can barely or never use because you're deductibles are so high and your pay so low you can't afford to go to the doctor. Almost like having coverage to use in case of a catastrophic event or illness.
bad,"There is no shortage if bad news about Wells Fargo. That alone caused high stress. People would call in and accuse me personally, even though I either wasn't the department that handled the foreclosing of homes illegally, or opened fraudulent accounts despite me starting after all of that had changed."
bad,"Working at Wells Fargo was very interesting, however after being transferred to a different department I was not able to commit to the different work hours."
bad,This is a great company for people just starting out in the industry. But for seasoned workers the pay is lack luster and the pay increases makes you not want to stay.
bad,"Hired me at one rate, paid me less....very bad behavior, extremely shady organization."
bad,Wells Fargo is a big business and treats their employees as so.  Very little consideration on the individual results and more concerned with ensuring the public image of diversity is seen.
bad,"my experience is extensive thru Wells Fargo, I've learned a lot in the world of the leasing finance specifically in the collections dept and end of lease asset returns"
bad,"Great management team, not enough room for advancement and the hours were excessive due to the amount of turn over at the time.  Short staffed almost always but the management team tried really hard to keep us happy"
bad,Work a consulting Project Manager. Learned the IT process of API creation and Developer's Portal to support. Most enjoyable part of the job was learning new development application.
bad,I enjoyed the loan writers I worked with but management for the particular department did not care for their employees all they cared about was the numbers
bad,Fast pace lot of cars students & teachers not much room for advancement lot of commotion on a daily basis  I was young and needed a job it was good at the time
bad,As a teller at Wells Fargo I learned that not all jobs are created equal. They tell you you're the backbone of the company yet get paid like an inexperienced teen. Quarterly sales goals are team-based so even if you deserve your $1200 bonus you are not obligated to anything unless your store as a whole does well. Not fair and highly stressful job.
bad,"You never know when you will lose your job!"
bad,"Decent to above average benefit, however, yearly raises are considerably less than standard of living increases. Senior level management recieved much larger raises than average worker. Just outsourced thousands of jobs overseas and plans to continue layoffs."
bad,Hard working fun environment where I learned how to teach and lead co workers on how to multi task and to work as a team rather than working alone daily
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Teller, counting, balancing, customer service. work culture was not good, very demanding to let customer to open new accounts. management was terrible"
bad,Had a great experience at Wells Fargo and had a good support system just little to no development opportunities.  I appreciate the experience.........
bad,"horrible environment, management was very pour, disrespectful, and made a number of unethical and illegal comments. hard to advance to a hire position"
bad,Stressful atmosphere that is focused on driving sales. Hard place to maintain a work/life balance. Little diversity in upper management and little room for promotional growth.
bad,"Pleasant workplace, personally rewarding work responsibilities, above average pay due to strong base + bonuses, training enabled by OJT experience and FINRA licensing."
bad,"I was given goals, but was told to give my sales to other associates that had higher goals than me. This caused me to not hit my goal at times. I witnessed associates creating accounts without the client there. I was very uncomfortable working under the management I had. I believe working in a finance industry, associates should be trustworthy in which I do not see the staff I worked with were trust worthy at all."
bad,"I worked at Wells Fargo very briefly. I asked during the interview if the position was a phone position. I was told that no, it wasn't a phone position. However, I might need to call account holders for information occasionally. It became apparent very quickly that you had to call EVERY account holder. I was honest in my interview. I wasn't looking for a phone position."
bad,"Wish there were more managers that are more transparent and made the company's employees feel valued, even when told it would benefit the employees to do a bit more overtime. That's time that was not appreciated and time that I will never get back."
bad,I was repeatedly asked to trick customers to signing blank forms and then later our bankers would open accounts for the customers in order to meet our sales quota.
bad,while working at the wells fargo  i experienced terrible management and support from any one who was in a position of power. the monetary incentives for people in power led to this
bad,"I took the job with high hopes that I would love my job. Unfortunately, within the first few weeks with my manager it became clear that I would not be happy. The sales goals were incredibly hard to hit, there were other sales representatives that would steal your sales, the managers wanted you to lie, and I could go on. My particular manager was the worse on the floor. She was loud, obnoxious, and had certain prejudices. She encouraged me to lie to customers to hit my sales goals. I was told at one point to not disclose all the terms and fees for the accounts I had to open. I wasn't able to make it a full year before I left this company."
bad,Did not like the where I was. Didn't place me in a spot that suited my goals. I would have liked if they put me some where in the athletic field and not behind a desk.
bad,"they took the time to trained me properly in all matters of the business i was involved in, they provided great support with quality and experience manager willing to help to teach at all times"
bad,"Limited growth opportunities in current position."
bad,"Overall it is a good place to work, however the opportunities for career betterment are limited. The ceiling that is in place within my department make it difficult to see a career develop."
bad,too much sales pressure. This type of pressure was not reviewed during the interview process. It did not work for me. I do not want to go in to any further detail.
bad,"I worked at Wells Fargo between 2011 and 2013 so hopefully these things have changed. What I experienced at Wells Fargo was that there were great benefits and percs as well as opportunities to advance. However, there were these extremely aggressive sales goals that took away from the supposed mission of creating and maintaining long term relationships with the community. Some of these sales goals were unrealistic for the location and demographics as well. These sales goals also added so much pressure that morale was often low, stress was high, and the temptation to participate in unethical practices was always present and sometimes implied by management. Any form of sincere and genuine compassion or empathy for clients was often discouraged especially if it meant missing a sales opportunity. Aside from the sales issues was the culture of back biting, low level politics, and spiteful dog-eat-dog mentalities among colleagues. If you can stomach these things for the payoff, I would recommend it. If not, stay away from Wells Fargo. Unless, of course, they have truly made strides to improve the workplace culture and predatorial sales policies."
bad,"no structure provided by upper management. leaving branch level managers with all the work load, Creating a horrible work environment and causing a lot of stress to the team members."
bad,Unfortunately the firm took the wrong fork in the road and lost its way. The culture changed dramatically over the years as mergers and aquisitions occured and increased pressure to perform was placed on its employees.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Wells Fargo was a very driven quantity vs quality company.  They pushed the employees to work as hard as they could without very much recognition. We were paid commission based on the borrower's comments on the survey that was sent out. So if one person was unhappy, regardless of the situation, we would not receive our commission. Very frustration enviornment."
bad,"Hours were not the best. "
bad,"Constantly under staffed putting more pressure on current employees to preform outside there current role.  Computer system is extremely slow and dated.  Old dated equipment because of the rural area.  Quarterly bonus structure is flawed for tellers and bankers.   Making budgeting cuts that do not give bankers the tools to succeed ex: VERY high interest rates, low CD rates, outrageous fees of some products, taking away online stations for customers."
bad,"Collect on past due 2nd mortgages, dealing with bankers and realtors."
bad,"It tough to work in a place that has no ethics, their new brand is a joke. I laughed when I first heard the commercial. I don't recommend it as a place to work nor a place to take your business."
bad,Seems like they have changed their core values as of recently so working there might be different now. I just hated the strict sales goals and how hard they pushed you to meet them.
bad,Working at wells was very unethical didn’t care how many hours you work as long as your there. Was written up for things I was forced to do then after was punished.
bad,Wells Fargo is extremely tough on sales and forced products on customers even if it was not a good fit. This was true even if it was a teen or someone that was struggling to pay their bills.
bad,Made permanent friends.   Pressure to take so many calls per hour. Customers were calling about their money and if they had serious questions it was impossible to get off the phone in 4 minutes.
bad,"How can they let an individual go for credit background check, when the company is fined billions of dollars for illegal practices.The company can stress people out."
bad,The mortgage side of the bank is interesting to be honest. The front lines of fulfillment is good with the support of managers. When there are changes being completed to anything in fulfillment it seems like it wasnt thought out. The incentives are always changed like a carrot at a end of a stick.The basic mortgage consultants that i dealt with were mostly under trained and not knowledgeable. That can be said for the sales managers as well. The processors and underwriters are expected to know all requirements for lending. They like to stress that opinions matter from the employees but that isnt supported based on decisions.
bad,Had a Manager who didn't like me period.  He was threaten by myself because I am a Army Veteran. I did not like the way that I was treated.  Much better place now.
bad,"Even if you're a top performer they will not reward you with proper compensation based on your production. Yet they are very high-pressure when wanting sales. This was back before the whole scandal. I've heard things have changed now, but I doubt the compensation is any better."
bad,Good company to work for however pay is below avg for the work.  Management has a high turn over however they can play into your favor as there are many great mangers and supervisor that do work there.  I recommend internal operation vs the public branch.
bad,This is specific to Outbound Sales in Auto Financing and Refinancing. Too competitive and ridiculous Expectations. A and B Reps can steal the loan that you have worked so hard on. Pay is ok but the commission is pretty horrible considering you have to maintain a certain percentage to keep your commission. The people were super nice though and they always had Bagels and donuts.
bad,The department I worked in was a farce and had lack of any structure. Wouldn't work for this company ever again. After seeing this department no wonder why they are in trouble for unnecessary and fake accounts
bad,"You go through a month long of training which is actually really fun and it sucks you in but once you start the actual job you find out really quickly that it's not for everyone. You are sitting in front of a computer for eight hours, answering call after call and they are supposed to only be 4 minutes and you have to help customers with their problems and then recommend a product."
bad,"I prefer not to provide a review of a typical day at work, what I have learned, management, workplace culture or any aspect of my job at Wachovia. Thank you."
bad,Management would overlook a supervisor that had a successful team and promote a supervisor that had a team filled with HR issues that spread across the entire collections floor
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Job always threatened....stressful work environment....pay was ok and the benefits were good, but at what cost to you as the employee? For what the job was requesting they need to pay much more than they do"
bad,"Big company but was very slow to complete the loans we provided them with."
bad,"Work environment consisted of low energy coworkers, since they are drained from the high sales pressure, constantly profiling customers and calling prospects."
bad,"I was moved up very quickly in the bank, but management was rude and could never get on the same page. They did not tell me my job was a sales position until I nearly failed in the 1st quarter of my new position. Very disappointing."
bad,"Wells Fargo was stressful, management made everyone below them push sales/""solutions"" on customers making the tellers and customers uncomfortable. Management seemed to only care about themselves, would shun those who did not meet sales goal because it made them look bad. The culture was overall good. The hardest part was meeting sales goals because most customers came into the bank already knowing what the needed to take care of. The most enjoyable part was learning about how the bank runs and working with the customers and building relationships with them."
bad,I enjoyed working with the public and being a Bank Teller in general. I have worked for Banks in the past and have always enjoyed my job. Working for Wells Fargo is very different. It is a cut throat working environment.
bad,"Stressful. too much compliance and internal issues.  "
bad,working for a national bank was eye opening. The things I learned of money management and customer service were amazing. Being on the phone 8-10 hrs a day can be difficult
bad,"Culture tends to change with location of office. There is a disconnect between management and basic employee. Great benefits which is a major plus. There is no room for growth within the company once you have entered,"
bad,"Great place to work.  Great organization, management, and culture.  Compensation is good.  Mobility is very good.  Colleagues are very good to work with."
bad,"Felt the service dept was not able to keep up with the accounts"
bad,Manager had a poor attitude when it came to managing her direct reports; was always negative and degrading.  Was also unreasonable when it came to teaching new tasks - complete lack of patience.
bad,"Although there are many great aspects about working at Wells Fargo-  a large company with ability to relocate, the people who work within Wells are extremely easy to get along with, and the benefits are all within reason-the culture is unavoidably primitive and somewhat negative. With the settlement currently hitting the entire business, the culture is rooted in the past. I would describe the culture at Wells Fargo as extremely inflexible and very negative. I can think of only three times in my 2.5 years at Wells Fargo in which we met with management or senior management and the news or message from management was positive. Almost always, when meeting with management, the news being broken to our group is negative. XYZ product is being cut, XYZ benefit is being cut, or XYZ group is being closed out. It's hard to stay positive in such a negative culture-a lot of which has to do with the massive regulations hitting the bank in light of the fraudlent account settlement. I love a lot of parts of Wells Fargo, especially the people I work with, but the culture is difficult to absorb."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was helping clients succeed financially. As a loan officer, I was given the role of helping clients reduce and consolidate their debts through lower interest rate instruments, such as home equity lines of credit and unsecured lending."
bad,"While it is a good job and well paying, the management is very strict and focuses only on the negative and not a lot on the positive, It is very rare and that the mangers do give praise reports but for some they really don't care about how well your doing and although they think they are helping you they are really stressing you out more and it feel like they set you up for failure."
bad,"a typical day consists of answering phone, greeting customer, and helping resolve issues for customer or providing a service."
bad,"I'ts been a long time since I worked here.  I was not happy with the culture of the job and want they were asking us to do as tellers.  It was anything to make a buck or ""sell"" to the customers.  I didn't agree that was what a bank was there for, so I found a job that better fit my needs."
bad,initially was let go due to pregnancy. had to dispute the decision through an appeals process to be rehired. after the rehire was treated very cold so i ended up quitting and pursuing other career goals
bad,"Training was good but not really what the job was about.  Once on the floor, all that mattered was sales.  I did great with their customers but was made to be a failure, because of sales goals.  Customers were great to work with, for the most part.  I gained valuable people experience.  Coworkers were great to work with and very nice people."
bad,"stressful environment, prepare yourself to get a layoff even if you worked there for years!! good people to work with. good fundraising and benefits.."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"The highest paid person in the room is always right and new ideas are subject to vetting by those not qualified to do so. It's not a fun place to be if you are are innovative or looking for the ability to positively impact your organization, lots of people just clocking in for the paycheck."
bad,"I had a bad experience working on the retail level at WF due to poor management style. As we all know today, that was a result of extreme pressure from upper management going all the way up to the CEO."
bad,"A typical day is working customer complaints forms and taking incoming customer complaint calls. I have learned that not all banks/credit card companies have the same goals or morals. Management is great and caring. The workplace culture is cliquey and almost like being back in junior high or high school. The hardest part of the job is not being able to always do what is right for the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is my fellow coworkers, benefits and hours of operation."
bad,"Wells Fargo has amazing,resilient clientele, but is not a healthy job environment.  Not all, but some of the management team are willing to overlook certain behaviors for fear of legal action.  Sales goals are ever-changing and there is no stability when it comes to culture. "
bad,Both ng I say here is good so I'm just going to add words until I have enough to skip this. Watch the news if you want to know what it's like there...
bad,"While working at Wells Fargo i had daily anxiety of meeting unrealistic sales goals that trickled down from the top of management. The culture at Wells Fargo is sales, sales, sales"
bad,"Low Moral, culture has become harder and harder as former firms have been merged,  Management seems to be stuck in a rut and not sure how to move forward negative news."
bad,Wells Fargo would be the perfect place to work if they hired people who had the skills to do the job they were assigned.  They have great benefits and give people room to expand their career.
bad,This was a temporary assignment. the company had an excellent cafeteria. the parking was great and the location of the company was excellent. There was no pressure. the temp  company I believe was put in place because the company was merging with another  company and there was jobs that needed to be cleaned up.
bad,The service manager seemed to be the one in charge instead of the branch manager.  There was extreme favoritism displayed by the service manager.  When my concerns were voiced they were not addressed.  All they are concerned about is numbers and sales.
bad,"Wells Fargo is a great company when it comes to benefits for it's employees' As far as the work environment and the comfortability that Wells has to offer. It's horrible! I was never excited to go to work everyday; they really know how to stress a person out. Work was never fun it was all about getting customers in and out while selling a product and providing ""WOW"" service. It was a nearly impossible task to complete. And they definitely don't believe in a person making mistakes."
bad,Wells is a big corporation. Expect the obvious. It is simply a workplace as I can't rave about how great my time was there. Some departments are better than others however. Their mortgage department is not bad for a big bank.
bad,The Executive Resolution Specialist role is the highest level of escalation for the company.  You will have a case load of 20 to sometimes 50 customers that you are working with and their issues are to be resolved within 10 business days.  Very time sensitive and heavily monitored.  Rigorous quality requirements and reviews.
bad,"People are nice, but the split schedules were terrible.  It's very easy to get burned out fast working in the WF call center.  The day shift may be better, but there were very few people who stayed there longer than a couple of months."
bad,"The benefits of the job are the best part of the position, as it is still a call center job. The pay is good also. However, the statistics they expected for sales in a customer service position were strict and some people were let go because they didn't meet numbers that seems to get harder to meet each day. Customers were usually angry made threats, or called with inappropriate approaches. There is a high turn over. Due to some major reveals in business practice, they may have changed some things since then. The training they give you does not prepare you or the actual job itself."
bad,"My least favorite thing about Wells Fargo was the sales quota imposed on the tellers. After referring a customer to a banker, if the banker wasn't able to get the customer to commit to a product, the teller received no credit towards their goal."
bad,Great people to work with and great company to work for. Always was busy but always had time to help each other to get the work completed for customers in time.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Wells Fargo Bank is an good place. The normal day at the bank is normally fast pace. The bank has there regular customers come in two to three time daily. The bank needs to work on team work. Everyone work separately. Management isn't good support system for team. Teller tend to work together but only some time. Banker are nice but lazy. Wells Fargo need a good boost in management. They stop doing sells but now worrying about customer services. Good, no more selling products to customers, no more goals, and no payout. I have worked for Wells Fargo Bank for a year and half. These bank has taught me fast pace, self motivation, team work, sales, and family. The hardest part of the job was balancing every night. Sounds pretty easy but there are much steps and process in taking a teller position at a bank."
bad,You will be overworked and underpaid. Your skills wont be allowed to shine and you will be asked to do last minute things at any given time. They will say thank you and try to always compensate long hours and hard work with food.
bad,I believed in this company when I started but it became a sales only atmosphere. When I started we were their for the customer but when sales become number one thats when I needed to leave.
bad,"Stressful Environment. Required a lot of ""selling"". The managers were constantly monitoring you. You were only allowed to take a break few times in the day."
bad,"Saw more people lose jobs due to family emergencies or management disagreements than anything else. Sales are pushed hard on employees, only saving grace is they give you a bit of time to get up to snuff, you lose your job otherwise, even if it has very little to do with sales. Team leads, Supervisors and department supervisors are basically useless, go above that and your life is pretty easy after that. Typical day for most jobs is irate customers blaming you for the companies mistakes. The workplace culture will feel out of place and fake, Team Leads and Supervisors try really hard to convince themselves it's real. Hardest part of the job is getting out of your car at the start of your shift, after that it's trying to apologize for mistakes on customers accounts without actually saying the words""I'm sorry."". Friends and coworkers will get you through your day and you may find a gem among the trash of supervisors, if that happens I recommend never leaving that position, the frustration and self loathing is not worth the extra .50$ an hour."
bad,"When it was Wachovia, it was all about the employee and customer. When it was Wells Fargo, it became numbers only and not about the employee. You didn't have a life because you were expected to be there all hours to complete the work. You never knew what type of work schedule you would have on any given day. You could work a typical 8-12 hour shift and not be given any type of notice. It was expected that you be there until the shift was done. Managers didn't care just had to do the work"
bad,"Productive and opportunities for advancement, Health insurance not the best, focused around customer service. Training and coaching available at all job or positions level."
bad,"It was great meeting new people from all over the world and building rapport with them. It was also a tight-knit, family oriented type of environment at the branch. However, the goals were merely unattainable at times. I enjoy a good challenge from time to time, but the goals there for the Bankers and tellers were unrealistic mostly. This company has been under much scrutiny as they have had several lawsuits from both customers as well as former employees."
bad,This company is lacking in management.  The pay is very low and not worth the overpriced benefits. No position is secure and management will not inform you if your position is ending.
bad,Wells Fargo call center was not an enjoyable work experience for me. There were long hours of sitting and the job was not very easy. I was a collector. Steady paycheck.
bad,"Company was not run on a friendly basis.   People only were concerned about ""what's in it for me"".    If you had a question, good luck finding someone to help you."
bad,good place to start your career and develop a solid foundation of the financial services industry. you can use this knowledge to move ahead in your career
bad,"Responsible for responding to written and phone inquiries from customers, title companies and internal and external customers regarding loans"
bad,The way the point system is setup is confusing and limited. There supervisor do not have the back of their team members they allow you to be verbally abused by their customers.
bad,"Not what you expect for management, very difficult to move up in the position. Also undisclosed job duties, wouldn't refer this company to an enemy."
bad,I wasn't with the company long enough to even give an accurate review. I was the oldest person in the teller line. I was only there 3 months before UHC called me to work full time.
bad,"This company has the right idea and the policies are where they need to be.  That being said, I have little faith in management ability.  I have worked for two stores at this point and i have seen great managers and i have seen horrible ones as well.  I feel that upper management recognizes achievements by people who do not deserve credit.  Just not a big fan of this company."
bad,This was a large bank headquartered in Chicago.  It bought LaSalle bank and headquartered its north american base in chicago.  i worked in the audit department.
bad,"Time management and efficiency were crucial to perform my job well, I also had the opportunity to learn how to build rapport with customers in a short period of time."
bad,"Usually no support for personal/professional development (unless it is about how many accounts you sell).  Very disappointed. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,I am not ready to comment on this position at this time. I will comment when and if a proposed employer asks. Thank you very much.
bad,"There is not a lot of flexibility and  there is no work life balance. However, it is a pleasure to work with customers and provide a great customer service."
bad,"A typical day at work was hectic, but most customers where great and understanding. The store manager was nice, the assistant manager played favorites, not very helpful, super pushy. co workers where great though some tried to dump the work on others while they sat around. The hardest part of the job was trying to advance, however management played favorites and if they did not like you, you would not even get a recommendation. The most enjoyable part of the job was providing customer service."
bad,"They do not offer more hours to tellers. The max is only 25 hours. They have high expectations, yet offer so little. Takes a long time to get promoted. They force sales on customers, even if the customer says they are not interested. They do not have steady schedules. Five hours a day is a waste of time and gas money."
bad,"That's basically it, it was fun getting to know the customers and establishing a relationship with all of them, but when it all boiled down to the managers, they were just numbers, attempted sales and if you're not trying, you don't have job security."
bad,condescending atmosphere and a lack of training.  Manager went of maternity leave a week after I started and the office was left without clear direction.
bad,This position requires training ata 9-5 location whick then locates y9ou into store for three daays with no contact only monitoring . Once you are pastthat stage work and customer sales exist
bad,i worked in a negative environment where a employee had it out for lots of people very disrespectful head manager did nothing but treated him better... We were under a lot of pressure to sell things to customer that they didn't need .. short staffed and having to do work that was not in our position to do
bad,"I had been working at Wells Fargo for about 2 years and as the months/years went by it just got worst than ever. I was a top performer everyday i had put my all into what i do while meeting high goals. It's already stressful enough with people yelling at you. Half of the management doesn't even know anything and pressure everyone to meet sales goals. I am now looking for another job, this call center has poor business skills and do not care about their employees!!"
bad,Strict company with managers that should not be in charge. Job performance barely mattered because managers had their favorites and gave them special treatment.
bad,A typical work day consisted of helping customer via telephone with various concerns they may have encountered.  The management micro-managed giving little if any leeway for growth or any improvements on processes.  Co-Workers job were the best part of the job.  The hardest part of the job was the actual management dealing with unnecessary attitude and the feeling as if you could not go to them for help.
bad,Overall a good company. My department in Mortgage always has ups and downs which is part if the overall mortgage territory. So when business is slow jobs are low.
bad,great benefits good people but they constantly make changes and give you an insane work load and everyone quits and you get more work to do and you go crazy and check into a psych ward just kidding but not really
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of interview with borrower for options with home preservation, repayment plans, analyzing borrower's financial situation and making recommendations to resolve delinquency. I would also do conference calls with underwriters and  borrower to clarify hardship financial situation, create letters to send to borrowers/or agencies to collect documents , help clear title issues, and communicate decisions to borrowers, agencies and authorized third parties. I learned that the Home Preservation position was challenging at times with the heartbreaking stories but was a very rewarding position. My co-workers were supportive. The hardest part of my job there was not being able to offer solutions for borrowers that did not qualify for any workout options. The most enjoyable part of the job was hearing how grateful the borrowers were  to be helped. The paid time off for voluntary work was fun and rewarding."
bad,"Greeting customers and helping them with their issues and questions, I have learned a lot about preparing your finances for you and your family, being prepared financially and preparing for retirement."
bad,i liked the job it was just some of the employers that made the experience difficut. wells fargo themselves as a company is pretty good tho
bad,"The company company does not value the associates, you and the customers are looked at as numbers.On paper what they do is great but at the end of the day you are not valued, easily replaced."
bad,Work Bankrupcty cases with two 15min breaks and one 30min break for lunch. Repeat Monday-Friday. A typical work day would be working 10-30 overlook then to send to the next team.
bad,Politics trumps all. Politics dictated whether any fun could be squeezed. Micromanagement became the defining characteristic
bad,Job paid very low and not room to grow unless you take advantage of the customers selling them unnecessary products.  Would not work for this company again
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"I work there for so many years and they don't like to hire on, they will keep you as a temp before they hire you on into their company. Overall the people that you work with is by better then the company. Great team work but just not to good of a company to me. I don't think they notice at you are a hard worker. "
bad,"Very tight ship ran, all about numbers and how quick you can get through tasks and not at all worried about the consumer.  Too many pieces of the puzzle trying to come together at once instead of having 1 person take care of the whole process."
bad,"Great team, Managers as well. Not a lot of room to grow. Competing against other branches fun. Win prizes they care about employees."
bad,the most rewarding is helping customers with their financial need and working together as a team. the co- workers become family because your around them all the time. The hardest part about the job is feeling like your being pressured every day to meet sale goals. the customer don't feel like customer they feel like numbers.
bad,I enjoyed my job at Wells Fargo but it is the most stressful place I have ever worked for. I have completely loved every other job I have had so I guess it was my turn to have a stressful job. I can adjust to any job I can sit there and not talk put earplugs in and work all day and leave at days end. Or if I have a job that allows you to speak and joke little with team members to have a fun working environment I can do that also. I do what I need to have a job but much prefer a fun job and if that's you Wells Fargo is not the place.
bad,"Wear multiple hats. Very busy office. Work inside and outside the office. Visit real estate offices. Work with realtors, banks, title and escrow company."
bad,I worked for wells fargo for 3 years. I honestly did not like the culture of the company. They want to work you hard and long with little pay.
bad,"Previously, I worked within two high-volume customer-support and national business centers for a Verizon Wireless. In these positions, I demonstrated the ability to resolve a variety of issues and complaints (such as billing disputes, service interruptions or cutoffs, large national account contracts and profile building to ensure uniformity.   I consistently met my call-volume goals, handling an average of 45 to 60 calls per day."
bad,"The work place is basically separated into clicks.  It's not a place that you really get noticed for the work you do, but who you know and are friends with."
bad,"Management is so desperate to meet sales goals they will over work you in order to achieve it. The amount of work you will put in every single day is not worth the pay at all. Lots of standing, for 11-12 hours a day working full time, and if you sit down, you will get talked to about how its unprofessional. You will get one 30 minute break for lunch and that's it. This job will drain you not only physically, but mentally. Management at the store I work at will yell at you if you mess up and treat you like you're stupid even when you first start. H"
bad,A typical day at work is trying to find many ways to entice customers to buying into Wells Fargo and staying a customer.  You will learn how to become an aggressive seller at Wells Fargo.  Your co-workers may stoop to low levels in order to cover themselves.  The hardest part of the job is stressing over goals each day.
bad,"Compensation is not great, however the benefits are awesome. A typical day at work is too repetitive. Great place to learn but set your own goals and challenge yourself."
bad,"IO couldve swore I already did this review. But anyways. Really high stress. Really high sales goals that were nearly impossible to meet. I loved my peer coworkers, but the management was absolutely terrible. If you didn't reach your insane daily sales goal every day you would never hear the end of it."
bad,They were dishonest in telling me about the job they hired me for. I worked in 2 dept. and both were poorly ran with poor service.
bad,"A typical day at work has me doing several things at once.  I am in the administrative field, at a desk, handling phone calls from customers and working with customers in person.  I have intense demand to reconcile, to investigate payment processing, handling mail, spreadsheets, filing and working a 8-6.  I love to work with people and never had issues with managers because i put in 110%.  The most difficult part of my job would have been the ability to keep busy.  The most enjoyable part is the investigate, such as researching a payment received but not posted to the correct account."
bad,Very sales driven with unrealistic goals. I love helping customers and making them smile. I have learned alot about the world of finan
bad,"I usually loved my job because of the customers and co-workers. I learned a lot about how big companies treat their employees. The stress that was placed on us to ""sale"" products and services was unrealistic and the worst part of our daily job. I really loved being able to help the customers and hopefully make their day a little better. I really learned how to interact with people in various situations."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Great resources and training to advance in the company quickly.  Aggressive sales roles that is measured by quantity not quality.
bad,Its an ok job if you are looking to for another job. Typical 9-6 job. Pays the bills. I would hate to stay a Personal Banker. Incentives are weak.
bad,I worked at Wachovia before it changed to Wells Fargo. It seemed like a typical banking job but I am not sure what Wells is currently like.
bad,"The managers are very nice here, and I had the oppurtunity to go to a few different departments, I will say that the company itself does need a little upgrading as far as sick leave, medical leave among a few other necessary things to keep there employees loyal."
bad,Processed and submitted loans to Underwriting Department daily and collected conditions per Underwriter approval.
bad,Was a great company when i started then our customers started to be just an account number.  Management was not on the right page.
bad,"good customer service, making specific sales goals."
bad,"Productive place to work, a lot of favoritism by management to employees who are lazy and not productive, awards were awarded to managers pets while clearly the numbers and production of these employees spoke different, changes were implemented spontaneously, and employees were given 45 min to an hour of training on a training that would normally take 6 - 8 weeks."
bad,"Please ask me in person about my thoughts on Wells Fargo. A typical day is spent profiling customers, looking for sales opportunities and selling them on any product they don't already have with the company. It's robotic and designed to get the customer in as much debt and cause as many fees as possible. They say it's a sales job, but of all the tremendously hard work I do, including being ranked as the top banker in the district, we are poorly compensated for our abilities."
bad,"This was a very stressfull dead end job.  There is room for advancement if you can stay there long enough, are a ""yes"" person, and are in the right clique.  There is always room for advancement because the leads, supervisors, and managers are always quitting or being fired for not meeting their metrics.  The stress came from angry customers who Online Banking service was not working and by management shoving sales goals on you."
bad,Read a lot of papers and reviewed documents for errors. Worked with different realtors from different parts of the country
bad,"Assist in answering phone calls to the credit union while providing excellent service to members. Provide account information by phone, as well as information on the full range of credit union products and services. Provide a variety of transaction services to members. Resolve issues and professionally handled the member’s daily needs."
bad,"Working with this company was great to start, then when production slowed down they were just as quick to lay everyone off."
bad,Companies incentive program almost punishes  employees for working harder than others. Management isn't very honest with the employees.
bad,Hard work and bad hours.  The beginning positions are really the bottom of the barrel.
bad,Wells Fargo pays very well but works you like if your not human and only care about sales. They do not care at all about the customer or team members. All they care about is sales and are very racial when it comes to getting a promotion and Human Resources does nothing when you call to let them know about an incident someone made you feel uncomfortable in even if it was racial.
bad,Each position and manager is different. You as an employee would need to judge for yourself.
bad,the company was good the office had to many rules you couldnt breath without getting written up.
bad,Monthly goals are the same as quarterly goals at other places
bad,Laidoff when management could not effectively handle budgets and forecasting.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"If sales drives you, working in a branch as a banker or a teller would be a great fit."
bad,"As a lead teller at Wells Fargo, I took care of basic transactions for customers as well as supervised and assisted others with transactions and sales ."
bad,Even though they have the latest and greatest tech at hand they insist on ancient practices like no remote work and hardly any modern managerial practices in place
bad,Most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to learn new things everyday.
bad,I worked at night sometimes we would be short om people and I would try to make sure all the women bathrooms that was on my run were cleaned.
bad,"Retail banking at its best.  Sales, sales, sales.  I am not fond of sales nor do I aspire to be a salesman."
bad,"Wells fargo is a great place to work for , I enjoy working with customers and help them with their banking needs."
bad,"A typical day at work is crazy hectic. From cash services shipments every morning to manifest and reports at night. Management does not acknowledge all of the duties of their tellers and how important it is that things are done so that the branch is able to run smoothly. Wells Fargo is sales based and pushes products/services on customers. My co-workers were amazing and considered them family. All were hard workers and helped out where ever they were needed. Management not so much. The hardest part of the Job at Wells Fargo is trying to live up to the outrageous expectations of the district manager. I really enjoyed meeting different customers and hearing their stories, helping them succeed financially, and being able to put a smile on someone's face."
bad,"See Review summary for details.  Expectations were set very, very high and compensations bonus was very little."
bad,"Inbound phone calls"
bad,It's a typical corportate law department...Very laid back work environment. People are friendly. Just wasn't any job stability for me as a contract worker
bad,Wells Fargo is completely sales oriented. They tell you in training that they want to do what best for the customer but when you are on the floor what they really want is for you to open 10 accounts for the same person. It doesn’t matter if that person needs it or not.
bad,"The job and co-workers were good. The commute from Winston-Salem to Raleigh everyday was unsustainable. The job was typical, cubicles, computer, ect. The hardest part of the job was learning new computer software. I was initally trained on the new platform which was still under construction. After training, the decision was made to have me work production under their old platform. I got some classroom training on site then a couple of days observing an underwriter. The system was antiquated and tough to learn with no experience. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with my co-workers."
bad,"As a teller at Wells Fargo you will be expected to do two things. Provide customer service to the point where customers are uncomfortable, and sell products to customers that they don't need. Managers will hover over your shoulder at all times making sure you are conforming to their model with an example being KDM's. The entire job is stressful beyond belief, and the best part about the job is conversing with your fellow team members, if you so happen to get along with each other. Overall Wells Fargo doesn't take care of their employees as well as their customers."
bad,"A very loving and warm place to work. I work with a team of outstanding people, dedicated to helping people. not only do we save homes we save lives."
bad,"Training at Wells Fargo is lacking.  If you are very experienced, you can get loans closed.  The LOS is very old school and still DOS based."
bad,"Wells Fargo was very good at rewarding employees for their hard work. My department was a bit unorganized due to the quick merge from Wachovia to Wells Fargo. Throughout my employment, I started off as On line Support and once the merger took place I was forced to become a Personal Banker/Sales Representative. I had no background in sales and was trained a total of 2 days to do so. This was difficult for me as technical support was always something of my interest and sales was not. When attempting to transfer out into a different department, in order to avoid quitting Wells Fargo, I was told my profile was flagged because of not meeting my sales goal. Although I tried as hard as I could, I was terminated by department manager whom later ended up getting demoted. Although the termination may not have been the ""right"" or the ""ethical"" way of doing things, it allowed me to see that there are better opportunities for me out there in the career world and I ended up being more successful than ever before. Wells Fargo itself is a great company to work for, especially if you are great at sales. The department I was in just needed better management, and better training. If I had children, I would be in a bit of trouble if emergencies happened as not employees were allowed FAMILY TIME."
bad,"Fun place to work mostly because of the customers. Management was horrible, not well organized. Very focused on sales but not performing the job in a professional manner."
bad,"Great management team."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,I felt as though this department was a bit disorganized.  The lack of sufficient training left employees with no guidance or direction.
bad,"I was hired to cure title defects on refinance loans after closing. My manager kept telling me they were going to bring me on as a permanent employee and they were going to open up a requisition for me. Months and months passed and he kept reassuring me... I received many accolades and never missed any work. However, as everyone who works here will tell you- a contract position will never be permanent. They string you along thinking that maybe one day you will be offered a full time position, but it simply is not true. You get zero benefits- no health insurance, no PTO, not even paid holidays until you work for the staffing agency for a certain amount of time. Then when your contract expires, you are out looking for another job. The longest contract they offer is 18 months and it is never extended."
bad,A typical day at Wells Fargo is making sure you provide great customer service to every customer. Also to upsale products let the customers know about all the different products Wells Fargo offer.
bad,No work life balance alot of OT and coworkers with questionable work ethic.
bad,I was let go due to poor performance during training.  I never had a proper peer mentor like my other new hires but I had around 6 people teaching me one thing there way.  Management micro managed and constantly kept listening into my calls and not the other trainees.  The associates were great though very friendly and always encouraged me but management needs to learn how to work with people and not just throw them out and fire them
bad,It is a not good company to work for. Typical day is full of customer complaints.  It is a hostile work environment I would not refer anyone to work in the sales department.
bad,"The people you work with are great, the work is easy. The upper management is not the best."
bad,"In my department I work reports that come into our que. If a banker suspects that elder abuse is occurring they fill out a form, and it is sent to my department electronically. From there I fine tune the report before sending to Adult Protective Services. I answer phones, and update files when needed."
bad,"Great company but was hired as a temp assignmet.  Under the assignment we were allowed to work 12 to 18 months and then had to wait a 6 month period before reapplying."
bad,I personally didnt have problems with this Employer. However I saw it crumbling down when a hand full of ppl. started getting fired for not selling.
bad,"Poor management, company doesn't care about their customers and most definitely they don't care about their employees all their concerned about is sales sales sales! (which is increased every year)"
bad,Didn't really enjoy the mortgage business. I enjoy more of a range of responsibilities with my work
bad,"Wells Fargo does offer great benefits. They promote within, but this means there are always positions to fill and new people in new positions. They stress the importance of excellent customer service but sometimes high sales goals make it hard to provide that excellent service."
bad,"I am part of the 2300 emplyees to be laid off as of Sept 14, 2013"
bad,Wells Fargo's management does not exhibit any ethics at all.
bad,This was one the most stressful places I have worked. Benefits were great!
bad,You have to try and sell financial packages to customers.. nobody wants to get a new bank account!
bad,The processing/underwriting departments struggle to close loans in a timely manner.
bad,"	Accurately balanced cash drawer, performed superior customer service which resulted in receiving perfect scores on my evaluation."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,The company had a great reputation and very friendly people. I had no idea that I was employed by a bank that was failing.
bad,"I have nothing good to say about this company, so I will say nothing."
bad,"Advancement and benefits are very easily attained through the bank. There is a bit of shuffling with positions, but everyone is given a chance to succeed and move up."
bad,A typical day was doing whatever it takes to meet daily sales quotas at any cost. I learned that it's better to leave a company than to be forced to be unethical. The management was poorly educated. My co-workers were always under heavy stress. The hardest part of the job was feeling like a statistic rather than a human. The most enjoyable part was good pay to live a decent standard of life.
bad,"Typically Monday thru Friday the job was fine goals are easy to make. The hardest part of this job is not in positioning solutions for opportunities for consumers but in producing widgets that don't add value for the consumer. This must be done in order to keep your job it may help in the short run but never in the long. Problems are created like funding rates, avoidable consumer fees and increased goals to do the production of widgets."
bad,I liked working for Wells Fargo however it is hard to get rewarded for consistent hard work and they do not promote within a department.
bad,"For the most part I enjoyed working there, but there turned out to be no job security. The benefits were good."
bad,"Poor support and communication between production and processing departments. Management at odds and ineffectual. Business, relationships and production suffered due to inability of different departments and their management's failed efforts to cooperate."
bad,"I was an employee of AG Edwards which was bought by Wachovia then Wells Fargo in St. Louis. Wachovia leadership is still running the Securites division of WF. Wachovia treated the legacy employees of AGE terrible though there were several general sessions stating we would work together and find the best practice which never happen. Now bought by WF, the former Wachovia employees only care about their legacy employees. 90% of the AGE employees were let go..Now they only state what others want to hear but never follow through.WF did bring great benefits but the atmosphere in STL is chaotic and expect you to work 40 plus hours and weekends. No work/life balance. Though if you were hired from outside, the new employee is treated better than the original legacy AGE employee. Only thing STL has going for it are great buildings, cafeteria and gym with wonderful benefits otherwise the leadership is very hostile."
bad,"When trying to rate this I was not able to cliGck on the stars as I wanted. Overall Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. Great benefits, and great people."
bad,"HR doesn’t help as much as they make you believe, I was bullied for months and no amount of proof (text messages, witnesses) would get them to intervene. The coworker didn’t get fired until she started using racial slurs at other coworkers and customers. Shouldn’t have even gotten that far, but she had been unpunished for so long she got extra brave."
bad,"They lie about everything. No room for growth or advancement. They promote from within is also a lie. Despite them saying they need people they come back constantly saying they want someone with branch experience but they don't say that in the job posting. One supervisor continually ruined my shot at advancing and despite having good numbers and being a top employee, stuck in same "
bad,I was a remote worker for San Francisco office working out of Seattle office.  I didn’t care for all banking regulations required when I was in the insurance division.
bad,Stressful no one seems to have a grasp on how things should go a lot of misinformation given traing is a joke! People were ok but very busy overwhelmed have to work ot in order to finish work everyday and sometimes saturdays some teams do not work as hard as others and we have to bail them out having to talk to car dealerships is a pain never have what is needed and fight you every step of the way
bad,They are very focused on numbers and the salary raises are very low per year. One year they gave us .20cts. The good part of the job was that we did not worry about the benefits that were available.
bad,"Hated my manager, but the overall job was as expected to be a teller. Repetitive work environment. I was a young associate working with older employees. It was difficult to find my niche."
bad,"Over hired, no opportunity to advance, full time employees treat you like second class citizens, Wells Fargo mmgt. was great, however, the hiring agency is way too overbearing"
bad,"Working for Wells Fargo was stressful. There were many times that mandatory overtime required me to work 50-60 hour work weeks.  Sales are mandatory, even though your job as customer service shouldn't be focused on sales."
bad,"Every second of your day was accounted for. Too many rules and regulations. Although the ability to climb the corporate ladder was very attainable, the work environment was so stale and boring that I could not stand it for longer than a year!"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,The job is relax and fast paced . I just feel like working for Wells Fargo for 13 years I should be making more in pay. Work perform is above perform.
bad,The position I held while I was there as a whole was fine. But they wanted you to sell products to there customers that they didn't need. I refused to do that and I was fired. Later as a company they were in trouble for doing that very thing too there customers.
bad,The calls are horrible unless you work for the entitled more wealthy clients and even then it's not a peach. That would be fine and tolerable if the management knew how to run a call center. They also have a demanding Average Handle Time that prevents you from truly helping clients with money saving strategies. Too greedy and soulless company.
bad,Closed our site to out our jobs to overseas. Wells Fargo raises weren’t much of anything neither. Got a 13cent raise first year and a 28 cent raise the second year even though I was a top performer.
bad,"Pay is great but poor management "
bad,The base salary was not enough to pay your bills. You had to hit targeted goals to get any type of bonus in order to have a reasonable standard of living.
bad,I was a tenured manager and truly loved my job.  The culture changed and from an ethical standpoint it became difficult to feel good about my job. I as one person could not make the changes that I knew had to be made.
bad,Not a great job either. It was very monotonous and micromanaged. Very sales driven when it wasn't even a sales job. Had some great coworkers but the turnover rate was very high.
bad,"The manager-specific team I work on it fantastic, however the overall company culture is awful. Micromanagement, blame shifting, and poor company image all contribute to an awful organizational culture at Wells Fargo."
bad,"Wells Fargo is decent company to work for, just felt their ways and ethics didn't coexist with me and character. Loved the people I worked with great staff."
bad,"-great day, great co workers "
bad,At my particular branch I just feel as if there isn't enough structure. Which is slightly understandable for a big company with a recent past like Wells Fargo with all the changes in protocols and the recently fired and newly hired team members. I can see they're still seeing what needs to be done and avoided. Other then that its a great company to work for and they truly care for their team members.
bad,Working for Wells Fargo can have its ups and downs. They offer benefits and the whole 9 yards. Management supports you and suggests you to move up within the company.
bad,A typical day in my position includes a high volume of calls; managing high stress levels as some clients have deeper issues with their banking; management is flexible and compassionate about the company; hardest part of the job is being yelled at by clients regularly when they are calling in for assistance; most enjoyable part of the job are the people I get to work with as they make the stress tolerable.
bad,Terrible company. Great management. Room for advancement but and even relocation but a lot of pressure on selling things for company profit that customer's may not need. A lot of force and targeting of people who ae usually financially secure with no help to customer's in need .
bad,"Management has opportunity for growth in the area of being more personable with the team members and treating everyone with dignity and respect. Working with the team members and assisting with HR issues is very fulfilling, although not being compensated fairly for the type of work or positions held is not as fulfilling as there were a lot of great, hard working team members who left the company due to this."
bad,Always have fun with new learning experience. Always short staff but have more stress day. The hardest part was not a good coaching  about new products and work hard for achieve weekly goal.
bad,"Learn a lot of educational things about financing, sales and marketing. The compensation and incentive plan is good as well."
bad,"I believe that it is a great company to work for under a good management. If you work at a branch and see about 10 employees quit and others come and go in less than 2 years, then you know that there is a missing piece."
bad,As a teller you're just kind of standing there helping customers all day. Everything is scripted so you're pretty much saying the same thing to every customer. Fake a smile and perky attitude all day. If you have a good management team you're good. A lot of pressure as far as sales pretty much have to sell to every customer ( most customer don't like that but Wells Fargo doesn't really care) But if you like fast paced work environment and easy work this is for you and it can be fun at times. Management tries their best to keep their employees engaged which is cool.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,Wells Fargo has been an excellent place to gain experience and grow as a professional. Due lots of turnover there will always be opportunity to grow in this competitive work environment. I personally think the compensation does not suit the work case load I personally handle.
bad,"I learned advanced mortgage underwriting and mastered the various mortgage products offered by Wells Fargo. Typical day involved reviewing paystubs, W-2's and personal and business tax returns to calculate borrower's income for qualification purposes. In addition, reviewed asset statements, sales contracts , credit reports and appraisals to verify meets all underwriting guidelines. On a daily basis, consulted borrowers, attorneys and closing agents to ensure timely closing of mortgage and to ensure closing was smoothly completed. "
bad,I would answer phones all day long and help people with their shares/stocks accounts.  Anything from just an account check to how they go about selling or trading their shares.
bad,"Wells Fargo as a bank on the East coast is till trying to establish a corporate culture. Upper management is abysmal but middle management was both supportive and encouraging. The job itself is what you make of it, as much of it rests on your abilities to sell. Surprisingly, for a company that stresses teamwork, your success is decided almost exclusively by the work you put in. "
bad,"Origination, process, underwrite and close all mortgage programs."
bad,"Most of the call center atmosphere revolved around whether each member on every team was referring the correct amount of products and services to customers in addition to warm transferring them to the sales department to have more accounts opened. Although team supervisors would inform their team members of the importance of excellent customer service during meetings held in conference rooms, when on the floor supervisors would often push team members to concentrate on referring products or services to the sales team to cut call time down, and maintain sales goal percentages. "
bad,Unethical standards and ridiculous expectations. Management gets away with allowing these types of ethics as long as numbers are being met. I wouldn't suggest being employed there in any sort of sales position.
bad,"I don't know if it is just my district or what the deal is but Wells Fargo makes me feel like I could lose my job *any* second if the wrong person decides they don't like me. The sales quotas seem unattainable unless you give in to immorality and bad ethics. All of the regular staff I have met are some of the greatest people; fun, charismatic, social, they all know how to have a good time. It's sad sometimes to see new bright faces come into the workplace and slowly lose a piece of their honesty as times go on."
bad,"If you like being tied to a phone its fine. Lax dress code, nice people, the actual job is tedious and very boring."
bad,"Being a teller was less fun than I anticipated. You are not only required to exchange money or make deposits, but management tends to pressure you to make SALES SALES SALES, open accounts for people, get them to use every Wells Fargo product (or service) in existence. Unless you're a natural salesman, or inordinately outgoing and exuberant, it can become quite draining."
bad,Good benefits and lot's of different areas to move into but their system treats customers like garbage who will in turn treat you like garbage.  You get all holidays off or at least pto instead if you have to work them.
bad,"If you enjoy customer service, it's a great place to work. They don't pay enough for what you have to remember for audits and it can be stressful and overwhelming. I enjoyed working there. The employees there need to work on being better communicators to team members and not talk at the other team members like they are better than anyone who works there."
bad,I would never work for this company again. stressful environment and commission was okay for customer care position. they hire from within so moving up is an option.
bad,"I worked in a Phone Bank Located in Shoreview, MN. The call center has amazing set of coworkers and managers. The only negative thing that I can say about the whole process is I feel like Phone Bankers should be paid alittle more than whats  offered."
bad,I loved everyone I worked with except management was overly rude. Pay was not worth the hours. Every branch is different really enjoyed the first few I worked at.
bad,A typical day at work would start out smooth and slow then progress into a stressful chaotic  place. management only cares about the numbers you are suppose to make and they didn't really do much one on one until it affected them.
bad,Wells pays well above average and tries to be a great company. They just do not know how to be a great company. It is not a place for those who require accomplishment.
bad,It was basically a call center and you were talking to a bunch of angry people. I did not feel like I got paid enough to be talked to and treated the way that I was by the card holders. I felt like I was lying in order to get what they wanted.
bad,The department was slow on work and they fired anyone for anything because the department had lack of work to do. I would not recommend to anyone. I was fired when I was in the hospital for a kidney infection.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Good Work Life Balance, Good PAy, Flexible, Not much to learn as uses old technologies, CAb services, Good Culture, Fun at work"
bad,"The issue I have is with management they really don't know anything, and if your not in a clique you won't advance period."
bad,"I really loved helping customers the overall atmosphere was great I loved working on the team, I really didn't like how unsecure they are"
bad,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew and it was more difficult to get to know the new people. There was a lot of variety in what I did each day, ranging from the monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting."
bad,Working for Wells Fargo has a good culture but just the people that manages the district and the stores are the one who runes the environment for every employee. Everyday is dealing with the same thing. Having the store manager pressuring you to do unethical thing is always a constant thing.
bad,"Unfortunately I do not have a great deal of good things to say about working for retail banking. Training was poor, the management only cares about getting solutions. While I was there 2 employees was caught stealing. Not a good place to work at all!"
bad,"ability to travel to different states with  company. pay is very good, ability to grow in company through college reimbursement"
bad,"You will learn a bunch, but if you do not mean your goals you are done. They do have a high turn over due to the sales issue. They have ask the customer 3 times for them to get a product before they leave rule."
bad,"Great thing about Wells Fargo is pay is great they offer overtime if u stay in task it will be fine but, the bad thing is some of the employees jealousy I got led go over some jealousy so if u stay to yourself u will be just fine if not u will be let go cause there is some mean people in the Eagan location and I will not go back"
bad,"The salary,  benefits, and commissions were great. The goals, and expectations were very drastic and management and dealing with out side life were not consistant."
bad,"Managed an executable docs team of 11 affiants and notary team members who created and published data elements for new processes."
bad,"it was not a good expierance for me,i was a only full timer has to open & close everyday..im a single mother in that years which i was worked there was not happy place to work for me....im a people person love customer servies but wells fargo dose not have that ..."
bad,"It's all about the money, they don't seem to care how their employees feel or the customers. Employees and customers have to adjust to the banks wants  with a smile on their face despite knowing it's immorally wrong to some level."
bad,"I have been enjoying how much the company has been gearing more towards all about the customer. The branch I worked at was very slow and it was easy to figure everything out. I did not appreciate the management, young manager not willing to listen to the team members when we have suggestions or problems.They say they are willing to help you out with your schedule conflicts but they whine and complain if you have any and say sorry can't help you with this. It is a very simple job as a teller and you can easily find ways to move up but that is if you are wanting to really move up in this financial world of wonder."
bad,"Great Networking  and opportunities of the business! Great hours and time off. Work, Life, balance outreach programs and working with the community. Easily to relocate across the country."
bad,"At my particular branch, the team is beyond great. They're fun to work with, and they're always supportive of each others goals."
bad,"Days are spent running transactions, directing incoming calls, and helping customers with their banking needs. I've learned that many people don't know enough about banking to better maximize their earnings and savings. Management could be better. Hardest part is dealing with angry and entitled customers; most enjoyable is finding a banking solution that will better serve a customer need."
bad,Typical big corporation attitude.  It is all about the number of sales you have versus customer service.  This company is hard to work for if people are important to you.
bad,"Monday-thursday 8:30-5:15"
bad,"great benefits nationwide - you can transfer anywhere ability to move on tuition reimbursement 401K don't need a college degree to apply or to move up the ladder"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Expectations are high, can be overwhelming. Team members were great to work with and helpful. Training does not fully prepare you for how the job will be on the floor."
bad,"The pay is good starting off as well as with raises/benefits. The major downfall of this job is the amount of time you spend on the phone taking calls from either very rude and upset customers who don't let you solve their problem in a timely manner and you get in trouble for it, or you get slow callers who want to spend all day on a subject or for the life of them do not know how their smart phone, computer or anything works and you have to be here step by step to help them but you also get in trouble for that. Stressful job, not worth the awesome benefits. FACT: over HALF of the staff at the call center location i worked in last year was on medical leave for their mental health. This company made me change my career path to avoid big corporate jobs in the future. Not worth it. The embodiment of ""If you were to die today your job would have a replacement for you by tomorrow."""
bad,"They took my operations manager position and moved it 2 hours from my home leaving me no choice but to quit after 20 years in that position."
bad,I was very happy with the progress that i made with Well Fargo but not very happy of the turnout.  There was no backbone within the company and would not support their employees.
bad,Company is too aggressive in sales. A lot of sales experience can be gain if you are willing to learn from your managers. A lot of cold calls after work hours with aggressive sales approach. Be ready to be upset and frustrated. Sales goals are very high. People are numbers. Micromanagement. If you can make it longer than a year without loosing self respect you get used to it. Think twice before you apply. Good Luck! Welcome to the misery!
bad,I fell this company focuses on high dollar clients while making the goals for their employess very high. It was very difficult to feel valued as a Teller and maintain the high energy toward clients because of the high demands. I don't believe the company values all clients equily. I felt new employees were often thrown into their roles too quickly creating a discomfort amongst employees. There was too much pressure on making our numbers for the profit of the company forcing poor client service.
bad,"- each day varies upon stress level ranging from 1-10  ten being the highest. A typical day at Wells can range in a stress level between 7-10. "
bad,I learned a lot about finances and how to be a great leader. I had to be multi-tasked.
bad,take many calls per day. learn how to do banking over the phone. manager was new and let me go despite him not really knowing me and me working there 24yrs and was well liked by everyone. workplace was diverse. hardest part was taking many calls per day. most enjoyable part was the co workers you had
bad,taking lots of  incoming calls just did don't like the part where you had to make a sell to every caller and no breaks in between calls made it stressful.
bad,I love it here people company love their employer give you time off work in case of family death. great benefits. you work on the clock meaning u get tardy if you are 1 min off you schedule time
bad,No typical day
bad,FAP program helps you gain exposure to top leaders in the industry. There is really good training experiences as well with yearly FAP financial training courses.
bad,Great place to work good life balance. Management is good and the people are friendly and develop great relTIONSHIPS. bENEFITS WERE EXCELLENT AND THEY HAVE A GREAT 401K PLAN .
bad,"Okay place to work. As a banker, goal were rigorous. Could sometimes feel forceful in process of providing process of recommendations and financial review for customers."
bad,"I enjoyed working in a team, gathering together and reaching our sale goals. the management at the time was decent, our team was in between managers.  the hardest part of my job was dealing with irate customers but I was one of the best quoted team member for dealing with ""angry customers"".  The easiest part of my job was catering the call and meeting my daily sale goals."
bad,"Liked what I did, very demanding and every move was counted, just like you would expect a bank to do."
bad,"Wells Fargo outsourced my job to Manila offering me a relocation to Arizona, which was unacceptable since I would have to take a huge pay cut and leave my family to go.  Most of the management there is not good, as they are dishonest with employees for the most part.  My direct supervisor was wonderful and supportive and really cared about me and my counterparts however she was not the norm."
bad,I tried to transfer companies to colorado and was denied. They decided that they was just going to let me go during my  two week notice after 3 years of bing there.
bad,"Providing excellent customer service by assisting customer with online inquiries such as password reset,bill pay claim and also building a value relationship with customers"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
bad,"Its a good place to work at, I wasn’t able to relocate."
bad,"there is room for advancement, management needs to be more professional if you become dedicated you can move up fast and make the job into a career"
bad,I enjoyed working at wells fargo it was a fun place to work the management was nice and there is a lot of room for advancement in the company.
good,"Good place to work which is completely based on the project and the team and also very nice place to work with good work life balance."
good,helped people with loan origination for  mortgages. I knew nothing about loan origination and received very little education on the products/loan types.
good,This job was so nerve wrecking.  It didn't matter how hard you worked.  The favorites always got it easy while the actual hard workers were constantly told you'd be fired if you didn't work hard. The managers are horrible and the regional managers had no idea what they were talking about because they were outsourced.  People that broke the rules and got high sales were loved.  You were almost looked down at if you didn't do shady stuff to make your sales.  It sucked being someone that played by the rules but I don't regret it.  Many shady bankers and tellers are now managers and corporate.
good,"The collectors were segregated based on who the supervisors liked and didn't like. If you were a poor collector you were ignored and black balled for any type of office recognition or advancements. The management team were involved in shady practices behind the scenes with incentives and assessments. They weren't objective or fair. It was a horrible office environment to be in. You were overworked and not given the tools to succeed. There was nepotism and favoritism. Husband and wives working together, boyfriends and girlfriends cousins and lovers. It was an absolute nightmare."
good,"Typical day - super busy, lots of transaction, solutions searching."
good,They focus too much on a sales aspect instead of focusing on assisting customers in a timely manner. This specific branch is in a small town so it was very difficult to open new accounts since most individuals already had one.
good,seen improvement in my time but all they care is sales. I do not have anything against sales but some sales seems at the expense of the customer
good,"Very hard to work at, but the perks are good for not having to work weekends. The people have different attitudes, some are easy to work with , some are hard to work with. The job is challenging, very demanding."
good,"Walk in customers who have banking needs from lost debit cards, to wanting to open checking/savings accounts.and most other banking related needs."
good,Wells Fargo seemed unprepared to take on Wachovia's more advanced technology.  It was difficult to watch somedays.
good,"I enjoyed the push to sell. It was always encouraged to see who could sell the most. I did not get the most sales. However, I did have the highest in sales by dollar amount."
good,"Extremely busy, constant customer complaints and issues due to not enough staffing. Company looking to go towards technology for everything.Company has forgotten that people are the face of the company."
good,"They make a point of distinguishing between FTE and contracted employees, and treat the contract employees as such.  From the beginning you know you are only there to complete a job and that they can let you go at any time."
good,"The training is not solid, you are not prepared for the task at hand with the training that is provided. Company values quantity over quality. A setup for failure."
good,It would have been better if it was a permanent job. The girls are not nice poor management. The girls like to play Jr high school games. Nothing more to add.
good,"Company talks a good game as far as caring for employees and customers, does little to support this. Low level team members treated very coldly by upper management."
good,"I was the oldest worker in my department and they knew I had diabetes. but yet I was doing most of the work that the younger people of the warehouse should have done.but nobody wanted to do. manigmint and some of the employees didn't care about the building or stand people, was quick to blame others and departments for their mistakes. I left because the stress was getting to my diabetes and I was missing a lot of work going in and out of the hospital over it.and I didn't thank it was Fair to the other employees to have to cover my shift win I was gone."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Prepare to do whatever job you are hired for until your current manager is prepared to let you leave. If you are doing something too well, that will magically make it so you are denied advancement in spite of your worthiness. Several employees have encountered this experience"
good,"Wells Fargo is apt to blame the employee for any downfalls of the company and especially of the management, in my six years this has never faltered. The company took all of its recent lawsuits and put the income lowering directly on their employees. There is no accountability on the management which in my time has been aggressive if not altogether misogynistic. If you just need any job this is the place for you, if you're looking to grow in the financial field I would skip the stress and humiliation."
good,"The group I worked with was managed quite poorly.  It was a ""good ole boy"" group with promotions only handed out to those who can BS their way through their job. Most of my co-workers were pleasant, but where there for the same reason and quickly left, so turnover was quite frequent."
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo you would have to answer incoming calls."
good,"There is no culture of care for the employees of this company. The only way to make it up the ladder is by knowing someone higher up, it isn't based on your performance or dedication to the company (at least in the district I work for)."
good,"They had stipulations on employees that were impossible to meet.  They would anger customers by continual pushing of products.  They wanted to treat each customer as though they were a stranger.  I worked in a small town where you knew your customers.  You saw them when shopping, baseball fields, church, etc.  We were usually on a first name basis with each customer, yet WF wanted us to treat them as strangers.  I would say this was the worst part of the job.  The most enjoyable part was talking to and trying to brighten our customers day."
good,I enjoyed my time at this company as a sales person. My other positions are not as cool. A tough environment in which an employee can easily outgrow.
good,Late nights and job description is no good. You do NOT get paid for work that is required. Goals and bonus are impossible.
good,there is no job security at all.Also there is too much employee turnovers. Management was alright. Co workers were friendly. Hardest part of the job was meeting all the expectations
good,Great atmosphere. Pushes employees to strive for the best. Sales oriented. Its team oriented. Gives each employee the chance to be the best they can be
good,"The base salary can't live on. After 28 years in the industry the hardest place to get loans completed and approved, customers very upset with service levels and management refuses to fix issues."
good,They first give you promotion but very soon give you hard time to meet goals. So pressure!
good,great place to work with lot of fun. attended lot of learning and development trainings.
good,"Nepotistic environment in which management does nothing while employees consistently regress in profitability and performance. Management instructs employees to work forced, unclocked and unpaid overtime to boost their team numbers with no regard for how that affects the employee to work a 12 hour day unpaid."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is helping clients obtain their financial goals
good,"Under extreme stress due to management, very unprofessional distasteful attitude towards people of color. Very happy once the assignment ended, this company needs to take great consideration of whom they allow in management."
good,I have worked for WF for over 8 years and it was very stressful working there. You are not given much of job support and hardly any help from your manager or your supervisor. No one in the company likes to take ownership and likes to dump the work on others.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know members of the community you serve.  "
good,"The Fremont Lockbox office might lack diversity but they have plenty of culture."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I absolutely loved working there until the lawsuit then it didnt feel right. I learned a lot of valuable skills however, it was not a permanent fix. I was in charge of rowdy workers."
good,"Its been five years since I worked there, so there nothing I really have to say beside the low pay and the them forcing you to get customers customer to sign up for more accounts and services"
good,"The managers took their job WAY TOO SERIOUSLY. If you looked like you weren't busy they would give you busy work for no reason. They even counted me 10 seconds late coming back from lunch. I was eventually let go after giving them more than a year working for them in that type of work environment. I would not suggest working for this company as they have unrealistic ""goals."" They say they did away with sales goals, they didn't. They just call it something else now."
good,Management from top to bottom was not good. Managers telling staff that they were required to do things that weren't required. Forcing staff to work every weekend.
good,"Wells Fargo was an average company to work for. During my employment there, my mom was going through chemo from stage 4 cancer and Wells Fargo refused to give me family leave. I had to use all of my vacation and sick hours in order to be there for my dying mother. When she passed away, my managers told me that I either return to work within a couple of days or I will lose my job. I was not in a mentally healthy place so soon after her death. I was forced to leave due to these very unfortunate circumstances. My fellow employees is what made the environment more welcoming. I found that management at the time would pick out certain people and give them a harder time."
good,Poor mismanaged branch where they played favorites and making the working environment uncomfortable for others to work around if you didn’t have kids you never got a weekend off
good,The environment is tough and doesn't have room for advancement. The work environment is difficult and the management even more difficult. Possibly better in different departments.
good,Spent more than 60 hours a week working both from the office and home without overtime. Grueling travel requirements and burdensome amount of work were required.
good,A company once known for its impeccable integrity is now trying to rebuild a lost reputation.  Focus and energy are on re-establishing trust with clients and communities.  The entire organization is dedicated to proving changes have been made and will be kept for the future.
good,"If I can help it I will never work for this company again. The culture is biased towards anyone other than Mexicans and white people, at least here in Arizona."
good,I enjoyed working with the customers that came to the bank. Working with all of the banks' tellers and helping management in the operations and running of the bank.
good,"when i didnt hit the metrics i felt guilt shamed.  got passed up 3 times for promotions that i deserved, but because i didnt work at a location where i could get in with right  people cause its all about who your cool with at wells fargo, not on merit"
good,"Wells Fargo could be a great company to work for - but lack of clarity and direction - steady, calm, non-inflammatory direction - from the management is hard to find. Thus you are left with frantic, fire-drill level, work every minute of every day only to throw away hard work the next day because of changed minds, Uncommunicated priority change, etc. I really was sad to leave and would love to come back to a new Wells Fargo that had a clear mission and complimentary priority set - one I could dig into and feel like I had the ability to impact or accomplish something against. Instead, I left because every day felt like throwing myself at an immovable wall as hard and as fast as I could only to get up the next day, throw away any progress I’d made and do it all over again."
good,I worked for the company as they were transitioning from Wachovia to WellsFargo.  The managers were knowledgeable and trained very well.  The pay was good for that time period.
good,I worked at WF for over 10 year got laid off and was called back 9 months later. I got laid off again with no warning. Gave alot of time to this company and was very loyal. My career advanced rapidly there and I gained alot of knowledge.
good,the work/ personal life balance was very stressful. the leadership didn't support their staff and didn't provide proper training for the new position at hand. I spent most days crying
good,Typical day at work started off being monitored from the minute I walked in.  We even got questioned where we were at when we were in the bathroom.  Management is under experienced.  Workplace culture was weird.  Nobody was happy.  The only thing I enjoyed was my fraud reviews.
good,"It was enjoyable to work for Wells Fargo but the Managment team wasn’t fit to manage.  Which was found out after I left, being that the entire management team was let go."
good,"Wells Fargo is a challenging place to work.  There are many obtacles to working  for a company that has undergone as many employment challenges as Wells Fargo.  As this company seeks to regain the trust of the American public its ethos is to trust no employee with any responsibility.  Further, management is derisive and belittling."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I was doing a Great Job at Wells until September of 2016 when Wells committed  fraud with their current customers.  the phones stopped ringing and customers did not want to do business with Wells.
good,"Working for a huge corporation like Wells Fargo I had high expectations when it came to team members and management. The work is exhausting and not efficient. They force you to call dead leads on a constant bases. Team members aren't allowed to have casual conversations during down time. There are about 3 different mangers you have to report to and non of them are on the same page nor professionally communicate with one another. A typical day at work was a nightmare. HR is a joke! I learned that if you're feeling uncomfortable at work or like your not growing or learning, its important to take your skills else where."
good,"Not a work/life balance type of place with no empowerment to really be able to assist clients. Benefits are good, coworkers are nice, management is a bit immature and not too eager to help."
good,Organization great for entry level to mid-level professional. My current role is not professionally rewarding seeking workload that offers challenge and professional growth.
good,My view point on work and a safe work environment varied greatly than what was offered at Wells Fargo. I had a challenge fitting into the company's culture.
good,first to come in banker side. last to leave banker side. not enough bankers nor tellers so had to both to many days relocated me to farther bank from my home and my children school. had to end giving my two weeks and now I'm jobless so not really good with looking out for their employees.
good,They would put you on notice if you did not meet their sales goals.  If my sales went up my negative feedback would increase on the customer service rating.
good,"management at wells fargo bank didn`t care about there enployee.they let us struggle,they don`t send help when we needed help and the manager did what they what too.when you complain to higher management they don`t do nothing."
good,"La cultula bancaria no es solo mas que ventas. Aunque aprendi mucho, tienes que trabajar extremadamente duro para salir adelante."
good,"Not all the area's and Departments of Wells Fargo are bad, but most are.  The Ratio for Upward Mobility and Advancement is scarce to be Completely Honest.  Incredibly difficult to break into a different line of business with the company, and Incentives were not offered in the Bankruptcy Department."
good,No growth movement within my educational background. Currently not interested in any additional schooling or required certifications at an ( meaning my own) pocket expense.
good,"I have made good friends with my fellow colleagues while employed at Wells Fargo, mentored new team members and learned about how retail banking works."
good,They treat customers terrible.  Take advantage of people all the time and ask you to do very unethical things every day.  Poorly staffed and will promise you the world and do non of it
good,"Management lacks communication and personal skills"
good,All they focused on was SALES and QUOTAS.  They did not care who you talk to they just want you to push whatever product we have even though it is not beneficial to the customer.
good,Good place to work. Loved that I was given my customers and it was my responsibility to build the relationship and identify the fraudulent activity .
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Hard to get commission here and it is easily taken away. For the smallest most random things. Like being late 3min coming back from lunch.
good,The mortgage division is too top heavy.  The sales people have a ridiculous goal to meet that their job depends on which makes them edgy and pushy.  I received little training but was expected to work miracles.
good,"Workplace motto should have been, ""Company first, family second."" Many parents were faced with hard decisions while trying to balance work and family.  Schedules would change constantly without warning or regard of family commitment.   Performance metrix were never good enough."
good,"WF was a very stressful environment in which to work.  The sales goals were not attainable.  Employees were not expected/trained to behave/speak in a professional manner with both clients and co-workers.  There was no recognition for employees, unless you were a top seller.  Management encouraged rude behaviour, and did not concern themselves with maintaining loyal customer's business.  There was very little opportunity for growth, and discrimination was evident.  The hours an employee is expected to work if their center is open on Saturdays is not appropriate.  You are working 6 days a week, and the banking center is open until 6 p.m.  There is no break for Saturdays, and you are expected to work from 8:30-2:30."
good,"Wells Fargo is overall a great place to work overall however, a few concerns with the company becoming so large in last 14 years. "
good,Wells Fargo has not been one of my best jobs that i would like to discuss. The company from i have seen does not appreciate its employees and hours are horrible. Its not a typical job for a mother and wife.
good,"Working for Wells Fargo, NA was stressful due to the high sales pressure of financial services on customers, and getting threaten by management if sales (goals) were not met on daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly schedule."
good,"Every day was walking on egg shells if i would make enough sales to keep my job, compensation was terrible, customers hated coming in because they were sick of products being shoved down their throats"
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was the customer interaction.  I love connecting with new people and finding ways to meet their needs.  Wells Fargo management style could use improvement.  Employees are motivated out of fear and left to feel inadequate even when exceeding goals.  Managers call employees for sales numbers when on vacation and require staff to skip breaks as the feel necessary.
good,"long hours of helping customers with their banking needs. management demands of sales every day increasing the goal so you could never reach it to make more of the promised money. every day was a Janet Jackson song of what have you done lately? never mind what you did yesterday or last week. punished if you cant reach that goal. because your the best at your job, management has you train the newest employees to do the same job as you at no compensation to you for your skill or experience."
good,"the coworkers are great, and it's a typical corporate company. Some flexibility; still company could start having flex jobs in the workplace. this would make more people happier."
good,Wells Fargo starts most of their employees as temps and makes it very difficult for a good employee to become permanent. Lots of favoritism.
good,Responsible for collecting on all currently due and past due automobile accounts. Some research called for skip tracing and reviewing asset checks to attempt to locate lienholder.
good,"I enjoyed the job and loved everything about it. There was room for advancement and growth, there was a happy environment the lots of fun. Then there was a change in management and then things were not the same.The typical work day started with me and a group of people having coffee time we hugged and said goodmorning everyday. My co-workers were great and we always worked hard and helped each other out. The most enjoyable part was beating the deadlines that were put in front of us, we always beat the deadlines and would get pizza day or subs.Managment was good and everyone treated each other great, then management changed and everyone left things were different and everyone started leaving."
good,Was too strick and didn't work with employees to keep their job
good,Its most difficult for ladies to work for night shifts. I learned how to work in team. Team work plays an important role in ever co workers in the team.
good,"Wells Fargo's WFCC is the closest that you can get to working in a swaet shop. Long demanding hours, wardens on every row, always questioned about activities. It like being a robot the same thing everyday just come in, sit down, and flip the on switch."
good,"Excellent relationship with co workers, corporate changed products and services on a regular basis making it hard to 'sell' to the customer with an extensive knowledge. Had goals and expectations constantly raised even when they werent met previous quarters. Very expensive insurance. Pay rate horrible."
good,"I got the best sales training from wells fargo. Because of all the time they invested in me I became a great banker. However, I went through many managers. The company lets go of anyone who is not producing at their standards. My days were spent at offsites producing bad quality accounts. I left due to all the stress."
good,A typical day at Wells Fargo is very hectic especially at the retail banking level. The managers like to micro manage and it puts a  lot pressure on you to perform well. The managers at the branch I work at are very unprofessional and do not know how to address individuals in a respectable manner. It was a job that I applied for as a grad student but not an industry or job I would like to start a career with.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,A typical day of working here is always short staffed. I learned to be patient with training and being careful handling customer accounts. Most management would push you to sell products. Co workers were not team players and I honestly believe that would be the hardest part of the job. I loved my customers.
good,"I hate how management treats their employees, setting unreachable goals while taking away the tools that allow their employees to reach those goals"
good,Company didnt provide enough training to preform the job correctly
good,Wells fargo was a fast moving customer based operation. I learned to deal with the ever moving pace and perfecting my job functions. My co-workers were very willing to assist and knowledgable in their field. 
good,Overall it's a great company to work for. No room to grow and advance
good,I'm in search of a longterm and or more stable and secure position that will enable me to utilize the skills that I've acquired throughout my career.
good,• Federal Reserve security clearance attained.
good,"Work was great when you could get it, but most of the time it was only 16 to 20 hours a week."
good,the job provides no work life balance. Management does not value good workers.
good,"The manager was mostly remote and wasn't aware of what was happening in the office. When work tasks were completed, they were wrong because she kept changing her mind. As a consultant, I won't ever be able to work at Wells Fargo again again because of her bad review of me.  I was warned that she was impossible.  Should have listened."
good,"responsibilities change, pay is low in the BK auto dept, people I wok with are awesome , not a lot of room for advancement. Team members rely on each other alot to get work done, due to management being in meetings alot"
good,"-typical day open and close the branch"
good,management sucks in the Memphis market. Get a job. Gain experience and move on. Don't get stuck. MOOVE ON. a lot of favoritism in this market. Heard other markets where better! Good luck!
good,"My security dept was very horrible, you couldn't have freedom of speech even in private. he was not patient with me. And it was very confusing and not a good place to work at."
good,I worked in two different departments. Both were shut down. The first department was a joke. My old boss sexually harrashed me and then fired me when I wouldn't put up with it. My second department was great until we got laid off out the blue. It pays good but not worth dealing with some of the none sense. Racisim is alive here
good,"I've currently been with the company over 5+ years. It was great at first until I had to call HR on my branch manager. I ended up transferring to another branch because of the retaliation. Even though they say ""zero tolerance"" For retaliation. Also,  I have never been able to get promoted. Almost feel as if I've been ""blacklisted"". This market is ran as a dictatorship."
good,"Wells Fargo has everything it needs to be one of the best places you've ever worked at except their work culture is high-pressure sale! And it Sucks!! Most customers hate walking into a Wells Fargo Branch as well as the Wells Fargo employee themselves. The sales training I reserved at Wells Fargo was the best training I have ever gotten. Some companies were quick to hire me just because they saw I worked for Wells Fargo on my resume. I believe working at Wells Fargo is great for the knowledge and experience, however, I've heard they change a few things to help create a healthy culture maybe things are better now."
good,"I started with Wachovia bank and it was bought by Wells Fargo.  I enjoyed working for Wachovia Bank, there was more of a work/life balance.  I start my day with a morning huddle and giving the team recognition. We open the branch and I assist the tellers with daily operation task, I complete observation my bankers and service manager to provide feedback and complete one on one’s which includes developiment plans"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"This is a difficult place to work, relentlessly stressful and demanding. Mgmt is not interested in helping. It is also intensely political. Good opportunity to gain experience if you can take it."
good,Wells Fargo has changed their culture from sales to service which leads to little room for growth and advancement. No opportunity for bonus commission which used to be a big part of compensation plan
good,The company still doesn’t know how to guide people in this position. This is a good position if it was translated into a partner referral role. I had learned a lot in this role.
good,"It's all about who you work with, the Wells culture is great but can be very shady. Some tellers were able to use the walk in clients as leads for goal, while other tellers would be written up."
good,"Over all great depending on management. The branch manager gets paid salary but is never present while the bottom of the barrel strives to achieve excellence for a small quarterly bonus that gets taxed while the managers bonus is in the 1000s other then that the customers and the job are over all great, and depending on the branch you work at you could be extremely busy or dead."
good,I really like my job duties and my co-workers but management seems to be out of touch and does not understand the daily struggles of their front-line employees.
good,Poor upper management employees who stayed after the bad press received poor treatment from upper management. It seemed as though employees were not allowed to make a mistake without fear of job loss
good,the management at the time was terrible.. they made me work drive thru more than other tellers and we had quotas to make for referrals but since I was the fastest worker I had to do drive thru where its all just current customers no referrals opportunities
good,"The current culture at Wells Fargo is one of fear, and emphasis is placed toward focusing on not making mistakes rather than on sound, profitable deal making and growth."
good,Wells Fargo does not care for their team members at all. All they care about is to try and implement back cross selling in a different way to get customer to buy their product.
good,"manger plays favortism. You have manager promoting and giving higher salary to friends over hard workers. There was office relationship, employee unethical things like opening credit cards, loans, etc to consumers who doesn't speak english. The managers turn a blind eye to this and instead promote these employee and recognise their unethincal behavior during meeting."
good,Very stressful to produce business in the environment that had been forced on the sales staff. Leadership did not provide clear direction and presented unrealistic goals.
good,unfortunately I did not have a great experience with this company. i worked during a time when the sale goals were more to management than properly taking care of staff and clients
good,"managers plot on employees, don't let them advance..                                 very young minded.. petty.. lots of investigations..  they play favorites"
good,Decent place. If you can be a yes man/woman. The ability to think for yourself and no there. Good/strong quality training provided growth is hard to come by.
good,You will come into your desk and get phone call all day long.  You have to balance yourself so you don't get stressed out. I learned from management that you have to communicate properly with your team.
good,"Phone banking, dealing with customers over the phone regarding various accounts and soliciting new business (and we all know how that came down on them)"
good,"Wells Fargo used to be a great place to work until they got greedy with wanting to open up more and more accounts.  They didn't manage the aspect of sales very well, and they didn't give back to the employees as much as they should.  Not in the sense of money or paid time off but in the sense of treating one as a human being.  Micromanaging got way out of hand and made people feel like children. Then there was the aspect of meeting goals and if you didn't meet the out of range goals you were coached reprimanded making you feel worst."
good,"Enjoyed the teammates I worked with and became a little family while working there but from entry level to management the stress of achieving sales goals was insane, They made it hard and harder each quarter to achieve goals and basically forces people into products the did not need due to those goals. Very unprofessional."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I believe they need more training technique. The classes was too large and for some people who never worked in loan Dept as myself going from medical office to this? Was a bit difficult it was a nice environment and professional.
good,"metrics that had to be met, if not making metrics for one day it was very hard to make your month goals.  If one day was missed it would take at least 2 weeks to catch back up."
good,I was laid off 4 times from Wells Fargo and fired for no reason so my opinion is not good right now.  I enjoyed the people i worked with. I had some good managers.  I guess working 10 years for a company doesn't mean much anymore.
good,They hire and dump them . They were too bust to even guide me so i did nothing that entire month.Good stepping stone. Step and keep walking. Even if they hire you full-time they will find a way to fire you if you become too expensive.
good,"Decent pay, but otherwise unappreciative employer.  Disconnect between immediate management and senior management.  Focus is on managing budgets rather than embracing employee talent and loyalty."
good,"They cared more about the bottom line than the comfort of their employees.  The computers were really old, chairs were uncomfortable, and no incentives were offered."
good,"If you are a drone or worker bee then WF is okay. Otherwise, forget it. management is rigid and allows no entrepreneurial spirit. many people feel trapped in their jobs and there is no team feeling."
good,i disagree with the business practices and how they treat their customers. no way to move up in the company if you start in the position i started in. If your willing to not care about the customer or assist them to your full potential this is a great place for you
good,The do not treat employees with respect.  Look elsewhere for employment. Managers talk down to workers. Too may long meetings with little content and difficult to interpret.
good,Rude management and uncaring facility. Only department ive been in so I should probably look around more. hardest par of job is not being accepted for your hard work and being pushed aside
good,Very difficult company to work for. They do have great pay but you half to ask yourself is the pay worth your sanity. Are you ready for constant barking.
good,Employees don't receive the praises deserved and managers have their favorites. If you're not a favorite then you'll get anywhere. I have met great people working there.
good,The sales goals were out of the roof. They did not care about sales ethics nor the work life balance. They were not efficient and did not follow proper Standard Operating Procedures.
good,"management was all about themselves.  the team did not matter... only making goal.  In sales goals are very important, but the people that you go to battle with everyday and spend the majority of your time with also matter."
good,"Mandatory overtimes at random intervals, strict standards which are constantly in fluctuation, co-workers are the only saving grace."
good,Company overall is good to work for and provides an environment to be successful.  Work hard and you can be successful overall depending on how you define success and what you're looking for out of work and life.
good,had an overall negative experience with this company. managers unprofessional and show favoritism in daily work practice. not a good place for advancement. although team members where GREAT to work with.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,there is room for advancement with in the company like they say there is i been in the same department for 3 years and there is alot of favoritism in this company
good,Horrible supervisors. Little chance of advancement unless you are friends with supervisors. NO sick time and do not accept doctor notes
good,"in my years with the bank I had 1 manager that was outstanding and this does not reflect on him in the slightest.  The 2 other managers I worked under however did not know the first thing about managing, were overtly racist and sexist and would let people get by sleeping 7 out of the 8 hours they were on the clock."
good,It was cool. not too stressful. great project managers. co-workers very competitive. they feed us most days so i didn't have to buy lunch.
good,Worked there twice contracting. Each time Wells Fargo lied about the project length funding and scope. Each time work was gotten to a point then handed off to over seas groups over seen by others within the IT infrastructure. Seemed like a conflict and an outright lying to contractors was acceptable.
good,"- They rely too heavily upon part-time workers, many rotate through several different agencies doing the same job. Suspect this is a way for Wells to skirt the 18 or 24 month labor issue, that limits a company from using part-time workers rather than full-time."
good,overall ok place to work. Good health benefits. low pay and low compensation. Life balance is low with the work load. management is ok. customer loyalty low. company is all about money not necessarily the consumers
good,My supervising manager was not one to fallow the rules and regulations set by the corporate office. I even told my store manager and she did not seem to care either.
good,"Underwriting was not my forte'!! Quick Training, Loved Credit Bureau Reporting. Management was OK, especially with the HARP Underwriting team"
good,"Very sales oriented, very sketchy with how things were run.  Due to such a strong pressure to sell, ethics aren't always a priority"
good,"No Holiday Pay, No vacation or PTO offered, Pay is very low for what the job entails and don't even ask to get more money.  "
good,"Everyday I get to use some investigative skills at work. I constantly am able to resolve my customer's financial issues. Whether it is a fee on their account or fraud, I can spot issues quickly and handle them along with giving them awesome service."
good,I like this position because it is a fast paced environment and i was able to establish relationships with my customers and help them maintain their homes.
good,"Wells fargo loosing its US culture in India. As Indian mentality managers spoiling the work culture in wells fargo bangalore. "
good,A great place to learn the culture of a corporate at it's peak of micromanaging
good,"The company was ne to California and ended up being bought out by wells fargo. Not the best place to work, they were still testing the grounds of the company."
good,"very overworked, low pay. Seniority beats hard work. They benefits are good, prepare to work for years to move up in corporate."
good,"Assist customer with account questions and offer products and/or services. I learn to have thick skin working for this company. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Overly agreesive sales with unaccomlishable goal. Complete imbalance of personal and business life
good,"I enjoyed my time with Wachovia, especially my fellow co-workers."
good,Management very unprofessional. Long periods of time (7hrs) before getting a break period. etc.
good,"Store Management in the majority of cases have no college education, they are good sales people that started as a banker, who also does not require college education, and then get promoted to store management. It is practically a jungle, you need to survice. If your are not constantly opening checking accounts you will no enjoy this job, even though Wells Fargo has a great portfolio of bank products"
good,"I held huddles every morning to discuss where we stood with goals and to gain committments for the day from each employee plus I held multiple coaching sessions throughout the day with bankers and service managers to discuss their plans for the day and how they were progressing with their plans.  I was on multiple conference calls each day with my district manager to discuss my branches numbers and where I projected us to finish at the end of the day and where we did finish at the end of the day.  I had a fabulous team that really worked together.  I was successful with operations and scored the banks first 100% on an external audit.  I really learned alot about coaching while employed with Wachovia, which I feel is probably my biggest attribute."
good,"Wachovia Values and Direct feedback was a great tool that everybody could access and transmit to their inmediate and upper management team."
good,"Highly Toxic corporate culture.  Shareholder driven.  Micromanagement gone wild.  Unrealistic goals and expectations...and things are getting WORSE!  Stay away or get out while you can!  High stress, low pay!!!"
good,"A standard day at work has gone from a fast paced, secure environment with the promise to advance, to a slow paced setting with no ability to forward my career path. "
good,The hardest part of the job is the schedule... Easy job to do. Enjoyed working with co-workers.. The benefits were they costly. Over $440. per month for my family. Which cause my bi weekly pay checks to not be over 700. The starting pay was low. My experience and back ground should have showed that I was a hard working with talent.
good,Too much sales pressure. Micro management. No advancement if not producing sales.
good,"The main focus of the Wells Fargo corporation is profit, and the employees get left behind.Once Wells Fargo took over Wachovia, the paid time off decreased, family care days were done away with, and health benefits were altered."
good,if you are in a store that the manager likes you then your growth possibilities are endless but if you get a manager that does not like you for whatever reason you best resign because you will never grow
good,Easy going customers but overly micro managed. Need more personable managers and stronger more consistent leadership.
good,"Good compensation, but 18 month limited duration for contractors creates lack of continuity and high turn over."
good,A typical day is busy but productive
good,Recieve banking inquiries discussing long and short term financial goals. Actively suggest and sell bank products and process loans.
good,"Interact with customers to provide information in response to inquires about products and services. Complete transactions between loan establishments, borrowers, and sellers. Asking Probing Questions to see what best matches the clients’ needs. Follow Federal regulations. Do Demand letters for clients and third parties go over contracts and educate clients on how their home loan or home equity lines of credit work. Resolve conflicts for upset clients. Document accounts thoroughly."
good,"Enjoyed working with the people, the work was very easy. I enjoyed going to work and having little supervision. I like to work independently."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Insurance is poor, commissions are somewhat unattainable for most."
good,"they are a horrible company it only works well by leadership at individual sites no good as a company as a whole, it is not wells fargo they went back to just banking it is now the horrid company securitas"
good,"Great company with wonderful benefits. The leadership is lacking big time from the frontline managers. If you're college educated, you will hate it. Managers will be intimidated by you."
good,"Corporate Politics this is the first employee I’ve ever felt filled yet discouraged . Corporate Politics was introduced to me for the first time ever in my career. I was extremely passionate about my position learning and growing. But if management feels a challenge you will NOT grow. I loved my job, my employer. The management team gave me huge health issues to this day."
good,"This place was stressful to work for. They demanded sales, but half the time you couldn't transfer anyone because they didn't meet the qualifitcations. "
good,Horrible management. Did not care about family. Horrible pay. Would not recommend this company. They make empty promises. They go through too many managers.
good,"Wells Fargo treats contracted resources extremely differently than a Full Time Employees. Your status is that of a second class employee. Often you will be treated badly, out right lied to or insulted by full time employees. Contractors cannot really report problems or issues because they fear retribution and there is no corporate policy for a contractor to report bad behavior. You need very thick skin to contract at Wells Fargo."
good,The company does not uphold their own vaules. Their management team are not ones that should represent the company. Their is very little respect for their employees. I have experence some level of discrimination due to my use of FMLA.
good,Its a place to start off at but wouldnt recommended staying. They offer alot of great benefits but when it came down to the overall status of working for them it was not so good.
good,"Wells Fargo is a multi-national company and is undergoing transformation mandated by strict Federal oversight laws.   New management is at the helm planning to steer the company in a new direction to meet or exceed expections of the Board of Directors, shareholders and regulators."
good,They decide what the rates are which they have the power to stop you from origination of loans if they are too busy by raising the rates so that they are not competitive
good,"Management isn't flexible. A lot of micromanaging. Biased and favoritism when it comes to promotions. Culture is very gossipy and uncomfortable. Expectations are unrealistic provided the limited resources and constant changes due to multiple lawsuits. They talk about educating, changing lives, and diversity and inclusion,  but are more concerned with getting them in an out, unless they have money. Upper management doesn't tend to their team and has no clue what happens in branches. Overall, the best thing about Wells Fargo are the benefits. Otherwise, if you want to have a life outside of work or have a day off, you will find yourself practically begging. If you want to advance, you will find that your hard work will be overseen and be given to someone who knows half the work you know or none-or given to external hires. They will overwork you and yet still be unappreciative of your dedication. Spent 5 years with this company and worked at multiple branches, each one had one or more of these situations occurring, if not all."
good,"Not worth the headache, they don't work with your schedule, don't understand that life is as important as your job, not having support when you need it"
good,"Branch level work sucks.  Most of the management does not care or is incompetent.  The company does a great job of hiring from with in, but it turns out to be a negative.  This promotes people who are favored over a qualified candidate.  I am a likable guy so that system favors me, but still it is not a good system.  The compensation for the job is not good until you get higher up outside of the retail branches."
good,Higher management makes there own rules when it comes to wanting to be the best in the district. Company doesn't know where they are going. There are beyond many changes. Workers are not being paid enough and being told to do more. They also force team members to join a training for a title they do not want to do. It is beyond a stressful job and so many ways to get fired.
good,"the company requires you to have production, if you don't have production, they let you go right away. "
good,"Management isn’t the best, most of the time they are short staffed so you are busy all the time. Annual reviews ate based on your performance but management doesn’t have time to coach. Lots of favoritism, which makes you feel stuck."
good,Poor management and HR backs up their bad behavior. You feel like you have no where to turn for help when the higher ups seem to be against you. They need to do management training.
good,"Simply put, it's like high school all over again. Popular kids get the advantages. Do you're work, but keep your mouth shut if you want to keep your job."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"To many negatives to name. Could be an awesome employer is Management was better. Extremely stressful, management uncaring. Not enough care for risk and customer focus is very weak."
good,In auto it seems as if the right hand doesn’t know why the left hand is doing. It is a good company to work for they just need to be more competitive in salary.
good,"WF Mtg was a great place to work,WF  Shareowner Services not great at all was there for 6 years with company overall 19 years. SUPERVISORS ARE AWEFUL!"
good,Manager could be better they could be more concerned with employees not just themselves they should treat them with more respect and understanding and care
good,"Wells Fargo at the onset was an exciting place to work, but the negative news as it relates to the fraudulent accounts has really tarnished its brand."
good,"I worked her for about 3 years. I quickly fell into my career and was promoted 3 times within the first year. Although my performance didn't change the well rain dry. It was rough when all the lawsuits came up. I didn't feel supported by the company until it was too late. I also tried to transfer to a different career path for months until I gave up. Although Wells Fargo is 1 brand the transfer process doesn't exist. You have to essentially get rehired for a new position, any move you make."
good,Management was horrible. Very strict. overworked and underpaid. I worked very hard for a promotion. they would keep telling me I'm getting a promotion and never got it. We would always get good reviews saying  how they would like their experience working with me.
good,Management was horrible very hostile work enviroment.  vacation time and benefits were good.  Had to work every Saturday or Sunday and all holidays. Sales goals were unrealistic.
good,At one time it was a great place to work. Once GE was purchased and all leadership was taken over by Only GE employees the culture changed drastically
good,When I left the culture was poor and leadership was disconnected to reality. Their tunnel vision of only wanting to get numbers was a stressful culture.
good,"This position is great for students. The research portion of the role worked hand in hand with my legal and fiscal researching abilities. As a single mother, full-time student (MBA), and an entrepreneur, this position did not offer any growth advancement or investment opportunities. Great for college kids"
good,"Approving Revenue Share request, Sending out Visa transaction wires.  I enjoyed working with my co workers in San Francisco we were a family.  Hardest part about my job dealing was dealing with the favoritism between work sites SF and Salt Lake City.  I enjoyed when customers truly thank the staff for providing great customer services helping out with billing issues and payment inquiries"
good,"The benefits are good and you do have opportunity to earn higher pay depending on your position and you may be given the chance to move up. However, the people that have worked there are condescending and do not treat everyone fairly. They act like a bunch of high school students and if they do not know you they give you the cold shoulder and are rude, especially the women supervisors. They do not pay fairly to all and when trying to get a raise they ask you to prove things that you already do but really they are just trying to procrastinate because they do not want to find the money to give to you that you deserve."
good,"It broke me. "
good,I worked 2 shift separating and coding mortgage applications. I enjoyed the work. I was a top performer and received awards. I was also asked to help other areas.
good,"Great company concept, but majority of employees are contracted and not merited based on work but personality.  No Job Security.  Very high volume weekly turnover of employees.  Contract company not very honest or forthright."
good,"They were understaffed and under compensated, they had forced overtime with no additional pay, barely paid above the poverty level, and were looking to outsource everything when I left.  Essentially it was 60-70 hours a week with barely 55 a year in comp , you may not want to pay wall st. money but you have to pay more than this..."
good,Wells Fargo could direct more focus to ensuring loyal Team Members are properly compensated.  This has been a major shortfall for many years. The best part of working with the company is meeting new people and building friendships.
good,"This job is for someone who is ready to advance and fight for a spot to have a career. It is extremely competitive and about who you know, not what you know. If you are cool with a manager, you will advance quite fast in this environment. The work itself is very tedious and boring."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I decline to comment. I have no desire to participate in this survey. I understand why it's offered but forcing people to take surveys doesn't seem particularly wise.
good,"The typical day at Wells Fargo:"
good,Not very good about advancing especially if you are good at your job.  They would rather keep the high performer exactly where they are rather than allow them to advance professionally.
good,Not the best place to work for compensation and life balance and late nights with folks in india. No real learning curve and polital are awful to work there
good,"The culture at Wells Fargo is very relaxed. However, in order to get ahead in certain departments you have to be a suck up. Depending on if your manager likes you or not you may or may not get a raise."
good,"We were told we were going to be laid off due to the transfer of the office to Florida.  However, that office was not fully up and running.  So my end date was put off and when I needed to leave for another job opportunity, Wells would not give me my termination date so I could get my severance package as all the other employees were able to get."
good,Its a better place to work now. They have a bad reputation but if you work good and smart you would have no problem being successful and feeling good about yourself.
good,"The work environment was extremely stressful, and co workers were very cut throat and non supportive. Sales goals were very high and unreachable. There was fraud everywhere with regard to client accounts and cross selling of unnecessary products."
good,"Management was misleading. I was placed with a temporary agency, and was under the impression from reviews from my reporting manager that I was doing a great job. I came in the next morning for my shift to find out I was not supposed to be there and that my assignment had ended with no notice."
good,"It’s a job with a paycheck. If you can tolerate sitting in a chair for 8 hours being belittled than you can make it here. Answering phones, being coached once a week, short breaks to preserve sanity."
good,I enjoyed doing data entry and opening mail. I learned a little about  home mortgages. Hardest part of the job was the hours 3-11. I would have preferred day shift. Easiest part of the job was everyone was fun to work with.
good,I worked for Wells Fargo Dealer Services in the Notice of Intent department. It was a fast paced environment with plenty to do in order to stay busy. Unfortunately the department didn't offer much in regards to growth because the department relocated to a different state. Regardless I appreciated the opportunity for what it was worth.
good,People were not treated as adults. Very poor leadership. Negative place to work. Daily firings/moving people around. You never knew what was next. Team members were great. Leadership was not.
good,I enjoyed doing what I loved but management was awful. There was no job security due to the fact the department was being eliminated. The compensation was okay and had benefits.
good,"Great job if you're trying to pursue a career with banking & mortgage.  Training could be a little more hands on, Management & the CEO`s that actually manage the certain building could listen to the suggestions of the employees a little more since they are the main people dealing with customers and their issues."
good,"Wells Fargo is great if you are a go getter and love talking to people, work well under pressure. Opportunity to make money and have professional growth."
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work if you are a sales consultant. They will break policy and do things for you that would never do for anyone else if you are a bog producer.  Company is so large that making a simple change can take 12-18 months if not longer.
good,"The people are great for the most part, but it doesn't seem like management does sufficient planning before changing things about how the company works. Instead, they implement changes, and then lower level people are tasked with trying to put out all the fires caused by the change, even when they could have been easily prevented with a little planning."
good,There was a lot of stress put on tellers to sell products and services or lose your job hence the bank teller scandal. I like the job just not the stress of having to sell.
good,"If you do not want a work life balance, then work here. Many phone calls and babysitting files along with customer was required.If you do not mine this, then this is the place for you"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Maybe better. Under new management. No more sales goals. They are focusing more on customer service. To bring in a new culture they need more diversity. The hardest part is dealing with staff members who do not appreciate diversity. Wells Fargo educates their members on diversity but it is not taken seriously in the Area I worked in. The pay is great  & there is room for advancement.
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to learn and grow in the financial industry.  With a sundry of opportunities, you can find the right place for you.  As the company tries to transition in to a more transparent and customer focused company, there are some growing pains and job security/ outlook seem to be at a low.  This will likely pass as the company continues to make great strides in raising the customers expectations.  Some archaic jobs will still be on the proverbial chopping block as Wells Fargo ( along with all other financial institutions) continue to move towards technology and innovation."
good,i would never work with this company again the co workers are not up to par. and the manager is no better. the company does not care about there employees.
good,Hardest part of the job was leaving after 13 years.  I will miss those I worked with for so many years and wish everyone well.  It was a good home for so many years
good,I work back office working direct with states to service our customers from letters to assistance through the Hardest Hit Funds and other state government programs. It is a fast paced environment however no room for growth in the department I work in.
good,I enjoyed helping people and making home ownership possible. I did not agree with the difficulty that it took to close a loan with underwriting. I enjoyed my immediate supervisor.
good,"Wells Fargo is a decent place to work, but the company needs a SEVERE reality check.  The top executives need to stop with the scandals and the blaming of the little guys.  HR needs to actually protect employee rights (that's still a thing right?!) instead of always siding with management.  For the 3+ years I've seen very few people get promoted/advancement in their careers due to actual merit and WAY too many people getting promoted due to being personal friends or playing clash of clans together.  It could've been just the department I got hired into, but get used to all the extra $$ going to the folks higher than you...annual raises have dropped very low regardless of individual performance."
good,Managers get there jobs more based on being bilingual and not based on intelligence. I have never met an employer that would sacrifice quality production because they would.just prefer that person speaks spanish. It is in no way requited for some of the positions. Also too much work for the pay.
good,"Great Team environment. Mgt is the issue. Processes are a hot mess. Mgt needs to redefine operational framework, and improve processes overall. I would probably work here again, but as a last resort."
good,"this was just a job after losing a job that i had really wanted. I worked here for over a year, and had i not been let go, i would probably still be working for them."
good,"This branch should have specified they wanted bilingual employees when hiring. Many times I had to have another coworker come stand at my teller window and translate what the member was saying, and visa versa. It would have gone quicker had that member just taken the customer to their window, instead of making them go through the back and forth between 2 employees."
good,Providing great customer service.
good,"I have worked twice for Wells Fargo as a contractor. The first time I was hired with two other contractors, they cancelled the contract after only 3 weeks for two of us and kept the third. One of those had their contract cancelled even before they had received all their computer equipment."
good,Extremely pushy sales-goals.  Round-the-clock upselling and pushing products that customers didn't always need.  Plenty of opportunities to be shuffled about
good,"rather not too long to write. not  a bad company just inappropriately managed.at times very stressful environment, don't know it has changed under new leadership ."
good,Site leader was more concerned with building cliches than a true business line with employees.  Liked some of the folks that I worked with each day...you cannot be a free thinker with ideas to be at Wells Fargo.
good,"Not a lot to say, antiquated systems and practices. "
good,"I worked for this company because we were acquired through a merger. The company came in and pushed out those employees that had too much experience and also great benefits. Sales had always been encouraged, but with WF it was pushed to the extreme. If you didn't make your quota, you would not be considered for promotion."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,A soul sucking company then doesn't help people financial needs. This company deals with sales to customers and most of the time customers don't need these products or services.
good,Long hours. Low pay. Horrible management.They dont value employees as they pretend like they do. Management need training themselves. stressful working environment.
good,"I loved my most recent position as a Human Resources Business Partner.  But then there was a large scale downsizing of the Human Resources function and because of my tenure I was displaced."
good,It was never included on any job applications because I just started applying for jobs. I had the care giver job that didn't give me time to apply for jobs. I felt as if there were favorites on the job since day one. I had to keep asking questions so they were probably frustrated with that but if they explained it slower to me instead of in a hurry I might of understood it.
good,The front line people are wonderful but the Management are vindictive and have no investment in their people and treat human resources like a commodity.  They will lie and change policy mid term to accommodate needs.
good,A Security firm which provided opportunity to be employed in a basic job with on the job training for security skills needed to provide the services contracted by the company.  No requirement for certifications or special skills.
good,"I am always looking for my employees to tell me things they would like to pursue within the company. By suggesting a project they would like to manage, it shows me their continued interest in the company. I feel confident that if it’s a project they are suggesting, then they will excel at it."
good,Tellers work hard and do not receive adequate pay. I would not recommend this company for a teller position. This company also has been known to pressure there employees to open false accounts.
good,When I was there it basically grinded out until nothing then replaced you with a young naïve person when you burnt out.  You could advance quickly but you had to play their game and potentially compromise yourself ethically.
good,"Working for Wells Fargo for three years has had its ups and downs. With the recent changes to get rid of sales goals it is now a lot less stressful working here. But the push to receive perfect customer service surveys has us gaming the system in a new way; not following policies and procedures in fear of getting a bad score. Also, the pay/raises do not always reflect your performance and what you know. Working here three years and I still make the same as someone who just gets hired today. Advancement is very difficult now that we no longer have sales, which is how they would decide before. They are willing to use you to their benefit but when you are looking to move forward there is not much help."
good,The management group could use training as they are generally unwilling to support there subordinates.The day to fay job is not bad and a lot of good people work for the company.
good,"While I have appreciated the employment over the years, I feel that Wells Fargo Home Mortgage has a selfish culture where management only cares about their own personal numbers instead of developing their employees and retaining talent.  It's become obvious to me that the good old boys club will never change and will always hold certain employees back based on the lack of good employees or proper management in other departments.  Based on this I would like to take my talents elsewhere where we can run a highly efficient and consistent lending institution."
good,"Worked there a long time ago so I really do not have a lot to say,  It was not a good fit for me, processes were completely inefficient to say the least."
good,"No upward mobility in the Operations space, poor management top to bottom. Work is not rewarded effectively in several groups however easy jobs are available and rewarded at the same measure as difficult jobs promoting a culture where hard work is not rewarded."
good,I found out while I worked here that my son would need heart surgery. At first they were supportive but then my supervisor found every little thing to pick apart and I was let go while out  on a leave of absence.
good,"Wells Fargo is a global entity and is driven by metrics alone.  The workers are just that - workers.  If you are looking for a more holistic environment that values the employees equal to the customers, this is not the place to invest your career."
good,"If you enjoy taking peoples money and selling them products they don't need, pretty much if you have no soul this job is for you. You are pretty much stealing with a suit on."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Take inbound calls concerning customers’ transactions, entered important information into the system regarding customers’ accounts and proper information needed to process the account."
good,A typical day consisted of going to my work site and filling in required fields on different computer programs for homeowners trying to avoid foreclosure. I learned a lot of different computer programs and how to navigate through them very well. The management was very lax. co-workers were good hard working people. We never got a lot of opportunities to get to know or fellow co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was my lack of focus and motivation due to boredom and same thing day in and day out.  The most enjoyable part was the people.
good,"Mundane work environment, high expectations for low pay. Constant review of numbers and endless reports. I am a people person and I became very bored of the repetitive Wells Fargo culture. The advancement system didn't make much sense either. Your either bottom of the line teller, then you go to Lead Teller which is pretty much the same thing (but with a higher approval limit) then your option after that is to top of the chain manager. NO CAREER PATHING curriculum."
good,"not much, alot of layoffs, training was not so great, had to learn by trial and error, jobs never last, alot of hiring just to get caught up on work then lay everyone off.....several name changes"
good,"clock in 15 minutes prior to schedule for me would be 3:15. i learned how to multitask throughout the computer, telephone, employees throughout the site, jot down note from customers, also most of all different ways to maintain WONDERFUL customer service."
good,"•	Serviced and updated consumer mortgage accounts"
good,"Lots of learning, tutorials, sales calls and weekend hours but enjoyed the vacation time and providing customer service to friendly clients"
good,We spent the day calling on people who had no idea who we were to tell them we thought they need some debt consolidation and their credit was poor. I learned that people do not know how to manage money and the management did a very good job of telling people that they would never find a better place to work. Hardest part of this job was the market conditions of 2008.
good,It was a nice place to work but was always having my job threatened on a daily basis because of selling products. Put more of a priority on selling than in making sure that customers were taken care of and job was always a have to kinda situation.
good,Loved working and caring for a wide range of animals. Loved to help people to set up a great environment for their pets and critters. Loved to take care and set up the fish tanks that were for display and tanks that were for sale.
good,"Managers try to intimidate instead of lead.  They talk a lot about working with their managers and ""having your back"" but they only talk.  No one in upper level management knows how bad the mid level managers are because there are no exit interviews and any issues are swept under the rug by HR.  This could be a wonderful company to work for but they are consumed with status.  They spend so much time worrying about bowing to VP's that they are not effective.  I do not recommend them for employment unless you are a follower and willing to suck up."
good,I most in retail security and learned to spot a shop lifter and learn how append them legally without hunting them. The management team was very poor and needed to be replace.
good,"I was recruited on how wonderful operation on the mortgage side compared to other big bank, but after joining the promises turns out to be not true."
good,no a lot of development opportunities in Oregon for candidate with divers background. It's very unprofessional and unpleasant  work environment. Unfortunately company doesn't invest their  time to educate their employees because it won't be easy to manipulate employees and customers.
good,"Not a company to work for to receive support and strong well run and well trained management. Focus is on production at the expense of training, support and leadership. Management by fire drill and under extreme pressure. Not a healthy place to grow and thrive."
good,I have no comments at this time to add to this section for working at Wells Fargo.
good,Wells Fargo is Sells driven. The manager I had was all about sales and not providing a positive work environment for his company.I loved working in a bank having a personal professional relationship with my customers but the poor management skills and poor communication skills  made for a tense work environment. My co workers were all very helpful and skillful and some have been there many years. I had learned sales and every aspect of banking but I was maxed out on their pay scale and their was no more room for me to grow.
good,"I answer a multi line switchboard, greet clients and contact their appointed parties. I schedule conference rooms for Financial Advisors in advance of client meetings."
good,"I would review loans for modification and talk to realtors trying to short sale homes. You were given a list of loans to go through by the end of the day and expected to have 99% accuracy. "
good,"Can be a fun place to work with a good life/work balance. Stimulating work, good employee empowerment within current position. Culture is thick with bureaucracy and incompetence. Organizational compliance policies are fear-based, thus creating overreaction and redundancies. Approaches to hiring and advancement need an overhaul, as practices are entrenched in the ways of the old guard."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Provide service to bank customers by conducting appropriate transactions and meeting the needs of customers by referring them to appropriate departments in the bank.  Strongly efficient with SVT and OIB processing applications for daily teller needs to serve our customers.  I am sometimes asked to assist Spanish speaking customers in order to provide services they are seeking.
good,"Responsibilities: Provide customer service via telephone to mortgage holders; research and collect payments and fees; educate customers on loan payments, taxes, and insurance; solve customer problems; complete tax research; work with many tax collecting agencies; assist customers in succeeding financially by cross selling equity products, cash out refinances and other bank products. In addition step into a supervisor role and perform extensive research for escalated issues, in which I would contact the customer and provide resolutions."
good,Culture not what I expect. Battle is between personalities between management and employees. Culture is different between older employees and the younger employees. Overall there is a lack of team work.
good,"at teller position you must sale sale sale, the sale part is not bad but the shaddy things that take place under the table between employees is ugly."
good,"Wells Fargo is one big joke! The company as a whole is shady and DOES NOT HAVE CONSUMERS IN MIND!!! Well, unless of course they consider you a ""high value customer"" or ""private banking"" customer. They are sales oriented to the point of employees blatantly lying to customers! They put pressure on you to reach your sales goals by any means necessary,  while they turn the blind eye. Management is unprofessional and don't care about their employees. Their turnover rate is high for a reason: Beware!!"
good,Appears that company hires massive individuals and then works them to death and then lets them go.
good,WFHM was not in a positive place when I did contract work.  They have changed over time.
good,This is a sales job that requires you to meet gold level metrics.
good,"As Trans Canada Credit, it was a great company to work for. As Wells Fargo not so much, as everything change for the worse, pretty much went out of business due to their philosophy."
good,"I started in NJ, I LOVED it there. I relocated to VA and met some of the most UNETHICAL managers ever! Wish I never left NJ. Company has great benefits, and if you work for great managers it is worth it. I reported unethical activity and was retaliated against so badly that I was having anxiety attacks at work. I was a hard worker, was promoted 3 times within 2 years."
good,Was laid off 4 months after start date. Not enough good training.
good,hire the masses and no talent. the people you work with you will be stuck with and aren't the most willing to help or knowledgeable about their job functions
good,A typical work day started by receiving a list of potential borrowers.  We were required to call every person on the list before the end of the day plus update our current customers.  By the end of the month a person could be contacting up to 150 borrowers a day.  Each borrower I was responsible for obtaining required documents to prove income and residence within a certain time frame.  If the borrower did not send in proper documentation then they were denied.  Each person had a percentage of there borrowers they had to get approved each month in order to meet the goal.  If the goal was met then bonuses were paid out.  I never missed a goal.
good,"I would go in the office review my pipeline. Make all the necessary phone calls to Underwriters, processors as well as emails. Meet any conditions necessary in order to move the file closer to closing."
good,this company is all about sales. if you are looking for customer service this is not the job to apply to. if you can sell ice to an eskimo you are set. the sales goal are extremely high and everything is micro managed to the point where you have to schedule your bathroom breaks.
good,"Each day you are required to make a certain number of sales per day. If you reach this goal you get a pat on the back and asked to do more. If you exceed these goals it still does not matter you get two pats on the back and very rare recognition by district leadership."
good,When I started out at Wells Fargo I was an Administrative Assistant II.  I interviewed for the Administrative Assistant III position and got the job with a substantial pay raise.
good,"Typical day at work comprises of net working with other resources while offering solutions and bridging the gaps feasible among business units. Agility is the trending approach to managing projects although the traditional Waterfall methodologies still remain."
good,"Early in the morning the people who open the bank check both outside and inside the bank to ensure no one is hiding anywhere, no suspicious people are around, and the like. We have certain security procedures to follow when opening a branch to minimize risks to employees."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"This is not a good place to work if you are the typical female person, i.e., White, somewhat older, and college educated."
good,I enjoyed speaking with people and making then rethink of being sent off to collection. I had a 90% turnaround with customers paying what they owed.
good,Busy from 8-5 and possible beyond.
good,"they only hire friends,family and suck ups. And if you are hired they hired you for way less then what your agency was paying you. Yes you have to go through a temp agency. They let people go on their birthdays,and holidays.Tell people the are slow let people go and the very next week hire. new people."
good,• Open and close bank.
good,Wells Fargo closed their processing center of 60+ employees and we all were laid off.
good,great people but upper management needs to be changed. huge company and always hiring new staff.
good,Got employment with Wells through an acquistion from GE Capital. after the acquisition was completed. They started laying off entire departments within the company.
good,"I was under the impression that was the values and customer service was the most important thing for the company but i found out the hard way that all they care is about the numbers ( sales ) and that you can do the best work possible, be a team hard worker person, help in every way possible but if you don't make the ""numbers"" expected you are nobody and nobody cares about you and they threading you every day with losing your job."
good,A day at work for me consisted of greeting customers from a far and trying to make a sale. I learned to be very outgoing and no longer was shy to start a conversation with a complete stranger.
good,• Consistently achieved sales goals by effectively promoting products and services.
good,"Thorough plan for this center was lacking. My supervisor was wonderful and Minnesota is beautiful. However, I was charged for my relocation and this never should have happened."
good,"Typical day at work is working the dialer, calling customers to set up payment arrangements on their vehicle, or prepping their vehicle for repossession."
good,Good place to work. Certain departments work for certain people. The ball dropped on benefits as of 2012 and the company is just changing as a whole.
good,"typical day at work is 12-14 hours, CYA mentality, poor entrepreneurship environment, backstabbing coworkers, all about politics and perception, not contribution."
good,"You have a mediocre hourly pay but you are required to make a certain sales goal (open new accounts, new credit cards etc) regardless of the declining economy, the sales goals are raised each year. If you don't make the sales goals you will be fired."
good,A typical day at work involves answering a high volume of telephone calls and solving moderate to complex transactions. Required sales goals in place.
good,"wells fargo is a good co to work with, but they dont pay you very well, and its very hard to get promotions, every year they had increased only few cents which is not fair. the work you do is vary more than what you get paid."
good,"The job itself is wonderful. My team is my second family and the customers are the icing on the cake. There are challenges as with any large company, but you have a built in support system."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Not all management cares about their teams. If you have children you better have a care taker bc they are too strict on attendance and adherence. Some great people that work with you, while you wonder how others where even hired. Pay is very decent for it being SC. Need more scheduling time-frames that work."
good,It’s not too bad for the job it’s super simple and you have to be simple but the pay is horrible compared to the amount of work we do. Paid time off is amazing as well as paternity leave but that’s the only good benefits
good,"Wells fargo is still trying to sort out its issues and it is immediately evident after you are hired and meet the ""team"". The Bank has different groups that seem to work against each other"
good,"You are basically a drone at work, besides the intermittent kindergarten level team building activities (such as; arts & crafts, scavenger hunt, bingo, and show & tell)."
good,I started as a personal banker.  After 2-3 years I was promoted to Service Manager.  I had a great repoire with my co- workers as well as my tellers.  I was able to increase their sales production tremendously.  I believe WF has changed their extremely challenging sales goals for their bankers and tellers.
good,The company is a good company to work for with the benefits they offer but currently my managers aren’t the best this is the reason I’m searching g for a new job
good,WFH No back up. During  code  deployment massive amounts of  documentation was required. Focus  was on documentation and  not quality code. Training  was non existant.
good,"In terms of salary and benefits it is at the bottom of the scale with her competitors.  The company will keep on adding many new functions to the job without any pay raise. "
good,"I enjoyed the wealth of knowledge and growth I gained from working for this department. However, this department had multiple turnovers and was also very understaffed. It was great having all the responsibility I was given but very stressful not having all the help we desperately needed."
good,"Very Stressful place to work."
good,"If you enjoy talking to people and is really good with handling money or being as thorough as possible then this is the job for you  A LOT OF DRAMA SO BEWARE. Not flexible with hours so there’s that. Not a bad job but it could be much better. Management is not up to par, and be ready to hear about how crooked Wells Fargo is for the past history even if the company has made effects to change it."
good,It was a good company to work for to get started with career and development. Management at times were abrasive and did not know the functions well enough to train individuals correctly.
good,"I am paid well for the work I do. My work would be better if I was better supported, or when I had questions about my job they would be answered. My manager is incompetent and I'm not sure whose idea it was to hire him, but it's very obvious he's never had management experience before."
good,Misrepresentation and deceptive sales tactics. They lied about bonus and changed compensation twice and deviate from contract when hired. They would Want clients in managed accounts rather than other products. It would be an act of god to get the client into a bond or MF.
good,"Make decisions on suspicious activity determine if customer has been been become a victim of identity theft. Analyzes, researches and review work provided by team members and other lines of businesses. I have leaned to monitor and identify patterns of anomalies and trends for "
good,"While the compensation and benefits are great, the culture is toxic. Management puts more stock in time in role than they do in actual skill and performance. Unless you are willing to relocate, upward mobility is impossible."
good,WF is OK for short-term contracts but not for career minded. Best for 6 month contract then you can decide if you want to continue.  Working Remote if fine but working onsite at CIC in Charlotte is a nightmare.
good,"If you are new to banking. Got to wells. They have the best training programs, and they promote at an obscene speed. Everything moves faster there. My sales requirements were 8.25 sales per day, and I had hourly check ins to make sure that I was on target. Easiest part of the job is prospecting in their massive easy to use interface. The hardest part of the job is being away from your family. They own you while you work for them, and they know it. "
good,There was room to grow with company but not under the management that was there at the time.  I wanted to retire from here but oh well. We had a really good district manager at the time.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,They have favorites in the company. If you are not willing to suck up to management all the time it is hard to move up and they play favorites so they put more work on certain employees while others do nothing.
good,This position gave me an opportunity to gain new skills however the schedule was intense and ultimately the reason I decided to leave.  Good short term.
good,"Brought in by Wells Fargo as a Contractor for Apex Systems."
good,"Toxic Management is all about micromanaging and have no clue how to give any recognition of performance just what the person does wrong. HR has no backbone regarding retaliation.They have you carry laptop home every day but have no flexibility to work from home. Campus is big but parking is limited. They have a gym but you pay for it. No area for working moms who breastfeed."
good,"I was a personal banker at a very busy branch, the day consisted of servicing clients throughout the day and trying to get as many sales as possible.  There was extreme pressure on every employee, the district managers would put the pressure on branch managers, the branch managers then put the pressure on the bankers, so on and so forth.  Even with all that I still think of my time there very fondly, the pressure on all employees made us form a real bond, I still have many friends that I met while working at Wells Fargo."
good,"Management is a joke, they hire anyone to ""lead"". Not much room for advancement. Thoughts, opinions, feedback not encouraged. Ehh type of employer. That is all."
good,Typical corporate place. Jobs come and go. Bonus taken away. Hard workers overlooked for promotions...instead promotions were given to those that were favored.
good,"Wells Fargo is great if you can actually keep your position. They are downsizing heavily. Benefits are great but are being cut down, management is also sometimes very questionable."
good,Pay at that time was terrible.  You only made good money when you were able to get a past due customer to pay a bill. As you can imagine that was hardly never. You need to have strong sales skills to be successful here.
good,"I love working for the company just did not agree with the managers and pay but miss the company the environment and the pay and benefits. products within company and industry guidelines. "
good,District Manager was only concerned with sales and not what the customer needed and required you to open and sell more than needed. Therefore the stress levels were very extreme because I had to deal with the ethical aspects of doing what was right for the client and what the DM wanted you to do.
good,Wells Fargo was a well known brand name to work for and good colleagues at that time. Would definitely like to work again if given the opportunity to.
good,"I worked for Wells Fargo for two years at a pay rate of 11.00 to start ending in 12.00."
good,"busy and fast paced environment"
good,"Set expectations since day one! "
good,"worked well with other team member . company was going thru rough times was focused on sales and not customer service driven "
good,"It was not a nice environment.  Management did not cultivate employment advancement and training.  I did not feel valued, nor was I compensated as such.  It felt as if people went to work to do the bare minimum."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Truly was an awful place to work. While the company and its shareholders receive insane profits and bonuses, the hourly employees are treated poorly. The quest of middle management for great numbers results in unhappy employees who are continually ignored. The work week requirements were insane."
good,Learned a lot but they replaced all their senior sales agents with fresh out of college at a lower pay scale. The very public scandal(s) are very real and damage the commission us sales agents received.
good,It was an okay job but didnt pay enough for what was requred.  I worked 5 days a week and no weekends but it was hard getting time off.  If you didnt have seniority then you didn't get any holidays off or fridays or mondays.
good,"As a mortgage closer, you are constantly being monitored by management and LO's.  It is a thankless position, as you are just a part of the mortgage cycle.  At the time culture was not good, as the sales force was creating unauthorized accounts. Pay is low, and employees are overworked."
good,"A typical day at work was learning something new every day. When I started working in Dealer Services now Dealer Auto there were no updated policies or procedures in place, so it made the job more difficult to do then it actually was. Management did not interact with the employees as much as they should have. We had a very diverse working environment. The hardest part of the job was no structure. The most enjoyable was team building events."
good,"It is a very great diverse place to work. In my current position I have recently learned there is really no room for  growth, or promotions. The other issue is under appreciation. Very hard working employees are not appreciated as they should be."
good,"Great Experience, The culture here is phenomenal. The message is all about how the people make the difference and the company is very focused on developing employees."
good,Great place to work and start a career. Lots of fun to be there and the people are fun to work with. the benefits are good but could always be better.
good,Working there is ok but to impeove your career is very hard .Wells fargo opens their new positions for their favorite people ONLY. They hardley give the position to whoever. But they still technically do all the process and interview people just to make it look fair to everyone while the truth is that they know who is going to hire .it is very frustrating.
good,"The job started off good, then poor management and no room for advancement and unhealthy work environment caused me to resign. It was turning more into the benefits of the branch manager instead of the team."
good,Not a bad place to start. Terrible place to stay. Soak up any financial knowledge and training they are willing to send you to. It will help you secure a better job with a better company.
good,They will allow or should I say push to to work as much as you will let them.  I gave them far to much of my life before pushing back and then they off shored my position.
good,Management is micromanaged. For example I was greeted at the door from going to the bathroom by my manager who asked me where I was and then got in trouble and went to the office and told I need a doctors excuse for going to the restroom too many times. I had only used the restroom one time that day and it was early morning.
good,micro management takes away incentive and creativity. Workday is flexible but management drive took away from experience to deploy with customer base. Incentives were realistic
good,"In sourcing, there is an unwritten expectation to work weekends, evening, etc.  there is currently no one else trained to do my job; andI am expected to cover even when on PTO."
good,I worked for Wells Fargo many years ago when sales goals were extreme and bankers were doing anything to hit quota. Its was not a healthy work environment then.
good,"Management cares more about money than employees, understanding that you employees are you most valuable asset,  Happy employees need to feel valued.."
good,"Wells Fargo is a wonderful company to work for. In my experience it is extremely difficult to advance in the company, which is what I’ve been trying to do for the last three years."
good,This is a perfect place to work for someone who just wants a daily routine and doesn’t have high expectations of himself or others. It’s a daily grind that will produce income of that is all you want. Just do what you are told even if it doesn’t make any sense.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I have not worked for Wells Fargo in the past five years. I do not know what changed. I have no current comment about the work day, what I learned, management or workplace culture."
good,"Typical work day was meeting heavy, but much of it could have been eliminated by using email for much of it. "
good,No leadership and direction in my department. The management has not provided leadership to continue with moving forward with my career at wells fargo. I am looking for something more challenging
good,"Very cliquish culture"
good,You are only a number at Wells Fargo. To much ramp up and ramp down. Managers are not well trained. Only whats good for then and not the employees. Hours are ok.
good,"With everything in the media and how they are still pushing us behind the scenes they do not pay anywhere near enough to any position. quarterly compensation has gone down the tube. there are no jobs open ever anymore. management has forgotten how to communicate. I was always worried I was getting in trouble for something. "
good,I was employed by Apex Systems to supervising security patching project upgrade. There were seven other team members assigned to this project. The project utilized excel to document and test patches. No current network or application tools were utilized to preform tasks.
good,"When I worked at Wells Fargo, it was during the time that people in California were opening fake accounts to meet their monthly quotas. My branch never did that but my managers were very cutthroat and we were short staffed for almost a YEAR that I worked there. So I was working full time but under the status of a part time. I was only given the amount of PTO that a part time teller would get even though I worked my butt off. Another thing was the policies. My managers would force me to enforce certain policies to our customers but when a customer would get upset, my manager would come over and always make an ""exception"" and make me look like the bad guy. I hated looking like I was the person doing wrong when I was just trying to follow protocol."
good,employees seemed to feel like numbers and not appreciated as people. advancement mostly depended on social ties and not knowledge or skill. i miss my coworkers the most.
good,"Although I enjoyed working with members of the wells fargo team, I often found that standards would be set by management who were less than capable of being accountable for themselves much less upholding the standards they set. The team members made the workplace fun, though I didn't feel like my growth with the company was taken seriously by my supervisors, unfortunately."
good,"Wells Fargo Auto Collections  is by far the worst entity to work in Wells Fargo in Irving, Texas. 90% of the supervisors are no where to be found to take a sup call or when you need help. Your chained to your desk and they monitor your bathroom breaks. The supervisors gossip and tell confidential information.. No respect for your privacy. They don't coach you to succeed..they write you up without warning. It's a paper trail to coach you out to protect their job. None of the sups have the skills to train their team for advancement and growth. No team recognition outside of an email. Nobodies on the same accord. They need to clean house with the management team and out source because it's too messy and too many new sups don't live up to wf vision and values. The new site leader is doing her best but it's too much kryptonite. Outside of that.. The pay and benefits are good and your if lucky you may get an ok schedule. It's either you work Saturdays or your there 11 hours! If you stay to yourself network and post out after 9 months your good"
good,"This is difficult to write at this time. For 9 of the 10 years I was employed, my job satisfaction was always met. The last year was completely devastating, it was the worst environment I have ever experienced. I was let go on false terms."
good,"Constantly changing priorities and shuffling organizational structures.  Uncertain management knows what to do next, so they reorganize.  A very immature controls environment which has created a lot of pushback.  They have added a lot of upper management people from Chase presumably to change the culture.  It's changed alright but not for the better.  Wells Fargo has a long way to go."
good,"The best part of this job was interacting with the customers and getting to know them. I enjoyed making small talk with them and even enjoyed seeing the regulars come in with their friendly faces."
good,"If the managers did not like you, they did not care to help you succeed. I would not recommend this job to anyone I know. Nor will I work for Wells Fargo again."
good,"Over the years the culture and moral has went way downhill, job is very unstable. Needs better management, employees are very skilled manager have no knowledge of the job or how to rub the department."
good,"None no much to tell I just don't remember much, I wish HMC were paid a salary + commissions with out having to repaid the actual draw and better medical benefits."
good,"Sell sell sell at all cost is their motto. If you are not pushing accounts and credit cards on people, you will not have a job long. Either you will quit because no matter how much you sell it is never good enough or they will fire you for not pushing accounts on every single customer"
good,"The bank feels like a family. Everyone gets along. It gets very busy at my location. Managers are nice, and peers are always looking for ways to help each other."
good,We all know how it played out thanks to the media. There was a lot of unrealistic pressure to sell products and the In-Store division had unrealistic goals where your job was at risk if not performing to goals.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"being employed by wells fargo was great overall but due to management in the town where i worked, they were all one sided and did whatever they needed to in order to get me to leave."
good,I left the company several years ago.  Its a joke now.  Company is nly hires young people so that they can manipulate and pay less.  Managers are a joke.  Barely coming out of either high school or college.  Expertise is no where to be found.
good,Wells Fargo goes in phases and is growing into a larger bank. The information security has grown from a small I.T. department to a a governance entity responsible for regulations. Thus it is an environment in flux.
good,"Very low pay per standards in the industry. Fast-paced environment where almost everything is a rush. Strict, but antiquated, guidelines used to measure performance."
good,Loyalty is not appreciated. Time and dedication for the job does not matter when they want cheaper labor. All the new changes are not totally follow because team members are receiving contradictory information.
good,"highly dissatisfied with current branch manager"
good,"Management lacked a lot in the area of understanding a work-life-work-school balance."
good,"When I worked at this company all they cared about were sales, sales, sales.  My manager would make us stay and call customers if we did not have our goal met.  Once a week we needed to work until 7 pm so we could make calls and set appointments for customers to come in."
good,"My Supervisor was fairly new in his position, he did okay but didn't always have the answers and was a little nervous when going over numbers/ stats.  Feel like he could have had more experience or someone in his one on one meetings"
good,"You are just a number. The company really doesn't care about employees. Everything is geared toward protecting management."
good,"worked in the call center as an online customer service rep... was way more of a salesman than a customer service rep and management could care less about the actual customer service provided, only thing they cared about was what we sold to the customers. And then you make all these sales for them and get paid just as poorly as a banker who sold nothing... no compensation for your hard work, wells fargo is a joke"
good,"In my period was a lot pressure to sale, the customer services was a second option and the goals was high and the money low. Still I have good friends from Wells Fargo, more that 50% of them, left WF."
good,"They pay their employees decently and give decent PTO, but they don’t like to promote people within their branches. I enjoy the type of work that I do as a teller."
good,"Unfortunately in working with large banks, their is always a high turn over and they do not want to pay for your worth.  They will pay someone that has no experience in the same position making almost as much as you."
good,Workplace culture always causes high stress levels by Senior/Mid level management
good,"You will enjoy the majority of the people here, but if you expect to get paid fairly for equal work, you should look elsewhere. I’ve been in my current position for 2 years and am one of the more seasoned reps.. they raised the middle point of our job (which is basically what you try to get close to when you apply) but failed to increase my pay to match... meaning that any new person can come into my dept with NO experience and make more than me."
good,"Management needs to be on the same page. They are constantly contradicting themselves from one another. Favoritism is seen day in and day out.  Management does not do anything to create one team, they are very selective of team member engagement. Hardest part of the job is going above and beyond the job responsibilities but it never being enough to please management. Lack of professional development. They want all employees to work identically, not allowing you to implement your own personality in the professional development. Not consistent with scheduled lunches, most days team members go over the 5th hour."
good,"In my 7 years at Wells Fargo, I have one overall take away - the company has several managers, but very few leaders. The difference should be known. The Company talks a big game about being an ""inclusive meritocracy"" during the interview process, but try to apply for a position outside of your division and you are stonewalled with very limited follow up."
good,Policy for Wells Fargo employees and customer changed daily.  For employees to meet the daily demands of Wells Fargo chair holder was stressful for me.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I took early retirement from this company after putting in almost 30 years.  I have been away for 2 years now, I feel I can't give an accurate opinion at this point."
good,The people were enjoyable to work with.  The management did not help with work life balance and made the culture of a work environment hard to stressful.
good,Wells Fargo got into trouble because of their false promise of giving sound financial advice. It was only to sell people products. They underpaid their staff which then required employees to sell these products for minimal bonuses. This came from the top down and was used to assure investors that their stock value would always increase.
good,when working for Wells Fargo. i realized i was pregnant with my son. i found out 2 months after starting their. the location i was at had an  asbestos room and had asked me to organize it. as you may know it is a area not suited for person that is pregnant to be in but i was doing what i was asked. In turn i left cause the company seem to take long to process the complainants as well as there employee problems.
good,Unrealistic production goals that are way too high as evidenced by the scandal with employees creating fake customer accounts.................................
good,"The work hours and work days made it difficult to have a balance between work and personal life. The pay rate is low for tellers and the advancement options are minimal and in my personal experience by favoritism.  Management was too young to actually manage, but was great at being a boss. She knows the business but she does not know her/his employees. "
good,"A typical work day consisted of people not showing up, no consequences were given, other than having to carry their work load. Then be reprimanded for having overtime. The pressure for pushing sales to those who did not need the products was infuriating."
good,A very stressful work environment that keeps you walking on eggshells at all times.  The compensation and benefits are good so that is the extent of what they give to their employees.  Working here breaks you emotionally due to the low moral.
good,Wells Fargo does not always put in place the correct management for the position required.  It is more about WHO you know vs. What you know.  Working 10+ hrs per day leaves little time with family or any type of work life balance.  Wells Fargo does have good benefits and after 12 months (if you make it that long) you can post out for a different position.  In my experience there is alot of job hopping.
good,telecommute was taken away after 6 years. upper management is shady and controlling. felt like we had babysitters and not managers. being a high producer I was not treated well
good,"Wells foundation for success are : Product is service, Wells  value added is financial advice and guidance,  Wells competitive advantage is our people"
good,i really have nothing to say. I will not recommend this job to any one or maybe it is just that location. there is no work life balance at all and this made it difficult to work for
good,If you get hired on its a great company but if your only a temp it's miserable how unfairly they treat employees to contract employees. It'd be nice ro be offered paid days off for holidays. Or not give FTE's extra days off when contract employees were not offered the same.
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to build skills in banking and there are opportunities for career development. There are also many opportunities to join programs and committees for personal development.
good,good experience but at the time the sales goals were selfish in nature and unattainable.  hopefully in the future the banking culture will change.   Stress intensive mental work.
good,"Being a contractor, it is tough to work in my current team. Few of the challenges faced by me are micromanagement, time management without any relaxation over work completed, no compensations for extra hours, ""U do what I say"" attitudes from the managers"
good,"My typical workday consists of working with customers with different needs (financial, payroll, etc.).  I enjoy the benefits and the co-workers I have met in the past 8 years working for the company."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I have to say that I was excited to work there. Unfortunately, the local office that I worked at wasn't not a hospitable environment. Don't get me wrong, the company itself was awesome and I really didn't want to leave but, it didn't provide a healthy environment.. There is one person in the office that decides if you are going to make it or not. If they like you, you are good to go. If they don't then hold on and watch your back. There is a lot of ' Do as I say and not as I do' there. Either way, Wells Fargo is a great company and if you are in the right area you will love it. I hope that you have a better experience than a number of us had. Good luck."
good,"Typical day as any other day in the mortgage industry.  Underwrote loans, search guides, reviewed conditions.  Cleared loans to go to closing department."
good,"Most people who work here are contract employees. You have to wait until spots open up in order for you to move up. It was a clean place to work, but often heard that coworkers was stealing peoples food."
good,District Manager encouraged pushing financial products like loans on clients that they didn't want or need.  She had risen to her job because she was a strong salesperson but she lacked basic financial knowledge.
good,"On dailer on a daily bases, make payment arrangements, leave messages. Learned how to be an effective  collector, hardest part of job setting acceptable  payment arrangements that were possible for customers t keep.. Most enjoyable getting bonuses."
good,"The days were spent in a small cubicle on the phone a lot of times with irrate customers.  Way too much of my time was spent on the phones with tech support for system issues instead of helping customers.  Supervisors always had so much to do they were not available or knowledgeable about issues that came up for us so we were  told to go to the website, or call tech suppport for asistance concerning customer care and system issues.   I did learn about federal banking regulations and what companies not to use a debit card with.  I really liked  all the people I worked with, many of which have remained my friends.   Sadly only 3 of the 24 I started with remain with the company 10 months later mostly due to strict handling times and the harsh schedule."
good,"I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with. Management was very disconnected and only willing to coach favorites. To me it seemed very artificial and sexist, in order to advance you have to be a beautiful woman."
good,"As a branch teller, you get hired to open accounts for all your friends and family, and then all their friends and their other side of the family every day. When that referral source dries up, your manager will not let you go home if you don't close a single credit card, checking or saving account that day. Oh, I forgot, you're supposed to cross sell 1 account for every hour that you're clocked in."
good,Very large risk effort ongoing.  Jobs available in risk. Culture has been a focus recently as the problems have arisen and hit the news agencies.  They are working hard to resolve.  Good benefits.
good,The most aggressive sales culture ever encountered.  Conference calls three times a day and mid day check in to ensure that staff were meeting quotas for sales goals.  Was actually threatened by senior leadership with daily dismissal for not meeting sales quotas by noon.
good,"There were so many opportunities where Wells Fargo could have done the right thing for their customers in regards to loans and bank accounts but didn't. If you approached your manager with questions then your could risk your job. Currently, Wells Fargo is changing their business practices to more positive experiences for their customers."
good,"Management tries to compensate with juvenile rewards (candy, certificates, lunches), but the stress of taking 45 minute - hours long phone complaints is not physically or mentally healthy. It is inhumane to expect employees to field complaints and complex issues for hours without self-scheduled breaks."
good,"Management had some issues, enjoyed the team, enjoyed the customers, learned alot, there was alot of favoritetism, working to help customer financially, enjoyed working without supervision, when you voiced your opinion, you got wrote up"
good,"The Manager I had was the 2nd manager in the 2-1/2 years I was there.  He tried to get us to lie on the number of realtor calls we did. He even told one of the new employees that his 3 month sign on was based on a 50 hour work week and to just ""throw some numbers in here and there like on Saturdays""."
good,My manager was very biased and unfair. It made the entire atmosphere and job very difficult to do.......................The job itself wasn't bad except for the goals were always unobtainable without the proper training which we did not receive. It was very stressful and like being in prison.................So many people went out on STD because of the work conditions and managers.
good,"Company is constantly changing job titles, descriptions, and duties required of its employees.  Also, daily work procedures change frequently slowing down job productivity.  Sales quotas were initiated after Wells Fargo/Wachovia merger, which I believe, forced the Wells Fargo representative to focus on meeting set quotas instead of focusing on the customer's needs."
good,Working with wells fargo was  good experience overall. There were a few issues with inner management and how employees where treated. There was also a huge rat infestation which made it uncomfortable to work. The position was being held over your head daily with new procedures.
good,I only worked there for a few months as a teller but it was too slow pace environment at the location I was at. A typical day had a small rush around lunch hour and scattered mini rushes. I didn't like that if a customer walked up to the counter asking to open an account it was not considered a sale.
good,"Base pay of $30,000 + uncapped commissions.  However, management fails to adjust comp structure to align with the current market.   HMCs are currently working in a toxic environment making $100k less than in previous years, putting in 10X as much work for the little income now being generated."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Enjoyed the Relationship Managers, very positive about deciding who I was to try to get to switch to Wells or to try to get a loan or line of credit. Lots of services could be offered."
good,"Upon arriving company gives you 15 min to initially start your comp and programs & read all your emails.  Receive a huge volume of calls.  Handle inquiries concerning anywhere from deposits, errors made inside the branch,  help in restoring or setting up online accounts, pass words or inquires. Take care of fraud issues concerning checks or debit card, or deposits. Answer questions concerning balance & account information, merchants, electronic debits, transfers, direct, & cash deposits.  Offer services & other types of accounts that may benefit the member.  Open checking account, savings, money market accounts, cd, applications for credit cards, offer mortgage, credit card & mortgage refinancing.  Company's primary focus is completely on sales than it is on service, 90/10 percent. Management was helpful.  The hardest part of the job is the high sales expectations with a bank clientele who lacked the kind of income that would allow them to take advantage of other financial products. Also very low interest rates returned offered in their products.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the coworkers."
good,"As a friend put it, Trust Ops is a ""toxic environment"".  Very true.  Terrible leadership, inconsistent direction, lack of understanding of tasks, isolated.  Stay away!"
good,"Having your superiors breathe down your neck 24/7 is very stressfull. I wish I could've enjoyed working there, because my co-workers at my first location and managers were all wonderful. It was the rules they had us on and the ""daily goals"" were all the kill joy. I hope its doing better now that when i was working there."
good,Extremely sales driven. Very good training. But cannot retain employees. Very difficult to do mortgage due to turn around times and extremely strict underwriting and processing guidelines.
good,Meet new people and customers and co workers become like family. Recognition is high on the companies list for job well done. You have avenues in which to be promoted.
good,They see people as just numbers and they treat you as such. Youre disposable. I was the only one in my group who was not trained properly and it showed. My preformance suffered due to this. The manager was working less hours than I was every single week. The hardest part was getting along with so many personalities and not letting it sweep you into the highschool drama that is sure to ensue. I did however enjoy some of the relationships I built with the customers.
good,"Compensation is very well but need more job work/life balance, I worked very long and hard hours. By the time I got home was to tired to have time with my family."
good,Not the best leading employer.  They definitely put a lot of pressure on you which is why they have the ongoing customer complaints.  They do not stick to their word.
good,The culture at Wells Fargo can be very interesting at times.  We take a lot of classes and are constantly learning new things along with policies and procedures on how to do our job better.
good,"Fast paced, high-pressure sales oriented job. Mandatory overtime for 2+years. Mandatory sales quotas, high turnover. Revolving door policy. Very stressful. (As seen on recent news headlines)"
good,"Wells Fargo was an efficient place of business.  It is preferred for those with a passion for banking and sales.  Very competitive environment with plenty of opportunity for growth.  The pressure to meet goals was sometimes overshadoeing the morality of the workplace however."
good,"If you have a desire to learn , sky's the limit. You make your own career. It's important you have a destination and work toward it. Be curious and gain substance."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my time with Wells Fargo was the friendships that I gained working there. I gained valuable customer service and administrative experience. Management was severely lacking and never held accountable. Favoritism is shown heavily from branch to branch. There is no consistency between branches and poor work ethic. I worked there for almost a decade. Out of the many branch and service managers that I worked with, sadly only a very, very few were well-rounded and did their jobs morally, ethically, and took care of their customers and team-members. I hear that the work culture has changed over the last year or so. I hope that is true."
good,Great people and culture.  Hard work rewarded.  Great work life balance.  Middle Management is excellent.  Top Management is typical of the industry. Recommend.
good,Was told to cross-sell to every person I interacted with.  Was penalized when the customer was not interested in our other products.  Was micromanaged by direct supervisor.
good,"If you suffer from any ailment, disability or illness, WF will show you that they are empathetic and supportive.  When behind the scenes, they use it against you in your yearly reviews (as a poor team player), and you cannot move either laterally or elsewhere in the company."
good,Enjoyed working with the team and customers. The job was a little stressful at times due to the pressure and risk from customers placing trades. Overall a decent company.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I enjoyed everything I learned and gained from not only in my work life but also my personal life. I gained a lot experience and insight on how to achieve goals I had never even dreamed of.
good,My experience was working for Wells Fargo through a temp agency. Pay was average to above average through the agency. Work/Life balance was firm but fair.
good,Looking for something new. Ready for a change of pace and change of environment. New challenges and new responsibilities. In need of increased compensation.
good,it was great working with people everyday.  you would start to form a relationship with the nice members.  everyday we would learn something new.  it was ok.
good,they don't care about their employees. Everyone who works there is just a number. You can rapidly move up in the company is you preform well but have a bad day week or month and you job can become on the li
good,"Overall a good company however severe inconsistency in a work day, senior management was bias in many forms. My personal gratification was assisting my staff in their  personal and professional development."
good,Management does follow motto they describe.  Wells Fargo Advisors do not treat clients with respect.  I enjoyed working with the Financial Advisors I worked with.  They were very respectful and appreciated my tenacity.  The hardest part of the job was getting co-workers on board with providing excellent service to clients.
good,It is my experience that Wells Fargo was perfect for when I needed to have that job.  If given the chance I would work there again.
good,I enjoyed the customer interactions and relationships I got to build. That allowed me to grow my experience in sales and in customer service
good,"I worked as a teller in Billings, Montana 10 years ago,  and i loved it because my supervisor was an awesome leader."
good,Not a job I would stay at for a long time but a good place to work while in school. Store policy is always changing and management style is inconsistent. Employee moral is average.
good,Wells Fargo provides the necessary tools to do an effective job.  The compensation is poor for the industry.  People are promoted based on tenure not ability. Management is not knowledgeable in product and programs
good,"Sale goals "
good,Was a employee there for almost 10 years or so. Don't think I will return sales are not my favorite. The sales was more important thank the values.
good,"I had great coworkers and that made the tasks of the job bearable. There was transparency about when performance reviews took place and how they related to an increase in pay. The location transferred and there was no parking, an increase in taxes paid, and the amount given to cover this substantial increase in cost to the employee was minimal and didn't help"
good,"I used to love working here, however with the changes in the recent year and a half or so, things have really gone down hill. It isn't change that is the problem, it is the lack of training that is given to adapt to that change that has made this job go down hill."
good,"A typical day was dealing with customers and transactions with their accounts. I learned that there are places where no matter how hard you try that a small mistake will always count for more than one hundred successes."
good,"I absolutely loved my job with Wells Fargo for the first year. I thought I would retire from this company... until my supervisor and team lead both went to other departments and I was placed under another supervisor."
good,The home preservation role works best for someone who works well behind a computer with job parameters and limits. If you have accelerated promotion expectations be aware you will be held in your current position for 1 full year so be patient and humble.
good,"During Tax Season they hire numerous people to help advise their clients where their 1099's are at and what they can expect to see on their forms. You start in a classroom setting which helps you understand and learn what people are looking for specifically, then you are assigned a desk and phone. You take incoming calls from Financial Advisors and help navigate them through the system to find what the clients are looking for. If a company sold to another you have to figure the dividends for the advisor so they can advise their clients of the change and their gain or loss."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"As far as Management, they pushed high sales goals, and wasn't trust worthy, for team members, and customers. Promotions were far, and few in between."
good,"Your chances of moving up are very slim, since it is a nation wide company Laredo is limited to positions...but one thing for sure is management sucks and so to the raises! Other than that my coworkers were like family"
good,Company expects for you to go above and beyond but doesn't adequately compensate for work. Long hours and very stressful.
good,"Limited room for growth"
good,"When I started with Wachovia it was the best job I ever had good pay good worklife balance yes we had sales goals but they weren't everything, then came Wells Fargo"
good,"Expect your work days to be focused around hitting arbitrary sales goals from the very beginning of the day to the very end of it. Store managers are just under as much pressure as you are to go ""above and beyond"" in customer service, but, most importantly, sales metrics."
good,Wells Fargo in the end was very stressful. My duties were in the area of the Government program HAMP (Home Modifications) and that program was ending 12/2016. Staff reduction
good,"Typical day at work: pipeline management, follow up with markets of Utah and Washington State. Prioritized workflow, prepare documents, booking, funding."
good,"Compensation is significantly lower than others in the field completing the same job.  Was told by management that I was not worth a .25/ hour raise because that was too much of a raise.  "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the family environment , the hardest is the politics involved and not being challenged enough by a job that requires you to think. Management can be great but a degree is not needed to be in management, and although many managers do have one, many struggle to actually be a leader."
good,"training felt rushed, locked into one position without advancement opportunity, job performance counted for nothing, released without exit interview"
good,You have to multi task at a fast pace and sells pressure. I learned about financing. The most enjoyable part in the PTO. Management can be good but depends on what type of manager you get. The Sale goals are extremely high.
good,"A typical day is very boring.  You will not learn anything about banking or finance because Wells Fargo is about fee extraction.  Management is all about looking out for management, so they don't have any idea what they are doing.  Co-workers are good, but nobody stays long because of the overpaid managers."
good,"Working here was not all that great. If you like being constantly hounded about sales and feeling like you are screwing customers over, this place is for you. Don't work for any large Wells Fargos, go for the smaller ones. The pay is ok.. not much better than McDonalds. It is really nice getting to know your daily customers and the customer service part is awesome. Banking is a fun career but choose a smaller bank."
good,"	Review government loan’s documents including FHA & VA loans, and approves or suspends the loans after the underwriter decision."
good,"they say focus is primary on customer service but only topics discussed daily are sales goals and sales expectations. Coworkers are not strong team players and too many ""sharks"" bankers who sell useless products to all customers"
good,"long hours, no overtime is allowed so your work the hours but not get paid for your work. very bad upper management. bad business culture they want you shove products down peoples throats."
good,"While at Wells Fargo, I trained new employees, took calls and answered eails fro customers and government agencies.  Was an underwrtier for 6 months."
good,"Lots of corporate governances. No trust. No loyalty amongst long time staff. Very limited staff to deal with the day to day operations of the mandatory duties that is to be preformed by dual staff. My co-works were great new management was not so well, They were to much into the proper clicks. They looked after the people who bowed to there every word, Most of the long timers left or were forced to re-tire. Previously Wachovia and that was a great place to work."
good,"This was a contract position, work was good, same as before, I have learned much but used to work lot of hours including weekends.  People were nice and enjoyed working there.  Compensation was good too."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,great co workers but company sales goals are stressful and current management at my branch is terrible been trying to move up for months now and still stuck as a teller when people who just started are moving up because i can't be a wells fargo slave because i have a family
good,Wells Fargo is a very good company to work for. It is a great place for career growth. I would encourage any Business College graduate to join Wells fargo.
good,My time at JC Penney was not the greatest. It is an entry level job and there wasn't much room for advancement unless you have been with the company for several years.
good,Revolving door and limited opportunity for advancement in this department of Wells Fargo.  There is an opportunity to make a decent income here though.
good,My co workers were the main reason that I enjoyed coming into work each day. I also thank Wells Fargo to give me the opportunity as my 1st Mortgage Underwriting job as it is something that I had wanted to do for sometime.
good,"I don't recommend this job if you are a face to face kind of person. I love to help every customer that comes on my phone, but i would much rather see the person."
good,Not a place known for advancement.  Management is incredibly unorganized and not consistent with the company's stated values.
good,"I worked back when it was Cingular Wireless that turned into ATT wireless. The Cingular wireless days were great. When ATT took over, a lot more rules and stipulations applied."
good,A good place to work to get experience in the Customer Service field.  learned a lot in the mortgage field co workers are very nice and helpful
good,I loved my work in their government insuring department. Management was excellent and tried to make their employees happy. Very little room for advancement.
good,"•	Gain new business through outbound calls, in-person and partner referrals "
good,"Dysfunctional work environment at the branch level."
good,My job description was completely different than what was described or accepted. This position quickly turned to high stress sales.
good,a typical day was learning how to process loans and learning how to order flood certificates.
good,Managers definitely let the pressure of sales get to them. As a teller your job should be to refer products and have a personal banker close the deal. If for whatever reason the customer declines the product they expect you to present another product until the customer gets either overwhelmed and decides to sit with a banker or gets extremely upset and makes a scene.
good,"Non-profit equates to non-job security.  You will be ""Laid-Off"" if you've worked there long enough to make a descent salary."
good,"Work directly with third parties to coordinate in-flow of new repayment plans, and outflow of litigation referrals. "
good,If you are sales driven this is the place for you. The management is very aware of you  sales performance. You are accountable for sales avery few hours
good,Job Work/Life Balance was not in balance.  My management experience was not the best.
good,"The staff really depends on how well the managers deal with the rest of the team on respecting authority. There is no work/life balance. The sales goals for bankers are too high and unrealistic most days ( middle of the week) The chances of you getting promoted are slim in my opinion, and take a very long time to go thru once the managers agree that you should be promoted. Policies and procedures are always being changed, altered to liking or not implemented. Cliques are quick to form and are not accepted well. Also, if you gain a real friend at work, you're automatically being watched with a magnifiying glass! Overall I havent liked what I have seen..and ive seen alot. it is unfair most days, inconsistant and boring. the two managers ive had over the last 2 years are immature and need alot of help managing a team of people.Oh, and more than 1 Saturday as an off day per month or an extra day off during the week for the holidays( Veterans day, thanks giving, xmas)..FORGET ABOUT IT!"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo is a large West Coast bank. Currently they do not have banking powers in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which makes servicing clients banking requests challenging.  "
good,"Over all job was great.  Enjoy working with the employees and especially the customers. Typical day at work started with opening vaults, retrieving nite drop bags and atm envelops.  After retrieving the nite bags they would have to be logged in by two peoples and than assigned to tellers.  Next would be making sure the tellers had enough monies to start the day which also took two employees.  A morning huddle would commence and the day would begin.  My co-workers were great, they were very customer oriented and greeting the customer as they came to their window.  Management was minimum help when it came to working with tellers.  Service manager was not trained with the new computers and counted on their lead tellers to help.  The hardest part of my job was working with management.  I worked for the company 17 years and enjoyed my job.  Customer service and problem solving were the two parts of my job I enjoyed the most."
good,The Culture and policies have changed so its a constant changing work life... which is ok because it keeps you sharp...  The biggest challenge there is the processing...   Being in a commission position its frustrating when you operations staff keep dropping the ball...
good,"Upper management at Wells Fargo appears to be more concerned with number of accounts opened rather than number of happy customers. This was a regular difficulty for both tellers and bankers, and the reason for the extremely high turnover among employees."
good,"It isnt a terrible job until you've been here awhile.  Its the same thing everyday with little things that try to make things better, but they never do.  Everyone i know is trying to escape to new careers, because this job is just soul crushing."
good,I have learned and still learning default credit policy. I believe the company offers great opportunities to advance.
good,"Heads down great training classes and learning link."
good,"Provides learning center courses, operations new experience."
good,"Great Team Members, but the commission based pay was not structured."
good,Expected sooo much from this company and it set me up to fail.
good,"the job pays a decent amount, but it gets old very quickly and there isn't alot of room for promotions."
good,"From what I remember, there was a high demand sales culture, and was busy from open to close. The high turnover rate could pose a problem with the busy day to day. If you are able to meet sales goals and like the business of the day, the bonus is a plus."
good,"Call center, hard to get desired schedule, very fast paced and exhausting."
good,Very high turnover including management. Good benefits. Jobs are generally not well compensated. Very aggressive Banking Company.
good,managmenet role I learned how to deal with irrate customers and handle fraud
good,"I was hired away from IBM to underwrite for Wells Fargo. The income was on the low side, however, the plans for expansion and career stability were too tempting. I was hired on along with an additional 30 people which eventually became an additional 170 new hires. training was condensed and sometimes confusing. I've been in the industry for over two decades so I was able to draw on previous knowledge and work experience. For those who were hired with minimal underwriting experience it was a tough time. Also faced with a brand new platform for file review and all processes surrounding mortgage production it soon became a divided enviornment. Many promises were made and not kept. Many people who had been in place for years went on to other companies. Management changed multiple times. Eventually in became clear too much hiring was done too fast with the idea the work would keep coming in but it didn't.  After a year I was laid off along with 2200 other people."
good,"Very tough sales environment. I had a lot of success at the company, and learned a great deal, but the environment and other employee talent and morale was terrible."
good,Audit the Loan Document Specialist work to ensure that all the file is complete. Do special projects at work researching the true amount of time a file is reviewed and completed.  Constant change on the work standard therefore a time study test is always in place.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"attended daily sales meetings, logging planners, networking customers, keeping up with latest bank products, checking daily bank leads. I learned training and practices. Management was always fun and engaging. co workers were great to hang out with and very professional. My pay and compensation was very poor. I did enjoy the customers and the lasting business relationships."
good,"This place is depressing. After giving my all for five years, being treated poorly, but still wanting to give the company my all, I called it quits. Hardest part of the job was dealing with management. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers. They were so pleasant, but they had no clue what kind of the treatment you were experiencing."
good,"The work enviornment isn't as relaxed as most people would like. Very goal and sale oriented team. If you're a top performer, you'll do well, but be careful. Management is not effective, micromanagement is one of the biggest areas that need to be addressed."
good,"Typical sales - bring the customer in for a product, up sell products and achieve quotas"
good,i assist people on making the best choices for them and their accounts.
good,"for the most part is is a good job but some locations do have a divide between management and employees. My co-workers are great and have many things that make them a great asset to the company, but with a company that is so sales driven and concerned with everyday sales, they tend to look past these aspects that each individual brings to the table and forget about them. Some management does a diservice to their employees which  unfortunately in turn is reflected onto the customer."
good,"The hardest part of the job is to keep up with compliance changes, collecting above standards and be healthy all in one day."
good,Great team work but not enough team effort at wells fargo I felt like I was the only one getting sales and meeting my quote daily but my team was not so it would then make me look bad because of the team I was on.
good,"Based on the amount of volume in loans brought in by loan agents, in comparison to the amount of employees to process, underwrite, pre-close, close and fund the loans. It is almost impossible to close a loan at wells fargo"
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work. The type of environment encouraged learning and provided ways to challenge your skills.
good,I took care of business and personel deposits and withdrawels.  Balance vault as well as cash drawer
good,Wells Fargo is a well established employer with a competitive corporate business model. I respect this company for achieving high levels of success in this challenging environment.
good,I have been here for a year and have come to realize everything they have told me about moving up fast and getting reckognized for what a good job you do is a lie! I was also told I was going to get paid 36K but come to find out they changed it to 34K much less then my co-workers. they micro-manage the place like crazy and even when you are succeeding and going above and beyond for this company it's not good enough for them. they show you all the money you can make on commission but they make the goals so ridiculously high that it's nearly impossible to meet and even get paid out for commission! moving up in this company doens't get you any where they only give you a 10% raise from what you are currently getting paid and refuse to negotiate so any salary you see for a postition you will never get realisticly.
good,"I process FHA, VA, Conventional and Rural Housing loans.  I review submitted loans prior to submitting to underwriting to ensure we are not missing signed forms, information and documentation needed for the file.  Once file is approved, I contact the borrowers to go over approval conditions and request what documentation is needed to satisfy underwriting.  Coordinate closing dates and generally work with the borrowers all through the process."
good,Opportunity to work with diverse people from all backgrounds.  Managing a team and working with great people.
good,Sales pressure to the max... They just promote managers that know how to sell they dont care about operations and everything else which makes alot of branches suffer..Pays the most in personal banker roles but company has a horrible way of treating employees
good,Considered an outsider -  this was addressed to all consultant in the financial services area.  I would never work for them again.
good,I was a bank teller with a manager who favored her friends and was very unfair to many employees. I enjoyed the company as a whole and my job since i was good at it.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I thought working in one office and transferring to another (out of state) would be so easy to do.  OMG...it was like working in a different company!  Nothing the same at all.  So basically I was a new employee on every level.  I missed the office I left so bad I cried! I could not go back b/c it was an out of state move.  Mandatory overtime was enforced on certain days but I could not work that particular day of the week but could the other 5 days of the week but no it had to be the day they chose.  Then I had 4 different managers within 12 months!!  All different, played by different rules too!"
good,Branch Manager high paced sales force with extreme expectations. Operationally sound top performing office
good,Ok place to work. Nice people. Micro managed to the hilt. You won't get two days off in a row when you start.
good,"high turn over and managment couldn't care less about you. The pay is good depending on the job, fast paced and very demanding."
good,Personally I loved the people I worked with and I thought the benefits were pretty good.
good,Work / Life Balance is horrible. Mgmt is always suspicious about everyone who works with this group. No trust.
good,My typical day at work is usually good. I learn how to put myself in others shoes and understand other peoples life styles and finances. As far as management they are pretty good with paper work. My co=workers i love but i know how to seperate business from friendships. the hardest part of my job is not having much help and much feed back when it comes to certain situations. Most enjoyable part is the customers cause i meet so many people everyday with situations like mines
good,Serve bank customers by accurately and promptly performing transactions while delivering exceptional customer service. Adhere to customer service protocols and processes. Actively participate with financial center team members and in daily huddles and team meetings to ensure that financial center goals are achieved.
good,Enjoyable work environment. Great team mates! Self motivated people.
good,"Customer service and sales, inventory as well as coaching. management was not to humbling but co-workers worked well."
good,"go in automatically get asked what your commitment or goal is for the day, management is ok, but never feels like they actually care. overall pretty amazing coworkers,"
good,I enjoyed my work and learning the mortgage process most of all I enjoyed helping people save money. However the position was an Interim position and the management team that was selected I felt as if they were unsupportive and showed favortism to some and not others.
good,"everything sounded great when i heard other associates talk about wells. so i jumped on the band wagon and for myself, its just been on a downward spiral. management is the reason why a lot of people leave their jobs to look for opportunities elsewhere"
good,"When I was at Wells Fargo Home Moratage. The first month , I was standing up scanning files such as FHA , OPERTIONS, SETTELMENTS, VA, FFI etc. Then after that 1 month, then I started my training on the computer and what I did on the computer is that after the files were being scanned then I would check the files and make sure that each paper was index under the correct one and to make sure that each paper was scan correctly."
good,"their really wasn't an enjoyable part of the job. i guess if you're looking for a part-time job while you're in school, then working at Wachovia was ok. otherwise...nope."
good,- Good company with lots of challenges
good,100% commission and sales oriented. Must work independently to obtain your financial goal.
good,bank work supervisor 10 agents
good,"Assist and manage customer home equity accounts. Collect or arrange payment options, negotiation, and/or modification assistance."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"enjoyed working with public, waited on customers in dining room. Weekends were busiest and fun. Restaurant had to cut back on budget so the waitresses had to do everything except cook food, which sometimes caused longer wait times for customers."
good,Decent place to work poor pay. The management was corrupt and used an ole boy buddy system to promote.
good,My co-workers were fantastic and I don't think I've ever had the experiences I've had with other coworkers that I've had with them.
good,Working in my department...you will never have a dull moment.
good,"Each work place is different but I think the higher up you get the more opportunity there is to focus and try to implement postivity and good values. However, on the local branch levels that was very toxic. You also feel like a robot doing all the transactions because it truly takes very little brain power to complete those tasks and you're essentially a glorified ATM."
good,"This is a company that shows favoritism to ""popular"" or well known people within the company for higher up positions. I know of people getting passed over on positions due to the manager knowing another person that they personally want to put in the position."
good,"After the Bank scandal and the reorganization, has been lots of  pressure, too much stress.  They are closing Branches and reducing Branch staff.  Overloading us with extra work, many task, goals and perfect customer service experience while taking away the products and services that we use to help our customer to succeed financially."
good,"The environment can be decent, but it can seem like just a job and nothing more. Advancement is very difficult when there is constantly a shortage of tellers."
good,"Fastpace and deadline driven environment, high stress working environment, very small chance of room for advancement, but despite these things good benefits overall."
good,"Working for Wells Fargo there are many different pros and cons depending what you are really looking for. If you can manage not having a set schedule weekly or you are okay with the constant waves of change that you're the face of ,its perfect. Job roles are unclear ever since the ""change for the better"" in 2018. The compensation does not suffice for the face level scrutiny you deal with from customers. It is micromanaged in every aspect as if you are incapable of performing your job role. The coaching is unclear and the benefits just couldn't make up for the lack of happiness manifesting each day."
good,"Work environment itself is ok. The only thing holding this job back is the lack of procedures and direction within the department where I'm currently at. We're constantly being told to do contradictory things on a daily basis for the most mundane and basics of tasks. It can be very frustrating and make for a stressful environment. Other than that, the job is just fine. Pay is decent."
good,"Wells Fargo has a diverse culture, but there are many politics that affect progression within. The benefits are very decent and available to employees on day one of employment, which I really appreciated."
good,"high stress, lots of contract workers from different places who only stay a few months, high turn over in groups and management.Culture is not spread across all departments."
good,"The company itself is absolutely humongous so I’m sorry to say , but they only used people for annual benefits enrollment and don’t give job offers due to the volume of calls decreasing , however in all of HR department I would think that if you were good at your job and a good employee you should be able to get another position"
good,If you can survive at Wells you can anywhere. Everything was sales focused with unrealistic goals and target numbers. This led to high turnover and we had to constantly hire throughout the year.
good,I have been with WF for 4 years and my current position I'm not happy in. Management doesn't really care too much about your development but still expects results. The only thing that I enjoy is helping customers and working together with my team for the customer.
good,"happiness highly depends on supervisors. Typical day at work, morning huddles, greeting customers, standing in the lobby welcoming, engaging in transaction and enhancing their exit. Workplace culture depends on supervisor, if they care enough to promote you. Hardest part of job is making sure there are no minor errors that could cost you your job. Most enjoyable part is working with different types of people."
good,Almost every other bank pays more than what they're willing to pay employees. Branch Manager was never around and had the service managers pick up the slack. I was the longest standing teller at this branch and I was only there for a year.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,This was a more than a fast-paced job where there was no real time for problem solving. There were such serious metrics that you had only a limited amount of time to do surface problem solving.
good,"Overall the work experience was okay, I worked at a time when the sales pressure was at its extreme and ethics/morale was ignored. Employees were forced to perform unethical sales."
good,I suppose it's ok once you are in. It's a bit difficult to move into a different department or to even get a promotion. A lot of office politics but nothing you wouldn't find at any other office. The benefits are great though.
good,"•	Responsible for all compliance and audit for a +$230 M/year business for 12 branches with 200 Financial Advisors and 100 support staff."
good,"I have worked in various departments  for WF. However, being in ck fraud is extremely challenging.  I recognize the importance of boosting morale but some managers didn't get the memo."
good,"Good Company to work for short period of time , but there is no technology advancement here . Legacy applications . "
good,"It is difficult to access this since I was a contractor working there.  I was not allowed to sit with the team I was working with or participate in any of the Wells Fargo functions.  There were two different contracts and I felt the same at each office, definitely noticed that contractors were not treated the same which is understandable.  The workplace culture was different for a contractor than an employee.  The most enjoyable part of the job was making some new friends."
good,"It was frustrating to work for this company because I worked in a Satellite office and there were few growth/advancement opportunities in this office. I also felt underutilized for my skillset and could have contributed more to this company. Salary increases were small commensurate at this company and due to their negative reputation in the industry, there was high turnover. Furthermore, employee morale"
good,"Management was not the best, they kept promising me a promotion that never seemed to happen until I gave my two weeks. The teller role is under paid and underappreciated. I would not recommend the retail side of Wells Fargo."
good,Clients were always rude and management demanded expectations that were non-realistic which led to disciplinary actions through no fault of your own. I will never consider working at a bank again.
good,Work is the primary orientation with this company and hitting your numbers. Keep in mind that you are very disposalable to this company and your team could be cut at any given time.
good,"The company was good if you have no experience, but it seems there is no room to grow. I've been with the company for 5 years and feel I have hit the ceiling. The salaries are very low compared to the cost of living. Managers always take ever other weekends off while the employees are forced to work 4-5 straight weekends. Managers are always in meetings while the employees are always on the hustle."
good,"great environment, paid time off, maternity leave. along with a well work life balance, enjoyed the relationships along with the long term skills i have developed"
good,"No such thing as work/life balance at the call center. Unrealistic expectations. The Higher managers are never welcoming, They make you feel like a tool."
good,"I worked in a call center for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. I excelled at me job and was backed up by quantified results and excellent QA grading. However, the worked place was very very stressful. It feels like you're in a fishbowl at all times. They make bombastic announcements about amazing positive work culture, but none of the management followed through with that. Once the team functions well together and reaches our goals with maximum efficiency, the goal post is pushed back to more and more impossible lengths. Additionally, they really push a false narrative when it comes time for gallup surveys. They push this mantra about what a 5 really means. It just felt like a workplace with 0 transparency."
good,"Everything was great until the bonus structure was eliminated, that when the job became uncomfortable. After the pay change, everyone became expendable to the company"
good,I was there when they were in trouble for bad sales culture and everything changed and everyone became lazy. Lost out in good amount of bonus money and management was not realistic.
good,"Employee at Wells Fargo, the goals were very hard to accomplish each Month, always felt like my job was on the line if i didn't meet them and it wasnt management it was coming from higher up"
good,"Wells Fargo is going through a lot of changes and it’s hard to know if you will still have a job. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"My time with Wells was split between Wells Fargo Bank and Wells Fargo Advisors (Brokerage). The brokerage part was great. They treated you like adults. Working for the bank side, it was push, push, push on the bankers. As their Supervisor I did not believe you should force a client into a sale that wasn't right for them. Ultimately I left because of conscious and I just had a baby. The timing seemed right."
good,Management doesn't know how to do your job so they can't coach you on your skills. Hard to get promotion without favoritism. Most peers have to work extra job just to get by. Benefits are ok but the level of stress and pressure to meet numbers does not make up for it.
good,Working for Wells Fargo Security was very productive but i will say that the job lacked in many areas. I felt that management didn't really take their jobs too serious as they let anyone call out at any given time which i found extremely strange. Also scheduling was a bit terrible. Overall it was a good experience to learn more about security as i began to develop love & passion for the medical field which i am now trying to move on to.
good,Wells Fargo is ok depending on the department you end up in and of course your manager. My last manager was a micro manager and wouldn't accommodate me with my needs to maintain a healthy work life balance even though she had the means to do so.... however there's a lot of departments in the corporate side of Wells and people should take advantage of that
good,This job pays the bills and supports a fairly okay lifestyle for a single mid-twenties person. The work life balance has improved but it has a ways to go. Management is hit or miss. Options to move up are limited.
good,"Wells Fargo in sterling seems to have made some progress in the past couple years since I left. They seem to be for the better. If I absolutely, desperately, needed a job, I may consider going back to the company."
good,When i started this was a great place after 2008 it change for the worse.  Lots of micro management.  The people were great to work with.  Seem to move up you had to join a clique.
good,Depends on your department and management between happiness and misery. Very different between bank and brokerage . Overall lack of communication and listening from the higher ups led to their current issues.
good,"Advancement is not for ALL - only for those who are 'politically correct' or who have an 'approved political perspective'. As a result, the work environment is highly charged and stressful.  Management actually stifles 'progress' and advancement in a self-motivated individual."
good,"When  you 1st begin they sell you a dream of this amazing job then after a few weeks of training and being on the floor you find yourself miserable with the hours, schedule, and dealing with the customers. It doesn’t matter how kind or polite you are customers still treat you like dirt and managers expect you to deal with it under ridiculous circumstances. Upper management want you to “take responsibility & ownership” of the company’s mistakes that cause serious issues for customers who can’t do anything about it because of deceitful paperwork they signed when they first began banking with WF. It’s truly a toxic environment. I commend those who truly enjoy working at WF in the phone bank because it is extremely psychologically/emotionally draining. WF should do more to push mental health awareness aside from sending out an article once every few months. Also, there is a newer position which combined two old positions. Consumer & online banking. There was not enough time allotted for employees from each department to learn the new information needed and a lot of employees were put out on the floor with little & unclear information & expected to research a huge online library for answers to customers questions all while being precise and accurate in procedure and keeping call times under a specific metric and providing the best service possible. Sounds like a set up for failure."
good,"Good company to work for. Good work life balance. Management is ok but could encourage employees with better bonus, career growth, cut down on meetings and focus on actual work"
good,"If the manager's favorites broke rules, it wasn't even mentioned even though everyone knew they had.  On the other hand, they would make up infractions for those they didn't care for.  Petty things like talking too much or going to go get coffee too often."
good,Worked here for five years. Advancement is easy if you can grow the business. It pays to network with the higher ups in the market and to attend company parties.
good,The phones are very demanding with hard to get time off and leadership always taking time off. There escalation Skype system is horrible should look into updating process.
good,"Although working here was not as stressful as other jobs, the management was not the best. They did not seem genuinely concerned about their employees needs."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of liaison work between different business lines.l "
good,"Do not recommend this company.  Too much micro management, no room for advancement. Managers were not competent. Company culture was bellow standards."
good,"Not as advanced in key areas as the competition, lacking in structure and process.  Believe they are now on track to turn things around but it is going to take a significant change in leadership to change the culture."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Working for WF was okay. The pay and benefits are good. However the management are either incompetent or unethical. Too many leaders that don't understand the business or work. Management at this company needs to be removed and replaced with more competent leaders. The workload was very high and favoritism was rampant in the company. Overall lack of trust in management since all the scandals broke from most team members.
good,"I worked as a teller for the company for 4 years prior to working in collections. As a teller you are told to almost have bubbles coming out of your butt as far as customer service is concerned. No problem. That culture should be the same across the board. As a collector I was actually told to be mean and that I was too nice so I should consider changing my personality. I refused. Customer service is my strongest skill because I believe that everyone deserves to be talked to with respect. "
good,Overall a very large company with layers of management levels and different cultures across different groups. The scandals in the past years have certainly not been helpful to employees.
good,Working at Wells Fargo has given me the ability to learn more and grow in the financial industry. I've learned how to find solutions for customers and provide the best customer experience ever.
good,No opportunity to advance or move within. They are all a solo mentality that is micro management to the max. Could definitely be worse but not my kind of company I want to give 20+ years of my life.
good,"There is a time limit on calls in the call center, listen to the customer and note the file. Handle the request in a timely manner AND sell a product and ask for a survey. Not possible without rushing or interrupting the customer. Escalated calls went to team leads then managers. Management is all about what you did and what you could have done better. Management needs to pick up their phone when a call is escalated to them. My supervisor always let his go to voicemail and never called the customer back. Team meetings were team building, rewards for handle time, high scores on quality and customer surveys and sales."
good,"Stressful environment and managers continue to change what they say at least once every other week. They put customers first before the employees. Meaning if employees follow procedures then they change on the spot to accommodate customer and reprimand the employee by creating a ""coaching"" opportunity. They also promote based on favoritism not on merit or experience. It is completely biased."
good,Though it gone through some changes the leadership team at Wells Fargo in the Bay Area was unqualified. They build and created a culture that promoted and encouraged unethical sales practices which impacted our customers and communities.
good,Wells Fargo Does not treat the employees respectfully when it comes to personal leave or family leave. As long as you are a favorite of management and don't give an opinion youre good.
good,I was hired as the Service Manager but only a few months into my role my branch manager quit. I was then the acting branch manager for a little over a year. I was never compensated for the multi roles i was forced to take on.
good,"Working in the call center environment, it is an extremely fast paced day, where on average, each representative will handle about 110-120 inbound calls. Now, yes Wells Fargo takes great pride in caring for their customers and their financial success while meeting their needs, however, it comes at the cost of tremendous pressure placed on the employees to meet performance goals, quotas, corporate criteria that never seems to be enough, no matter what, the goal post is moved constantly, putting more and more pressure on the employee to meet their performance goals and retain their position in the company.  Many department leaders have never performed the duties that they supervise, yet evaluate the employees performing those duties.  Supervisors spend a significant amount of their day in meetings, conferences, or in a ""do not disturb"" status, off and away from the floor.  When it comes down to the bottom line, Wells Fargo is driven by numbers, and meeting statistics, without truly considering the effect and stress placed on their employees.  You are expected to perform at the same rate and speed, or increased rates and speed, regardless of age, when even the US Labor Board recognizes that people naturally slow down in processing (mentally, and physically) as they age, however, Wells Fargo does not."
good,"very large office feels impersonal and slow to change at times. definitely pressure to sell, and to advise their way. rules change daily as do expectations frequently feels like the goal is moving"
good,"Wells Fargo has not learned from their mistakes. This company is unethical. My schedule was constantly changed. I was always called in to cover other co-workers shifts. People were constantly quitting due to the lack of inflexibility of management. There is no work life balance unless you take the PTO.  If you work part time you will be scheduled for 6 hr shifts exactly so they don't have to give you a lunch break all through out the week. You're not selling things anymore, but you are constantly harassed about pushing products to people that don't need it. The major benefits is the PTO and the health benefits are decent if you don't have health care."
good,The group within which I work is an okay environment.  We're expected to take on a high level of responsibility for issue resolution but not necessarily encouraged to think freely...
good,Back when I first started it was ok but things have been getting more and more chaotic.  Also we are forced to do tasks that should be for other jobs like PM's BA's etc.   It seems like only about 1% of my time  is spent programming.
good,It was a nice place to work but what I did not like about the job was that I was not payed very well. I didn’t really know my pay was going to be as low as it was.
good,good pay. stressful and inconsistent management that can lead to numerous issues within company and team members causing a downfall in production and on the floor.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"No advancement, poor salary, sad benefits, horrible management. No room to grow within the company. Upper management thinks of you as a number and not a human being."
good,There is no me time or time to meet your coworkers. Its taking calls every second of everyday. yes I understand its a call center however I am used to being about to meet my coworkers ands relate to them
good,thought this would be a company I could retire from however not the case. A lot of micro management going on and everyday wells changes the guidelines for underwriting.
good,I believe Wells Fargo is an excellent place to begin a banking career however not for a lifetime. The workplace is at times uncomfortable because of the culture at Wells Fargo.
good,you had to be very on point with what you are doing and rather self learn or else you can be annoying management too much. but vacation time is really good if you are working your standard hours
good,"Short stint as a lockbox programmer, assisted check keyers in improving speed and accuracy of data entry. Workload drastically changed as I was brought on full time."
good,"- Most of the day in my job was tick remediation"
good,easy to learn the full scope of how your department works as all departments are open to shadowing opportunities. i learned much about underwriting and closing
good,In my experience I found that the company was more concerned about upselling products and pulling more funds from their consumers. Accounts were being opened by management and some store clerks to avoid being fired because we had a limit on how many product offers must be sold within that month to keep your job. The turn around rate was high for the location. I could and never will work for a company like this
good,"If you want to make your money how they want it, you are constantly being reviewed every 30mins pressuring you into making their sale goals. 5 a day to keep the manager away, as they say. It's stressful, I originally wanted to work part-time but that wasn't an option for me."
good,Not much support or training. Management issues and a lot of change. Depends on region on what the rules and policies are.  Culture is a work in progress.
good,I was recruited to work at Wells but was laid off along with about 70 other people due to lack of volume due to rising interest rates. Wells Fargo treated me fairly but i left a long term job to go there and was laid off a short time later.
good,"The company had unrealistic sales and bonus goals that promotes unethical behavior from employees. The company overall was not bad, but the pressure put on employees to achieve goals was unethical."
good,"I was not okay with sitting in the same cubicle day in and day out.  I needed more variety and challenge to my work.  It seemed hard to advance from the position I was in."
good,Good company overall culture change created challenges but overall great experience.  Great benefits for team members most challenging part of job surviving the culture changes.
good,I do not wish to write a review on WFB. Worked 8 to 10 hours per day depending on what was happening that day. Management did not work the same hours as Supervisors.
good,"I loved my job at Wells in the beginning after about 3 years I received a 5 on my review which had to go through two levels of management to approve.   I was then moved to another department underwriting for loss mit.  The management was horrible, there was no moving up on emails from manager to manager on who was next to leave ( i did see the emails personally) Management and teams would change often and if your manager did not care for you it showed and you were moved to another team or department."
good,"It was a nice place to work; but I believe the staff could have made the job more relaxing."
good,"Desk job with most of my typical day spent at the computer. Very few team activities/meetings/announcements etc although this is my experience with only one manager. It doesn't even feel like I work with a team, as our manager encourages very little team building and the nature of the work itself is very independent and most communication done via phone, IM, or email. There are some great people working here and some not so great ones like any company. The company doesn't offer many benefits aside from the basic healthcare, retirement, etc which is disappointing for a fortune 500 company. It would be nice to have free parking, gym classes, and other services that I know are offered with other large companies. Job security is a little shaky for some lines of work as WF is opening up a lot of offices overseas and adding more and more jobs there. Something to ask about if you are interviewing for positions here with little if any customer contact where much of the work is done online."
good,"Not the best environment for growth and development, sales driven and not taking the time for their employees."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"It is a job.  You will not be able to plan vacations even months in advance because it has to be approved based on demand.  You are there to work and as long as you work and do your job that is all you have to look forward too. No parties, no events, no excitement, just work and what you need to change every other week due to a new rule or adjustment. You are suppose to create the claim, work the claim and document all the notes and send letters and get off the phone under 11 minutes.  If you don't meet all of your stats you will be wrote up and fired. This is not an enjoyable job. It is a job and because most people don't stay long, they offer overtime a lot."
good,A typical day in my specific position was very monotonous and thankless.  I took complaint calls for 4 hours each day and coached/trained employees for the other 4.  I learned a great deal about Fraud Detection methods.  The management structure is unapproachable and uncaring.  Other positions may have a better experience with the company but not for a Customer Service Rep.
good,"That's all I really have to say about it, to be honest."
good,I got a job with Wells Fargo when I was pregnant. Went through training and was upscaled almost right away. When accepting the upscale the management told the class it would be easier to get schedule changes. A shift bid comes out every month. Since I’ve worked there for almost a year I have not gotten a shift change. With a new baby and daycare I cannot work till 8 at night. And upon taking the upscale was hoping for a new shift but nothing has been rewarded
good,There are too many metrics to touch and management is not helpful. Customers don't want or need many of the products that management wants you to up sell.
good,"I enjoyed the culture as far as my team and some managers, to be fair it depends on the manager that you get. I had to pleasure of working with two great managers at my first branch, unfortunately some people aren't meant to be leaders and lack those qualities. The pay could be much more competitive for the type of work that you do."
good,"Wells Fargo need to work on company culture. Eliminate cronyism, allow team member to opportunities for advancement base on their knowledge of the work and not the people they know or who they are related to."
good,"Just like everyone else, labor is cut to the bone at the expense of customer service. Dual control for everything is not always possible therefor opening up employees to policy violations."
good,"Wells Fargo is in the middle of a culture crisis.  There is a significant gap in the HR department, they do not have the leaders needed to influence the business, nor do they have the internal processes to make a positive impact."
good,Only focused on hitting numbers no matter what. Customer service no longer primary focus. Focus was driving numbers to push bonuses as high as possible.
good,just not my desired career. i went to school for teaching and needed a job right after traveling so i applied for a teller position. I did move up which was nice.
good,"Great launching pad to my career, opportunity is there for advancement if you put in the hard work. "
good,"There are up's and downs to working for Wells Fargo. They offer good benefits, the pay was decent, and the vacation days were pretty good.I didn't like the fact that they more than often micromanage you."
good,Working with this company has been one of the most stressful jobs I have ever had. I'm sure it is not the same for everyone at every branch but my specific branch the management was very inconsistent and unreliable. The environment was very excepting but there was lack of boundaries
good,"It's a job I'm thankful to have but unless you're liked by management,no growth. Low morale stressful environment ,want better for myself and my family. Can't see myself growing with company.  Management really needs to be changed,  wrong ppl in management on 3rd shift . Don't like it but I still try my best to do a good job every night. Like the job itself"
good,This is production position with many deadlines! You have to stop whatever you are doing to help met the deadlines. It does not matter how many people call out or are on vacation whatever mail received has to e processed thatday!
good,Assisted customers with loans or lines of credit from beginning to end in to obtain the equity out of their properties................................
good,"The workplace culture at my position was very competitive, with unrealistic expectations, that forced my co-workers to ""cheat"" to meet the required expectations. A typical day at work was high stress, with management continually pushing unreasonable goals.  This managerial style worked from the top down, causing extremely high employee turnover."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Your ability to advance and the enjoyment of your day to day depends largely on your manager. They hold a lot of power and HR is trained to look at situations in a way that benefits management. If you have a manager that truly values your contributions and wants to see you advance...you are golden. If not...good luck.
good,"Wells Fargo can be a good place to work if you fall under the right management. However, if you don't it is hard to grow and you can become stagnant and taken advantage of work wise. Many higher paid people end up not doing much work while other bottom level people get stuck doing all the work and not being fairly compensated."
good,Find that there are some talented people but poor Work life balances.  Great projects but no appreciation for paying contractors OT for the demand somethings put on them to deliver but for fear of proofing selfs work extra hours with no pay.
good,Management is not held accountable for creating a stressful and hostile work environment. Benefits have been cut over the years but there are still some great benefits offered.
good,Bad manager = bad experience
good,"Wells Fargo has many benefits but little opportunity for advancement."
good,"Management does not stand behind the emoloyees. Does not keep their promises and very difficult to reach."
good,"Management needs work, extremely stressful, no growth opportunities, not a great job culture, not enough compensation for doing multiple department jobs"
good,"Great job for first time getting job in retail or as an intern out off college."
good,"At Wells Fargo, you needed to be included with a certain ""click"" to advance.  It never mattered about experience or people skills which was really sad because I always thought that Wells Fargo would treat all fair, but that wasn't the case at this location."
good,"Answered high volume of inbound phone calls from mostly angry customers.  You were required to sell a product or service on every phone call and your numbers directly affected your job.  If you didn't meet them, you were let go.  The people I worked with were the best part of the job."
good,"Initially starting it was nice - The branch i worked at - The manager was really nice, and cared about his employees."
good,Not the best environment to work in. People often came and went. People were rude and the management pressured you to make sales. I enjoyed the customers.
good,"Typically there would be a team of 4-8 with a supervisor. The supervisor would have only a very general idea of the job duties of each team member and could not contribute in any way other than managing. That model perpetuated up the ladder so that the higher up the process got the less one knew about it. Problems become difficult to resolve due to communication barriers regarding subject matter. Over and over again I saw technicians trying to explain an issue only to hear management conclude ""just get it done"" and then take any credit for a solution."
good,"I would not recommend working for this company. they promise you everything and don't deliver on anything. Bait you with career advancement opportunities, but whatever you do is never enough. Upper management has no clue what they are doing and only regurgitate corporate lingo without actually knowing what they are talking about."
good,"Totally sales driven. You were as good as your last good day of production/sales. The managers coached you about how to get better ,but really it was used against you later to get rid of you."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"very stressful in collections and a lot of changes to keep up with. Seems like it never really gets Better. Wanting more, and very hard to move up. Pay not enough for the drive"
good,Learned to always question what people tell you here. I was let go because a manager had me open an account for a client with an expired ID. Later they said they had no idea even though others heard him say.
good,"Poor management, lack of compassion and understanding of family emergencies, etc. Selfish company, difficult to advance, retaliation for reporting injustices to hr"
good,Wells Fargo has outstanding benefit package for team members.  This is the one thing that kept me at Wells  Fargo for so long.  Team members are able to received benefits as soon as 45 days after they begin which is great
good,"very stressful, not enough advancement and if you do get an interview, most likely you will be declined because the management staff has their favorites"
good,WFHM equips their employees with great sales tools but does not compensate fairly for production.  Onboarding and career advancement are severely lacking and there is a real struggle to find and keep capable management candidates.
good,"We are not allow to discuss Wells Fargo with outsiders. A typical day at work, is coming to work doing your job and learning new things. to help others and myself. We are a well diversity company with many cultures. the hardest part of the job is when you have others in your business. I enjoy my coworkers, spending time with them at lunch to discuss new ideal and plans."
good,"The company has struggled to navigate through this modern era of banking. There are many talented individuals working for the company, however, many of these individuals aren't given enough influence.  Current leadership can be immature and confused about the direction of the company."
good,"A typical work day at Wells Fargo relatively slow, at least to my liking. I learned first hand as to why the company has lots of fake accounts, but I did learn to how check application for lines of credits work."
good,I think that they are ok company so far. Let see what happens after project is over and how they handle end of job. If they put me on other job or just let me go.
good,"if you want to succeed financially and grow New York "
good,"The work started out interesting but quickly became tedious, repetitive and boring. Being a bank, attention to process minutia is required, and the ability to apply creativity is hampered by the need to conform to existing processes that support auditing most of the time. It's a very culturally and geographically diverse operation, and you rarely, if ever, meet most of the people you work face-to-face. The culture is the most ""stuffy"" of any I've ever worked in, although there are rare occasions where social events loosen things up a little."
good,"I like working here, but it is very stressful and when I have a problem or concern it gets swept under the rug and I only get told what they think I want to hear, not something to solve or help."
good,The company is a good company. I worked at a branch that showed favoritism and it made it hard to work. No room for advancement at the branch I was employed at.
good,"This is a good place to get your banking career on its feet, however you must have the right managers for career advancement, if you have a good management team you will go far!"
good,management was poor was always being put down; other wise I really enjoyed my job.  Easy to learn the system; employees were great to work with; my supervisor was not a great leader
good,"I did what i was asked and got through my day,communication is a key to a good flowing work place. I would recommend some one to work there that can deal with daily change at a moments notice."
good,"I have worked for this company for many years and have been through a lot of change. I have adopted the changes as they came, but upper management did not. It was always about what will you do tomorrow, today didn't count and if the upper management doesn't like you, they find a way, even making things up to get you fired. So sad to see this year after year."
good,"I love my job don't want to leave the position but I am looking for a career to be long term, and don't have to worry about being laid off. I would love to be a process again."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. Wells Fargo has some of the most talented individuals working for them, too bad they fail to recognize it.  Over all it was an okay company to work for, there's a lot to learn from your peers."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Very streesfull job ever. don't wanna work in the type of environement"
good,"You are completely not included in any of the company activities. Excluded from all team emails. Utilized to only fill a void, but never taken as a team member."
good,"no direction or feedback from management in this position.  Very redundant tasks, tight timelines without much reward.  Work primarily as individual without much team interaction."
good,"Working hours/days are not family friendly. This makes it hard to find a work/life balance. Employee development is not self paced, it's based on senority, which at times is discouraging when you want to move within the company."
good,"Not a place that I would work again. The pay was good but you are completely disposable to management. I was in a group that had employee's there for 33, 18, 15 and 12 year's and we were all displaced to make the numbers look good. I will never work for them or any company like them again. Completely destroys  your self confidence and self worth. Onward and upward to bigger and better things in my life!!!"
good,While working for Wellsfargo I noticed that there was little to no job progression. I was a top collector for a year but when asked to move hours around to go back to school or transfer to another dept. to learn more products I was turned down.
good,"I was a roving teller, I had a car wreck on job. I was forced to come back to work after only 4 of the 6 weeks I was supposed to stay out. They fired me when I was unable to hold my head up due to my neck and back injuries from the car accident. I do not think this should have happened. I should have been able to stay at home to get better the full amount of time requested by my doctors."
good,"Minimal raises that do not cover inflation. Most people take the risk and quit, and come back, hopefully at 10-15% above their pay. Lateral transfers are a joke and they never give one the advertised mid salary. Finally, PTO and holidays were increased to bring the company up to par with other banks. A very cheap institution that doesn't know how to keep employees."
good,"My employment with Wells Fargo was stressful.  I was a Wachovia employee and enjoyed my time with Wachovia.  When it switched to Wells, the entire attitude and environment changed.  I had to leave to keep my integrity."
good,Bad food bad traffic it was okay bad pay horrible management coworkers never on time bad quizzes bad equipment lack of communication the client was ok
good,I had to move my way up but there was no push with an honest heart but just numbers and sales. There were no intention of maintaining a focus of the best of the employee by one mistake it will be out.
good,working on egg shells...uncertainty of the company future with all the negative press and closures of offices and sites.  Team Members are unsure of their future and what it may hold at WF.
good,"lucky if manager likes you. "
good,"All the typical stereotypes of working in a large bank. Lower than industry pay, terrible and inconsistent management, and lack appreciation for employees."
good,Although I enjoy working with my coworker. Wells Fargo do not invest in there employees. They rate pay someone that doesn't work here more money then someone that's already employed.
good,"When you arrive at work you may or may not be greeted with a good morning or a hello it depends on how management feels. I learned a lot but that is because I was self taught. If the management does not like you, then you will not be developed. Hardest part of the job is putting up with upset customers and wondering what type of mood the managers will be in. I once said good morning to a manager and was told WHAT IS SO GOOD ABOUT IT!?"
good,People were not important. Management was not involved in the day to day process and had no knowledge of what was going on. Workflow was unorganized and not consistent.
good,"good company except management, the right hand doesn't know  "
good,"Wells Fargo does not pay you enough for the job you do. Benefits are good, but can be better. If the salary was better I would not be looking for another job."
good,Its a politics game with advancement. IF you kiss the right behind you will move up no matter what you do or don't know. Otherwise you will be stuck even if you have all the experience and knowledge. Don't suck up and you wont move up.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Teller at a large branch and also a in-store (the size of closet) I asked for more hours however they were not available which forced me to leave. Great job to have as a student- decent starting wages
good,"Worked for Wells Fargo three times.  Employer has a history of opening whole loan departments, then within 60mos closing complete loan/funding departments and layoff.  No chance to advance in employment status."
good,Working in Operations is unlike any position at the bank. If you have kids think twice before applying as it is a until finish position. You never know what time you will get off work. Slow about giving raises!
good,I have learned a lot being with this company and there are many pros and cons but cons definitely out weigh the pros. the hardest part of the job is being told your opinion matters and if you have any ideas make them known and when they are stated its more so like talking to a wall - only one person can make a decision for the ENTIRE branch on both teller and platform side even if people have brought out specific reasons as to way that isn't the best decision. Its a slow paced environment. Hardest part of the job is working with management that continues to hold you back - not excel to be the best at your position.
good,All in all a good job. Very competitive.  Wells competes on some levels with other  companies but poorly against others.  Its very much a call center environment and going more that way.
good,"The job is okay, however it is just like being in high school.  If you did not know the right people it is hard to advance.  They do have free parking which is nice downtown,"
good,"It is an all around good company to work for, but can use some work on its work life balance. The Job can be extremely stressfull with very little a times support from management."
good,"wells fargo is a good company but the benefits are lacking, and he advancement opportunities are slim.  The pay isn't great either, especially given the high nigh unreachable standards for their employees"
good,I worked the 12am-11am shift and there were times where literally zero out of 50 callers qualified for an ATM card let alone a credit card or a loan. Management does not care and most have no experience doing this job so they cannot empathize with you at all. Chances of advancement are less than one percent if you plan on having a personal life outside of work.
good,there needs to be more awareness of floor moral.  It is very low.  management does not seem as involved as they have been in the past.  compensation is extremely lower than other financial intuitions for the same positions.
good,Co workers were pleasant. The work environment was very competitive to the point of being offensive to customers in an effort to sell products.  Limited growth opportunities. Ideal for young college graduates looking for a respected industry to launch a career.
good,"Very difficult place to work.  No work/life balance.  Worked 60-70 hours a week and continued to want more.  "
good,Constant changes by corporate. Lack of structure when it comes to performance management. Mixed messaging from high level leadership. Low pay for the job duties expected.
good,"I was a part of Wells Fargo Financial, which was shut down in 2010, which was basically a cold calling center. Terrible place to work, but this is not a reflection on Well Fargo."
good,A lot of micro managing at most levels. Long hours and monotonous tasks. Coworkers were friendly and easy to get along with. Relatively low pay for a company of this size
good,they pushed sales too much you would have to stay after work to do sales calls. The credits were not anywhere where they needed  for the products and sale goals were very high
good,I first started working for First Union bank which later merged with Wachovia Bank. I enjoyed working with my customers but there are a lot of politics. The work for the most part is not difficult. Managers will vary by location and the majority are very nice.
good,"We were all inspired at one time by the ""One Wells Fargo"" model.I have come to find out each department and or division is different form the next and with no desire to unify. Don't get me wrong, I love what I do and have been able to accomplish; however, the lack of consistency throughout causes confusion and other issues. In the right department, Wells Fargo is an awesome place to work. I do not regret it for a second."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,my current position has horrible hours and work holidays.  I was lied to about the position and the possible large bonuses that i'm not getting.  always was told I can work from home and that is only after a year.
good,Working at the Branch was fun and fast paced. Every moment there was a different challenge when dealing with clients and their financial needs. The hardest part of the job was relaying unrealistic goals and direction distributed by senior level management to my employees and getting the buy in. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing someone succeed and then get promoted based on high ethical performance. The Senior Management at Wells was completely out of touch with their client base.
good,Awesome company to work for until top management changed 4 times in two years. Work philosophy changed and quality issues started to not be as much of a concern in comparison to production.
good,"I maintain strong numbers and work ethic but continue to get overlooked for opportunities; simply because I don't brownnose or rub elbows with a particular crowd. "
good,I worked as a processor. Environment was good and but no work/ life balance. Management team was ok; always focusing on delivering the bottom line and ensuring team work was fail and efficient.
good,I started off Wells in California. It was a great team environment and I really enjoyed coming to work each day. I transferred to Utah with Wells and it was a totally different company. The branches in Utah were not looking out for the best interest of their customers.
good,This was a good experience to help develop my skills in quality control and as a subject matter expert. The downside was the location was too far and the commute time was very long.
good,"It's and OK place to work "
good,As a contract employee they let your agency know that you need to go after you leave for the day.  No notice. No discussion. You then have to wait for for your possessions until your agency can pick them up and then arrange to get them.
good,"You can gain basic experience about financial products. However, I felt that management invested little time and effort into existing employees. Wells Fargo can feel like a revolving door in some deptartments."
good,"they interviewed me & declined me even tho I have experience, & they give people anxiety just because of their pressure tactics & numbers they look at"
good,"Bankers only care about there numbers and not what best fits the customers needs. Cross-sell is the only thing that they care about as a company and not customer service. Multiple laws suits have been filed due to illegal sales practices. This company can be great with the right management and attitude towards doing what's right for the customer. I always ran my business the right way and truly positioning benefits of our products and services. However if there was no products being sold, upper management will call you ineffective and not good at your job. This company doesn't value there employees or there customer. You are nothing but a number."
good,"VERY goal driven, you are required to hit such high marks that they are sometimes Unachievable Ana left you feeling helpless"
good,"Wells Fargo was a ok company to work for they take care of there employees and gave me great benefits the downfalls they have are in the district i was in if you where not popular you did not move up. in the 3 years i worked there i applied for 18 different positions to try an advance and never got moved up.they do not  care that you have a life outside of work, they make you feel guilty when your kiddos are sick. but they are quick to fire people unless you fit into the click then they will make sure you keep your job"
good,"If you don't wanna learn anything from Technical side, then go there and settle. Management is not good. Prepare yourself for micro management and cheap politics inside Team."
good,"I worked in the branch for a short period as a Personal Banker II. The culture there was one of product pushing as seen in the lawsuit that Wells was hit with in 2016. It was a difficult environment to work in unless you were willing to compromise your principles. I wasn't willing to do that, so I moved on."
good,"fun environment, learn alot about the financial side of businesses however schedules are made at random. no set availability and required to be available every day of the week."
good,"Upper management is able to do as they please, as long as they produce. In my area, out of 11 branches we lost 5 managers-4 of which were seasoned(5+ yrs management) and 3 actively looking to leave. Our feedback scores for my area hit a low like I had never seen in 10 yrs, however no changes happened. I chose to no longer be subject to the culture of that environment, months later, all was exposed"
good,The company itself is a great company to work for. The culture of the branch you are located at will make a huge difference on whether you enjoy your job or not. One of the issues I had was the biases and preferential treatment some of the employees received based on friendships and not the job performance.
good,"mailroom clerk for a financial institution, a typical day includes gathering mailbags, sorting mail, delivering mail to internal customers, inputting deliveries into a database."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Very little comes back to the employees, the company is more interested in the bottom line. The office environment lacks vibrancy and can be demotivating. Very backward thinking, no team culture."
good,A typical work day at Wells Fargo would consist of reviewing emails and completing daily task for customer aplications. I  enjoyed working with and getting customers the assistance availible to them based off the investor guidelines. I enjoyed working with the employees in my group.
good,"Worked as a contractor for Wells Fargo home mortgage department. Work place was hard to work in with the cubicle   setting, work was inconsistent due to field. I was transferred to different department due to lack of work in refinances."
good,"If you are interested in a career in banking, starting as a teller is a great choice. Most of the management started out as a teller."
good,"Have to meet expectation of company goals that includes sales and calls per day. Advance in promotions very competitive is good to know someone in the hiring table. Managers seem repetitive with what they call coaching but what it is if you don't meet your quotes for the week they pull you aside and tell you what you do wrong and why didn't you extended customer service or why didn't you sell them a products. The Phone bank revolves around sales and how much more you can push for next month, customer service is what the company says its first but you can give great customer service and still not get sales you'll be in the red and thats not good."
good,A sales structure and incentives affected the sales culture of the company and as a result damaged customers financial health. It was difficult to get promotion  if you do things right.
good,"They pay very well, have great benefits but horrible work environment. The manager was not good with sticking to 1 on 1s and advising us of where we were doing good and where we could improve."
good,"A typical day includes helping customers with service issues. Running a cash box, and lobby leadership. The most enjoyable part of this job was how I got to help others."
good,Have worked in great areas with great management.  Other areas had severe issues from the top down.  After 9 years was still unable to break glass ceiling.
good,"I worked in a fast paced environment where time management was a must. My co-workers were great and we worked together as a team. The hardest part was leaving a great team when our jobs was forwarded to Charlotte, NC. The most enjoyable part was coming to work and getting the job done regardless of the time constraints."
good,"The training program was quite extensive and involved a lot of irrelevant information. What we didn't learn or would need help with our managers were to assist us, though the manager didn't know the position as it was constantly changing and he wasn't educating himself on the process. Manager was hard to get a hold of, even though he worked five desks down from my desk. He preferred to have a senior member of the team help out those in training, though all of the senior team members were already doing the work of two to three people. The co-workers were great though and from what I could tell everyone wanted everyone to do well."
good,"No chance of advancement or getting paid a living wage, $3.00 raise in pay after 6 years. Co-workers who constantly screw up and make the team look bad, incompetent and foolish are not fired."
good,"Committed to diversity and team environment. Difficult to grow business under current plan.  Managers ask for feedback, but  little action taken."
good,"Wells Fargo is a wonderful place to learn the inner workings of a big bank.  Depending on your position, the hours can be long and certainly worth the effort."
good,"Many sales goals with this position. Although you are compensated for them, they are also required. This puts a lot of pressure on upper management which in turn puts a lot of pressure of bankers. If you are great with sales and like high pressure jobs then this is a great company for you."
good,"Help people succeed financially. I learned the intricacies of the banking world from federal regulations to financial advisory. Management was typical call center, metric driven motives.This was a bit disturbing considering we are dealing with peoples money and financial well being,"
good,"Repetitiveness, crowded break rooms, not many opportunities for advancement."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I worked for Wells Fargo for almost four years and although I didn't want to move up in the company, i can say that they do promote very quickly. Though at my branch we had more tellers and management leave or get fired than people getting promoted. Its a matter of where and with whom you are working with. I'll miss my customers but not so much my coworkers."
good,"With that being said the specific locations is under staffed, under managed, and led by terrible example. But the job security and benefits make it all worth while. I just continue to keep my head down in hope for a better outcome when I look up again."
good,Many promotions and management always changing. No consistency and micromanagement is a little out of hand. Base salary higher than other banks but has low incentive pay.
good,"Vision is good, but execution could use some work.  They are good with benefits and training, but need some work on hiring more people to keep up with the turn over.  Home/life needs serious work.  People don't have time to be with their families.  Pay isn't that great either."
good,"This a a great company but not to work for, very stressful. Sales goals are aggressive and District Managers are all about them and making their bonus checks at the end of the quarter. They have a famous phrase ""We care about you"""
good,Your growth is dependent on your department and management. As long as you come prepared to work and you'll do fine. Training is normally side by side rather than classroom.
good,"Co-workers are like family. Benefits are good. Not much advancements opportunities. Typical day at work includes taking inbound/outbound calls in call center. Management are unavailable a lot of the times, takes many request to get the proper materials to do work. All managers are not on same page, information given is not consistent."
good,"This job requires attention to detail. Every transaction you do matters because it affects your job. You meet all sorts of people and not only you process their transaction but also sell them the products and services. The job is heavily sales oriented and if you meet or exceed your sales goal every quarter, there is a bonus."
good,Can be a good place to get experience. Overall not conducive to healthly life work balance. Can be toxic at times. Overall like most companies in the US.
good,Too many changes within a matter of 2 years. Promotes those who lack experience and knowledge and oversee those who are better in qualifications.
good,"It is a bank, so it is very sales oriented. It is all about numbers, nothing else as a company. If you are lucky and get to work in a good branch with a cool boss and coworkers is one thing, but the company overall, they just care about numbers."
good,"worked a while at this company. I enjoyed the work and most of the co-workers. "
good,"I have held the same position for two years and have hit my numbers each quarter. I have built relationships with customers, who specifically ask for me to process their transactions. I was promised multiple promotions, but was never given the promotion. I feel a undervalued for the service I give and the compensation I'm paid."
good,"Good Company to work, but management are greedy so if your a great hard working employee and are exceeding all sales goals management will not allow you to promote so they won't lose their bonuses."
good,"Wells Fargo like most major corporations has good and bad things. The good things are it's people. Most are hard-working, customer centric individuals who try to do the best at their job and seek to satisfy the needs of the customer, bother internal and external."
good,"The branch I worked in had a reputation for horrible management, high turnover, and overall customer dissatisfaction. The lack of consistent competent management coupled with the continuous short staffing made for stressful and hectic days. The constant pressure to push more and more products upon customers was not pleasant."
good,"great compensation but with ridiculous sales goals"
good,"I have worked for this Company on and off for over 20 years. In more recent years, they have been concerned about the bottom line then if employees actually have a work/life balance."
good,"Working with customers everyday and interacting with them was the benefit of this position.  Having to push to meet sales every month was not.  Personally, I don't feel it is fair to push for someone to open up a credit card they do not need just because the teller has to be reach a certain amount of sales each month.  Doing business that way is not putting the customer first."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"When you have a supportive management team the job is great, but when the management is not there then the job can become a revolving door. The great management we had in place, at first, made the work environment very welcoming. On the downside of things, when management changed, tenure employees and their efforts to stay loyal with the company went unnoticed. Overall, one specific region seemed to not care about the employees they were losing to competitors and treated tenured employees as easily replaceable regardless of management being under investigation for certain reasons. My co-workers were like family. The hardest part of my job was seeing tenured employees leave to go work for competitors. They did not feel valued and neither did I when I left."
good,its the kind of job where youre lucky you dont kill yourself by the end.  you are a personal punching bag for all the inconsiderate customer who bank with WF.  The management knows the job is horrible - so they are actually phenomenal and are constantly doing their best to be your personal cheerleader and keep it as positive as possible.  I wouldnt recommend being a phone banker to my worst enemy
good,Very demanding as compared to previous Wachovia. Many changes in management. Outside work entertainment was eliminated. Bonus incentive program from employee to employee eliminated. Recovery time to catch up on work changes after a significant absence was reduced significantly.
good,"None of the upper management was on the same page. Always told to do one task 4 different ways. However, I enjoyed interacting with our customers and my co-workers."
good,When first starting out at Wells Fargo you get four weeks of PTO which is nice. Great learning experience if starting out in the work force.
good,A typical day at WF requires you get permission from you manager to do anything whenever you sit down with a customer. You have to step away from your client to let management know what you are doing with each customer. You are required to have so many solutions and not get compensated for some of them.
good,"Working with the company was pretty good at first. After a while you start to notice certain things about sales goals and compensation that really lead to a difficult culture to work in. A company that emphasizes customer service and meeting customer needs, but doesn't tailor goals and thresholds to meet the various markets and demographics in which branches are located. You need to have an iron will to not try and bend the rules to make incentive, as the goals are seemingly low, until you realize its a lot more difficult than you think to show that you are competent and able to be a personal banker while meeting the customer needs for your area, most of which don't involve additional services or sales at all."
good,Management is in a disarray. High turn over rate due to miscommunication between management and its employees. coworkers aren't required to dress appropriately. The whole place was unprofessional
good,"Enormous corporate structure, difficult to navigate to find success, a popularity game through and through. The training is on point and then your thrown to the wolves. Customers are both good and bad like anywhere really. At an affluent branch I was insulted and made to feel worthless and unnecessary on a daily basis. A carrot and stick type management with a lot of stick wielding and very, very ...very small carrots. Strict policies in place that most seasoned employees know how to get around based on loopholes. Can be unscrupulous and mean-spirited at times, the word caddie comes to mind. Learned a lot about banking, financial best practices and how affective money and such can be. Coaching was like kindergarten not like business school and stickers and paper certificates are you badges for a job well done rather than education and dollars. Basically, rich people don't want to buy anything from a young poor white guy. In a sales based business that is really all that matters."
good,"Hardworking and highly motivated with a professional attitude.  Ability to establish rapport, communicate effectively with customers and competent in effectively dealing with high customer traffic and constant interruptions."
good,"60 hr weeks typical, highly professional, enjoy client interaction, reporting requirements are burdensome, good co-workers, good training"
good,A typical day at work would be to come in get on the phone until breaks or a team meeting . I learned to coop with customers and understand how to deal with them being upset. Management was horrible they only adjusted to long term employees and favorites. My coworkers was awesome they never let you fall as a team member showed you great ways to adjusting in changes was like a family. The hardest thing about the job was the schedule try to work and have a life outside of the job (doc appt. kids family planning etc.) The things i enjoyed about the job the most was being able to be in control of how I determine my pay working with new ideas on how to meet your daily or monthly goal.
good,"Good corporation to work for, but not enough support from management. Great support within the processing and underwriting department."
good,Always being pushed to reach a goal and nothing in return. Childish management that was not always around so it was hard to communicate anything. Department for compliance would not give us a heads up when a new rule would take affect and have it still count against us.
good,It was nice place to work.Daily payments for variety customer gets process. Mainly HIPPA rules followed and because of it employee has to be very careful with what they do.. Managements were very supportive with personal problem. I have learned a lot things from working there. All the co-worker was very helpful and team player. Hardest part was meeting to dead line and not be able to go home on time. Most enjoyable part of this job was having food days and little dress up parties. Yearly raise is depends on employees stats. Raises are usually percentage of employees salary
good,Great starter company if you want to break in to the corporate world of sales and competition among peers.  Adaptability is key to success.  Great resume builder!
good,"A typical work day at Wells Fargo includes problem solving skills, providing excellent customer service, there are challenges in the workplace depending on your job title/ department. Wells Fargo does provide great benefits for their employees."
good,"Unlimited overtime provided a sense of job security"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Kind of a terrible place to work. No upward mobility, poor management, un-achievable goals, pay cuts...Ok benefits, overall horrible company...."
good,Typical work day consist of uploading documents into the company database and transferring them to multiple departments
good,"Wells is a very large institution which makes it extremely challenging to make a difference, both internally and externally.  In an increasingly challenging regulatory environment, institutions like Wells have had their ability to compete in this market segment severely damaged"
good,people are very fake and you have no hope getting real experience in your career goal. Just get a real job. I don't understand how they pay good in the banks but I'd rather get a minimum wage job in an accounting office where I will gain real experience.
good,"A very hectic environment to work in on a day to day basis. Not much learning is possible after basic skill set is acquired, Management are useful in some instances but not readily available and do not have IT backgrounds so it becomes even more challenging to explain instances that arise with customers, co-workers are great helping each other through challenges, The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate stock brokers who were experiencing computer issues."
good,"	Used my banking product knowledge to expand customer relationships through consultative sales"
good,poor time management within the company as far as work/life balance was concerned. If you have no children lockbox is ideal.
good,"Bad management,  little  room  for growth, low  pay  for  amount  of  workload, and  no  job  stability. In  addition culture of  company  does  not  give  employees  motivation   to  work  hard  because  there  is  a  glass  ceiling and  pay  is  low."
good,"Typical day of unnecessary product pushing, micro managing, and calling the same customers day in day out for things they say no every time"
good,"Full Time 8:30 to 5:30 Monday to Friday, plus Saturday 8:30 to 1:30."
good,"Learned how to work directly with Mediations, Bankruptcy and Foreclosure Attorney's, Borrower's Counsel, and Judges to come to the best resolutions possible for customers facing foreclosure while in default servicing."
good,My trainer well she was lier and rude. she didnt care about anyone but herself and put the job first even when i almost lost my life on the freeway while i was on my way to work and all she could say was i dont care whats going on with you its slammed here and you need to be at your window so hurry up and get here. I wont ever work for them again. I felt so awkward and uncomfortable there. Oh and this was the stephanie and boulder branch in hendersons.
good,"Not a great place to work forever.  It is a great place to learn sales though, if you take what they teach with a grain of salt."
good,"Large stable company.  Hours varied from typical 8 hours to up to 12 a day.  There were Saturday mandatory hours required  Fast paced environment and lots of protocol and requirements to keep lending authority.  Training was required and a must.  Worked in teams with provided you with support and guidance from co-workers.  Over 5 1/2 years management seems to always be changing there for not very consistent and communication was poor at best.The enjoyable part of the job was the end result, happy satisfied customers."
good,"A typical day was great. I enjoyed working here but, I started during a firing spree and there was no manager or asst. just asking management. I liked my co-workers. I think the hardest part were jet scans as that was the counting of thousands of dollars and they use a machines that sometimes counted two bills at once."
good,Did not settle in to much as I knew it was for contract. Knew they were not taking on full time.
good,"In this position, I have been challenge with learning the ins and outs of the wealth management industry. You must take your Series 66 & 7 to be registered and execute trades on behalf of clients and their financial advisors. The downside is that there is little growth and management does not do a good job of motivating or incentivizing their staff."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The overall vibe of our work environment was always tense, everyone was always on pins and needles because management made you feel scared EVERY DAY that you will lose your job is you ""breath"" too hard.The company was a good company to work for the but the management team sucks. "
good,The work was not difficult however being laid off with no notice was surprising for such a big company.
good,"Before I was laid off, I was always stressed out but the increasing demand to sale, sale, sale! The company was moving away from providing excellent customer service to expecting a sale on every call. Because selling is not my cup of tea, I was not as satisfied at the end of my employment there."
good,"If you enjoy high pressure sales tactics and micromanagement, this is the job for you. If not, stay away. Sales is all this company cares about. Low pay and no breaks except for lunch. Sales goals are nearly impossible to achieve. High turnover."
good,"Sales goals are un realistic. Salaries are below industry average. Bonus are difficult to attain and lower than other banks. DM is horrible in terms of management/people skills. Very rude to employees comes to locations and doesn't even acknowledge staff besides branch manager. Regardless if everything is going according to her demands she would find something that she doesn't like and come back once it's the way she likes and then say its incorrect."
good,Many great people to work with. Banks have many different departments and likely there is a fit somewhere for most.
good,"I do not like the sales aspect of being a Wells Fargo teller  all banks require their employees to sale financial products but wells fargo's sales expectations are a lot higher than other banks. No matter how good of a person you are or how good your customer service is, if your sales are low you may be a lot less likely to advance in the company. They care more about sells than good customer service, if your an employee and you provide horrible customer service but still have excellent sales you could still advance in the company regardless of how bad your customer service is. Sales at wells fargo can be stressful rather your good at it or not. but if your all about selling than this may be the job for you, but banking may be a lot different from others sells. I have a history or sales experience but I did not love doing sales at wells fargo. They may care more about sells than their employees."
good,My job is always changing and keeps you on your toes.  Every day you learn something new.
good,bad management and grey lines that make you feel uncomfortable and are often rewarded for just to be yelled at later.
good,"I worked here for 2.5 years and was stressed out the whole time. Thresh-holds in order to get bonus pays are nearly impossible in certain locations which make it hard to create the correct customer perspective. On top of the fact that the bonus is nearly impossible the management is put under such stress that they turn to negative reinforcement on the employees with a, ""coach up or coach out"" method that makes you wonder form day to day if your even going to continue to be employed... I hated it. Good benefits though but after I was forced out due to a manager HR issue they told me to pay back 3000$ in tuition reimbursement which maxed out my credit card. The ultimatum was pay or they would post it as a collection account and ruin my credit."
good,"Its a very busy yet enjoyable work environment. The hours are normal,8-5pm, however during tax season management will expect you to until the days goal is met which can mean you wont get out of the office until 8pm. I liked the job a lot more once my team-lead changed. overall a pretty good company to work for."
good,"They pull you in and make you think you are doing what the customer wants, but then they just want you to shove product down the customers throat. Its all about sales."
good,"I worked under an extremely stressful  environment everyday."
good,"Wells Fargo was a decent job. Great pay and bonus structure with excellent time off. No job security, you can loose your job over the smallest detail. Management shows no interest in you personally only if you meet your sales goals will you really feel valued with the company. Asked to ambush friends and family for bank products and forced to solicit businesses in the area to open accounts. WF doesn't care if you solicited the customer yesterday and they rejected, you will still be expected to offer the customer what the system recommends for them."
good,"non stop calls "
good,"Working at Wells Fargo started out to be a very good experience. There were employees still remaining from the ""conversion"" after Wells Fargo bought out a local bank. After a few years of settling, many of the previous bank employees quit under the extreme unreasonable pressure of Wells Fargo policies. I tried my hardest to keep trying, but after being 9 months pregnant and the District Manager forcing me to work 50 hour work weeks with no lunch or personal breaks, no permission to sit down (it would look bad to customers) and the requirement of having a ""good reason"" to take a bathroom break (being on the verge of giving birth was not considered acceptable) I quit. The team members at my location were very good people and tried very hard to pull together and support each other, but management and corporate were reprehensible."
good,cash flowed loans to see if would qualify for loan modification
good,"Typical day would include preventative maintenance on equipment, submit paperwork for upcoming jobs, vendor proposals and vendor coordination for equipment replacement or work. Tenant service calls and communicating with property management."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Enjoyed working for Wells Fargo. Followed instructions and took care of what was needed of me
good,"Wells Fargo is a sales based company. Even as a part time teller you face sales goals, that sometimes seem impossible to meet. If you do not meet them, you definitely feel the pressure of possibly losing your job."
good,"taiught you great work ethics, but no room for growth or pay increase."
good,"wells fargo in Bemidji mn. demonstated poorly the standards of the wells fargo mission statement.  they demonstrated nepotism on a ongoing basis. favoritism was ridiculous. management. was focused on an outdated vision of consumer banking. the working envirement was biased and management was not consistent in following audit regulations.i witnessed cheating on closed sales.sales numbers inflated.  misdirected blame for mgt mistakes. and created hostile envirement for those employees who were not ""in favor"". and embellished write-ups with no recourse for as' said' employee, .. management discriminated based on lifestyle choice, disability status, socioeconomic grouping, race, and sex. I witnessed clearly unethical resigning of top mgt. strategical planning and collecting of customers and business accounts  when fully intending to resign their positions with wells fargo."
good,Good environment but did not really care about employees. Typical call center.
good,You will lose your soul. They will ask you to do unacceptable things to make impossible sales goals.
good,"Beware of the high turn over. Money is decent, but it is not worth the poor scheduling, work/life balance, & lack of of communication."
good,No room for advancement in Las Vegas. And pay is not to good. They offer decent healthcare at low cost
good,Had to train incoming works on the procedures. ?Daily entry of Insurance claims and billing charges for multi franchaises.
good,"Wachovia was apart of the banking mortgage crisis.... that pretty much sums it up. Wachovia is now Wells Fargo which is one of the most unethical banks I have worked for.... employees are so pressure to sell that you have things like:"
good,Hardcore sales environment where management often throws team under the bus to boost his/her chances of moving up the corporate ladder.
good,"After a few years you will burn out.   Unrealistic expectations and hard to move up in the company, if you get a chance get out as soon as possible."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was helping people achieve their goal of home ownership.  Enjoyed establishing relationships with Realtors and builders/developers.
good,"Work and business as usual. "
good,"I did not enjoy working for Wells Fargo but I like their banking products.  When my position was eliminated, they did not offer to keep me on and train me for any open positions, which there were some.  Also, there is not a good working relationship between departments and it was a yours/ours environment which was destructive to the local bank.  Some of it had to do with the personalities but it was also the corporate"
good,"Processed the applications on a daily basis.  I learned the importance of accuracy in sending out applications.  Management was involved in following up.  Co-workers had to use team effort to "
good,"Mostly working behind computer screen performing daily responsibilities as answering emails, phone calls and servicing loans in all kinds of ways."
good,"A typical work day will be co-workers talking behind each other backs, favoritism by the supervisor among employees. There is no room for fun, not even allowed to befriend co-workers and also discrimination by the supervisor."
good,The job was a good learning experience but the company's location was very far away and the group itself was not very organized. All departments ran together and there wasn't any separation.
good,The best part of the job is the customers.  Things become very different once the customers are gone.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,It is definitely a big company and they have a bad habit of treating their employees that way.
good,"sign on the phone at beginning of shift, check my calender for the day, answer calls, refer products, read library resources, meeting with managers to go over goals. I was trained for 8 weeks to perform my job. The location I am at is lacking positive communication. The coworkers are awesome! The hardest part of the job is the negativity from the customers on the phone. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping small business owners succeed financially."
good,Ethics is not always the highest priority. Sales at all costs.
good,"The only duties that I had for this job was to overlook documents on the computer. I was able to bring my cd player to work and listen to my cd's while I was working. As there was a lot of people in the building, I didn't really talk to anyone besides the supervisor there. The job was quite easy, but the hardest thing was being there so early in the morning. The best part of that job was the hot and cold lunches they had for their employees."
good,"Sr. Leaders managed via Blackberry.  All messages urgent. No work life balance.  ""The Sky is Falling"" atmosphere every day."
good,"A typical day would include preparing with all the necessary items needed for operating for the day from forms to staffing.  Doing daily audits and client form reviews.  Client service from opening accounts to helping to solve client issues.  The co-workers are wonderful team players.  The hardest part of the job would be when I would have to do a corrective action or termination with them.  The best part of the day and job was meeting new clients and making them part of my family.  I consider each of my clients to be a part of my family and wish to help them any way that I can and get to know them."
good,Management is not constantly over your shoulder if you are a good producer. Easy to balance your day without a lot of hassle.
good,"This place is like high school, every manager there is egotistic and immature. Every time I come back to Wells I pray for a better manager, but they've failed me each time. If it wasn't for the poor management, this place would be ok to work for!"
good,I did like the interactions with customer's. Consistent day of deposits/ withdrawals.I learned that counting money is tedious work as well as takes constant concentration. The hardest part was the constant stress of balancing all day. I enjoyed meeting all the new customers.
good,The people who worked there were awesome but the culture and core values leave something to be desired
good,"You can never really take time off because you have to work even when your are on vacation. They stress level is out of control, management calls several times a day to check up on you and to make sure you are selling.  That happens everyday. "
good,High intensity and fast paced position focused on client service.
good,"Wells is a great company to work for. However, in the departments with a call center there is little room for schedule flexibility as schedules are created to taylor the business need only."
good,"I enjoyed working here do to the productivity requirement, unfortunately they had no room for advancement. "
good,"The management tends to be very manipulative, and make it difficult for work/life balance. Above and beyond your job description is expected, not appreciated or rewarded. Advancement is limited because management knows who they want for a promotion or available position before they post for it, so applying for something is more or less a waste of time. "
good,"I was happy to work here, the hours were great, early morning to early afternoon. The atmosphere wasn't too appealing. Constant health issues from the high amounts of stress people were dealing with. Wasn't a fan of the poor attitudes of coworkers. "
good,"If you are looking for a work environment which is fast pace this is the ideal job. The supporting staff is great. Management is left to be desired. This was a place to grow in your career now it has become an overworked, under paid and under valued location. All Wells Fargo Dealer Services are not like the one in Kennesaw. Overall the company is great just not this location."
good,Originating loans and putting out fires trying to get loans closed.
good,Company doesn't rely on employees education and experience in making important decisions.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Great company, however certain leaders from the previous company are still involved in showing favoritism to certain employees and controversial, unethical behaviors that go ""unnoticed"" by upper leadership. Some senior leaders are involved in placing party-buddies and ""overnight sleep-over"" ""guests"" in their districts and leadership positions. Sad unfortunately - there are many other highly training, good, dedicated and loyal people who could do just as good or even better in leadership that get overlooked because upper management does not get involved in the districts activities enough. Therefore allowing this unethical behaviors to continue. I am sure it it not like this everywhere... but in Texas, it is rampant. Another interesting thing is that every person who takes a stand against certain people for this behavior - like myself - end up without a job."
good,"Very stressful, goals cannot be met in an 8 hour day. Over time is a must and then it is very difficult to keep up. Too much work for too little employees."
good,very sales driving company not customer nor employee friendly!
good,Wells Fargo is a typical work day
good,this company is the worst banking industry i have ever worked for
good,I have no ability to move out of the operations department without having to quit my job and reapply within the company. Lack of job challenge and large drop in work load
good,"It is a good company when it comes to compensation and benefits. However, it's extremely hard to move up in the company. Once you are in retail, you are kindda stuck there."
good,Some managers areexcellent. I learn a lot about Wells constant change business process but what I learn I teach myself. Lots of pressure to complete projects that are not that important and important tasks are covered over. Some coworkers are good and some are brown nose but most are just trying to keep their job
good,"Very corp. america, not balance between work and home life.."
good,Its high school with 20 something year olds. You are expected to do and know everything and yet they do not give you the correct tools and oppurtunities.
good,The position was 100% sales based and did not offer the correct customer service skills that are valued by customers.
good,"This company supported education, I started my day organizing priorities. Taking care of renewals, cancellations, endorsements, policy checking, applications, taking claims and reporting to carrier."
good,"Wells fargo in some departments was a great employer to work for, however with them being one of the lrgest employers here in the Des Moines area, they will be quick to get rid of employees for personal reasons versus having a valid work reason for termination."
good,Addressed Ira/Cap (investment checking) and Brokerage questions·Mediated between clients and financial advisors regarding investment accounts· Administered Bank/Investment products and IRS Tax laws assistance in the absence of supervisors
good,"As with most phone jobs, every minute of each day was monitored. It's a very strong method for making the department's use of time effective, but it felt as though there was no trust in employees. Granted, some functions of the department had need for the monitoring (i.e. automated dialer, recording statistics). The environment was discouraging; many people did not enjoy the job. It is difficult to work at a job which you are not particularly fond of; it is impossible to work at a job where its employees share a mutual distaste of management, duties, and culture."
good,Nightly files are given to you for the next work day.
good,I enjoyed my time with Wells Fargo. This job was very beneficial to my overall developement. I actually won top performer 3 months in a row.
good,The people I worked with were great. My immediate supervisor was also great. Upper management was unapproachable. It was frustrating to have department policies change daily. Also there were 3 different human resource departments and all would transfer you to the next if someone needed help.
good,"WFB had a lot of discrimination, not enough support from supervisor."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"this place is cut throat and everyone stabs one another in the back, nothing is ever good enough, and the management at the Manteca CA branch is AWFUL"
good,24 hours paid classroom training for licencing as Unarmed Security Officer.
good,"co workers where great, management was ok but i need fulltime benefits and employment."
good,Very easy to maintain a worklife balance with reasonable pay. Sales goals unreasonably high but attainable
good,Good place for entry level work. Can learn about various systems and departments in the bank area.
good,Unrealistic sales goals and extreme push to open family and friends account. Long hours serving customer and minimal time to follow up. Minimal time for training and self managed time. Lack of opportunity to excel and bring your skills. Micro management style. Long hours work and no time for lunch break or snack time.
good,Analyzing income documentation
good,"They say that there are two kinds of staff at Wells. It's not uncommon to see a person that has been in the same role for many, many years and has few real world skills. The second group quickly realizes that there is no option to move up in the company and therefore they move out. It is very difficult to move up internally at Wells. Part of it has to do with the lack of cross training, mentoring, and the large corporate culture. One of my coworkers retired after 25 years. About a year later she came back to work part time because she couldn't live on her retirement plan. Another coworker use to complain about the politics and lack of management support. That coworker has worked at least six other banks and couldn't believe the sort of abuse she would get on the job. Some days can feel like a reality show, everyone who survives has a strategy in place. It is not so much what you know, but who you know in management, and who will protect you. I met some good people and not so good people there. I made a few friends. Overall I learned a lot on the job and on my own. Now it's time to move on and up elsewhere."
good,"Work Work Work, the hardest part is the hours no time for personal life."
good,work with tellers to help produce sales and work with management to hit goals
good,"real estate collections: inbound/outbound calls with customers who are delinquent on their mortgage loans. Assist in long term solution by determining reason for delinquency and customer's intent. This is a fast pace and high stress environment, highly competitive and incentive paid."
good,Good people to work with. The company is only concered with fees collected not based on building relationships.
good,Too many conference calls and repetitive things causing counter productivity and poor work/life balance
good,"The particular area I worked in was overall average. The management wasnt terrible, but not over the top in greatness either. If you were to ever get hired there as a temp, please try hard to find a new job. They treat temps like the scum on the bottom of their shoes there. I never felt appreciated and I always felt used and horrible when I went home at night. The work doesnt leave much time for fun because they expect you to put in massive amounts of over time without care about the fact that you drive an hour a day. If you disagree with anything or anyone you get treated like the plague. I honestly hated the job but I loved my temp manager and I loved the girls I met there."
good,Assisting customers with transactions such as withdrawals and deposits. Opening checking and savings accounts for customers.
good,Busy mostly all day. Upper management can be greedy. The hard part could be meeting goals if you are not in a good area to do so.
good,"If you value selling over customer service, this is the place for you. Managers can be great or the worst- it's theluck of the draw, but if you can't make your sales numbers you are doomed."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"A typical day would include signing in on the computer, loging into all necessary programs. Reading emails, regarding changes, obtaining my first stack of files to process and getting started. I would process files into the system and etc, the entire day."
good,"It's a good place to work, but there are always changes going on. Some departments get cut down, or cut all together. There has been outsourcing out of the country taking away jobs here at home."
good,"Working at wells fargo was ok, i really enjoyed the first year there, our branch was like a family and we all loved going to work, except for the fact you constantly had to sell. The second branch i was at was very difficult having to go into work everyday. There was so much bickering among the staff, and the micro management was unbearable. that started to happen throughout the district once the new district manager came in."
good,I worked for Wells Fargo for several years and the company at one time seemed to appreciate their employees. In 2010 they bought Wachovia bank and seemed to adopt Wachovia's bad employee values which was a decrease in personal health benefits and a human resource department that was less than helpful when an employee needed their assistance.
good,You're expected to have high sales goals but instead of being commended for your performance instead you're always told its not good enough because someone else on the team is slacking off. Also told great place to advance but even with a 4 year degree for a credited university still not qualified to move beyond a teller position in the company's eyes.
good,Pretty much like any other bank. There is oppurtunities to move up. Say there are no sales goals but there always will be especially in this line of work.
good,"Wells was a frustrating mess to work for that would go from mandatory 10 hour days to nothing to to for hours on end month to month with unreasonable and even unfair production goals. an inability to progress through positions, and with continuing issues with business it always felt like they were looking for reasons to fire people."
good,Managers are completely removed from everyday work.  They appear to only manage communications coming down from corporate.  Focus is on whatever they need to do to obtain their bonus.
good,Typical company with good benefits and compensation. Flexible work/life balance over a period of time. Most enjoyable part of the job was to find solutions to otherwise tough problems.
good,"Not able to find full time position despite being a temp-to-hire position, limited visibility and lack of opportunity. Management did not make time to interact with those lower on the totem pole."
good,Little to no supervision and the position was looking for someone with extensive SQL and T-SQL experience and the position was actually a Q/A developer position
good,"The job is stressful and the managers or supervisors act as if you don't know the answers why ask them . "
good,There was limited job advancement unless you were willing to re-locate. I was with the company a year and there was no opportunity to move to a full time position unless I wanted to travel or re-locate. As a military spouse I was unable to do either.
good,Management and leads give conflicting information. And staff get the corrective action if the supervisor or team lead gives them the wrong information.
good,As a teller you have really high expectations. You have to juggle multiple things at the same time. You have goals that you must complete on a weekly basis. They’re not mandatory but the results will impact your grading at the end of the year.
good,I loved my job for the first 6 months then a new manager was hired who belittled myself and my staff.  The site manager did nothing about it.  There was room for advancement but layoffs were frequent.
good,"was not a very friendly, warm environment for new people coming in. felt like high school very clicky. People were not willing to help train you to be successful in your position... it was sink or swim"
good,mostly a good company not competitive wages for what is asked of employees to do on a day to.day basis. Advancement opportunities are limited based on skills but not allowing the opportunity to advance skills.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The person who runs your district will determine your growth in the company. They do not make this determination by the actual time and work you put in, but by whether they actually like you or not."
good,"Wells Fargo is a company that you can work for and make a decent living to be able to take care of your family."
good,"Everyone works hard, but because of high customer demands and impacts from a high turnover rate there is a lot of disorganization on the service side, which makes ongoing training and development much more difficult than it ought to be."
good,Wells Fargo is a roller coaster ride some days are better than others they can’t seem to keep tellers or anyone on the service side happy. I’ve seen so many people come and go. it’s just too much work load especially when their is a revolving door of tellers my branch always has mass quits around holiday season and is the busiest branch in the district yet no other branches were willing to help us out PTo is hard to get approved if at all just go work  for another bank you will be happier
good,"The raises are horrible for different depts depending on what dept there are bonuses  but in the group I worked in only the bankers and mgr got bonuses but the LSS does the work that supports the banker and gets nothing! Worked there for 9 years and maybe received a total of $5 increase with insurance rates increasing every yr.                                                                      "
good,Wells Fargo breeds negative environment for no apparent reason. It's a shame - it could be a lovely place to work - but no one is happy there (due in part to poorly trained managers) which makes it a difficult place to be.
good,Wells Fargo was a swell company to work for. At the time of hire the company was going through changes and focused more on client services. There was a huge emphasis put on bank knowledge and obligations which sidetracked business occasionally but all and all a pretty swell place to work.
good,On a typical work day I would process about 200-300 files a day. My process would be to review these files and make adjustments or fix any errors in the system. I am in charge of one of our bigger companies and I probably have the most knowledge besides the managers on such company. I am always open to helping my peers that we all make our SLA.
good,"I started the banking business at First Union bank and after three mergers they were brought out by Wells Fargo bank, and it went from Sugar to S••• within 90days people started losing there jobs departments begin to close and down size, 17 years of being a loyal and dedicated employee my whole department of 144 people were laid off. They did not care about their employees in 2009. I don’t know what they do now."
good,"Working at Wells Fargo is a great place to work for. They pay above minimum wage, the work experience is great however there are some downsides to this. I work in an in store branch meaning I work from 9:45a to 7:15pm. This is possible by taking an hour lunch. The downside is you don't have any free time after you get out of work. The maximum time I'm allowed to work there is 30 hours. bonuses are based on the hours you get so as a 30 hour teller I only get 75% of whatever bonus we get. I took this job to learn more about investments. I see no motivation in management to help me reach my goals. In order to succeed you must be proactive and realize while they may want to help you they are too busy to try and help themselves with the amount of problems that happens working in a branch bank. The hardest part about working as a teller is fraudsters. If you give cash to a fraudster and you pass a certain threshold you get fired. The most enjoyable part of this is Vacation time is great once you reach a certain amount of years you can take almost a whole month off. If you can succeed as a branch and make it to a banker you should financially be ok to reach your goals."
good,"I feel the stress is created by managers who show favorites and give different information to who they feel should get it.  Stricter with others, rude and sarcastic when questioned."
good,The best part of the job there is no shortage of work and having the opportunity to grow skills is always there. The hardest part of the job is there are too many manual process and to many aggressive timelines due to a high level focus on meeting audit expectations.
good,"Wells Fargo was the most aggressive sales culture in the banking industry. It was very fast paced and because of that  the turn over was over 50% in most retail job families. All banker roles are under qualified as they are taken from the teller line based on ability to push product not on how they can provide financial advice or educational qualifications. They are trying to change"
good,"Like most banks, Wells Fargo is extremely management top-heavy."
good,Over 4 mths to get lending authority. No management involvement. No one knows what the new hire process is.  If you ask a question about test cases they cannot answer because they have not been through the test case process. This should be required for managers to do as well to understand what the new hires are going through and to help them with the expectations.
good,"I worked for the company for 18 years,went through 3 name changes,although the name changed,the culture did not! You advance in Career based in WHO you know,not WHAT you know"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The job was fine. The management not so good rather rude and dishonest.  This was a contracting job for Compliance in the Financial Crime  Unit in Philadelphia
good,"good team, not very difficult interview, too many hours of hard routine work, very low pay rate, good management, nice yang  people to work with, too much information on first few weeks of training"
good,It was fine working in the beginning but when I moved to nc the rules change and management. Left the company after that because manger were terrible and unfair. When stop selling because of the issue that happen manager still force you even know we were suppose to. Just educated clients
good,"The company has room for advancement but is very political, if you are a hardworking employee they will advance you rapidly however, I’ve noticed they tend to keep good employees from advancing to the highest levels to maintain the results within districts as long as they are high performing."
good,"Don't expect to move up unless you are good friends or brown noser with higher-ups. All over the news, we hear about no more sales pushing culture which is completely not true. The only difference now is that sales are called goals and are measured buy profiles and road maps just like every other bank."
good,"Great benefits, but no room for growth or movement. This is an ideal place for someone who wants to remain in the same position for years and years, but for those who wish to grow and develop as an employee, this department is not for you."""
good,The staff was very supportive of needs and questions. I always felt comfortable asking questions and getting answers when I needed. The on site training was very helpful.
good,Wells is still undergoing a lot of overall turmoil. As long as you like change and don't mind dealing with a lot of turnover you may be fine there.. though there's a lot of turmoil there could still be many opportunities
good,"I worked for the analytics group and we were the hardest working set of people there. We worked late every night, including every weekend to get new deals through the door but there was not real reward for it. Even though we worked so many hours we were docked PTO for everything. For example, If we wanted to go see the doctor during the day we were docked PTO."
good,The management does not care about their employees.  They are not the type of people that who feel it is necessary to practice the corporate policy of service base leadership.  They are they type that order you to conform and if you do not they will do their best to get ride of you.  They do not provide guidance on how to o your job and will take every chance to throw you under the bus to make themselves look good to there superiors.  I have worked with this group for 10 months and they have not inttoduced themselves or asked any questions about my background or work experience.  I have twice and many employees reporting to me than any other manager and they do not seem to care nd expect me to manage them as if I only have 15.
good,"Company has a lot of turn around. Tellers, Bankers and Management. Saturday hours are too long 9 - 6.  Salary is lower than competition but sales pressure is very low.  Would not recommend to a friend."
good,Region can vary tremendously. I have been in this company for 9 years and in some areas it is the best company and in others its not even the same company. Shame as its core values are good just not consistent.
good,"Anybody below a Supervisor gets paid peanuts. Everything is micromanaged. They treat adults like children. There is supposedly tons of room for promotion and advancement, but there is a fair amount of favoritism and politics that plays into their hiring and promotion decisions."
good,The company is very focused on moving past the issues they had with pushy sales tactics. They have thus created an overbearing controlled environment where they press the employees  as if they are attempting to take advantage of customers.
good,"The job offers great benefits but the work shifts allotted are not the best. while I am currently working for Wells Fargo I have learned over the past three years about how to help customer manage their accounts, and how to work in large groups,also how to keep up with the constant change of information. The most enjoyable part of my job is new skills that can help me do my job more effectively."
good,My experience my not be someone else's. But I was happy with WF & was moving up swiftly until my last position. For some reason which was never disclosed to me I was targeted by my manager to make working their unbearable.That manager even had the SM do her dirty work of being a hard miserable environment for me to work in. I was told later they were wrong.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"When I was hired on it was made clear I could be moved to a department that better aligned with my college education and experience. After job shadowing once in said department, I told my manager I really enjoyed it and would like to explore that option more. Nothing else was ever done even after multiple attempts of talking to my manager about it. They want you to stay in customer service."
good,"work environment wasn't all that great. The management were not very supportive of your growth within the company and mainly focused on things you were doing wrong without coaching and nurturing growth. Customers are fine, some of them expect that there are no rules within the bank and expect that you break rules for them and sometimes the management lets them."
good,"The only thing bad I can say is there is 6 month notice for a lay off for the department I work in an everyone seems to care less every day. Before the notice it was great, they do kind of throw you on the phones but honestly I cant learn any other way."
good,"Good place to work. Too much turnover, always worried about your job. Culture was negative. Direct managers were good, but not a lot of honesty on future plans."
good,Everything was very slow at Wells Fargo. Employees were not motivated and simply passing time. Ideal for people waiting for retirement. Some people may like it for its stability.
good,"Working at Wells Fargo was pretty fun with the daily fraud, crazy customers, and cool coworkers. There was always something going on. The thing I disliked the most was the terrible business model and scheduling structure. There were SO many times they literally left one teller in the front and back and told us to thank the customer for their patience. It was literally SOOO annoying and it ran out extremely fast. I'm sorry I know customer service can be brutal, but I felt like Wells Fargo cared more about saving money than making sure their employees and customers were taken care of. The pay is great, I mean $15 per hour in NC is hard to come by."
good,Kept very busy within the department's. Continual changes to policies and procedures to keep current with. Held meetings regularly for departmental updates and current event's.
good,"Management is very egotistical and easily intimated by women of color who displays leadership and confidence abilities. Management got this  "" buddy system "" ,  type of relationship among themselves."
good,"The company as a whole is so messed up, it has not been my favorite job that I have had. I worked there for over a year and that was when the lawsuit first starting dropping but I also worked for the call center and the management was not that great and never cared about helping you grow in the company."
good,I was able to come and go as I please. Not much involvement with management or job orientation. I was a roamer and did a bunch of jobs and tasks that were not of interest to employees.
good,"Ops dept is undertrained & understaffed. The result is huge gambles in Risk & Regulation, for which the staff is held accountable & socially silenced."
good,A typical work day in auto wells fargo would consist of making calls to customer with outstanding balances. Also receiving inbound calls answer question of concerned customers looking for assistance with their account.
good,Management is poor. Hours are getting longer. No real incentive. No job security because there are no systems in place for if incidents occur with losses. Culture can be diverse but sometimes culturally inappropriate
good,"It has changed somewhat but still stressful still have"
good,I am a contractor and I am trying to find a position with Wells Fargo. They allowed me to work from home which is so beneficial to me. That made me to get a course in a community college.
good,My supervisors at one time had taken bonus money out of my check and I was not given it. She did have to apologize to me and she was let go. The next supervisor I had was difficult with believing the number of times my mother was hospitalized before she passed away.
good,"A typical day at work, I would start by signing in and getting all the documents that I was going to be scanning for that day ready. I would then scan them and that's pretty much all I did."
good,I would rather not post a review since my experience at the various locations were totally different from each other.  The environment and job responsibility was also very different at each location.  I enjoyed the customer contact and developed many friendships through the years.
good,"Old school. Management doesn't care about employees. You can do your best job yet not recognized at all. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,This was highly publicized.  Wells Fargo did have culture issues that pushed employees to do what was best for the company and shareholders.  I have heard that this has changed and that it is structured to support a more customer-centric environment.
good,"Were always under staffed and dot get paid enough for the work were doing. Work with no breaks, Scheduling is pretty rough, Management makes rules up as they go."
good,"The culture there is pushing sales. If you are a great salesman with no moral compass, you will do great in the company. Anyone with these great sales techniques will move high within the company so there are a lot of young, immature, managers that are very unprofessional. The managers take long lunch breaks and leave the lead tellers in charge of dealing with upset customers."
good,"Offer working from home when weather is bad which is a big plus for people who have kids.  Great teammate, harmony working environment.   But low career growth."
good,"as long as you do what you're supposed, and have no adverse opinions about how the managers or company handle business you can make a long term career with Wellsfargo"
good,"The shift in culture of my department was very disappointing. I did not feel supported and did not feel I could trust my management team. In addition, they would not allow me to move to a team that I felt I would be a good fit and who expressed that they would like me to join."
good,"Overall not a terrible company.  I was there through some difficult times for them, and I decided to leave due to that.  "
good,Customer facing retail job with high stress customer base. The rate of pay is industry standard with decent benefits. Free cell phone service while employed. Opportunities for commission.
good,"As a wealth management intern, I was primarily tasked with cold-calling potential clients and offering refi's or new mortgages for their homes. It was a good learning experience and I learned sales skills, but the advisors were all focused on their own clients, so the workplace environment was not very collaborative."
good,"job was decent. at the time, sales were a huge component to the job which I did not enjoy. good management over all. a little drama in the work place but overall good. job was not hard and I enjoyed helping customers find financial stability"
good,We were informed daily of monthly activities Once in a while we were given free lunches with extra time to eat away from our desks/work area I am no longer employed at wells Fargo
good,It was a great fun company to work with they just do not value you. And when you would like a location transfer they throw you around for months and make excuses. When they will transfer other people behind your back.
good,I am looking for a job in San Luis Obispo County. I am traveling too much to Oxnard / Ventura. The job and people I enjoy but the three hours of traveling is over the top for me.
good,The sales culture is intense and saw bad actors gaming even back in 2012. Had a coworker report behavior of another multiple times only to get retaliated against.
good,My immediate manager was a nightmare to work with. The employees went as far as to band together and go the the Regional Business Manager to complain about her. Nothing was done & the RBC sided with said manager.
good,The management currently sucks. There is obvious favoritism and they take advantage of other supervisors who are under them like lead tellers. They constantly complain about other employees.
good,"The learning curve for corporate business can be learned from Wells Fargo and applied to future employers experience. Advance employment can difficult as the opportunity to advance can be plagued by the internal HR screeners. As they advance based on internal bia's. it would helpful to determine how much experience your future manager has developed with college or prior employment. Many internally managers do not have any prior experience and violate many common office practices and unable to communicate effectively. These same managers would be actively project negative attitudes or bullying. Rather than solve issues, they communicate,       ""why wasn't this caught?"""
good,"each department has a different set of tasks and guide lines to follow."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The division I worked for was under a different manager when I started. It was well organized and felt appreciated. About 6 months after, the manager went on leave for her child and decided not to return to the workforce. The new manager that was hired was not a sutible replacement in my a opinion. Shortly after my separation, she was let go due to complaints of her harassment."
good,Very nice place to work still goal oriented even after lawsuits however now they use different terminology. Great benefits for the most part hours were great manager didn’t really understand work life balance.
good,"Bad upper  management , the bank was getting a lot of bad press with the banking side that lead to customers going to other banks for mortgages.  Mortgage processing & underwriting under staffed, which lead to my customers being satisfied."
good,"Good working environment, pay and job title did not match with duties performed.  Great place to work as long as your salary is competitive with the market."
good,"At this bank they don't care about the customer. Its all about offer offer sell products and offer some more. And in this branch very bad management, Lead tellers taking manager roles bossing you around worse than the branch manager, and the worst part was the talk no control over rumors and gossip whatsoever.Just like in High School."
good,"If you are used to one thing, stay in your district. It is difficult to change districts and regions. I moved for a home that I loved and had to take a promotion I did not want, in a different region and district and they fight fraud VERY differently. What I could and could not do was changed drastically, management would not hear of any alterations. Best and worst part were the customers. I LOVED my old location in Bastrop. New location leaves a LOT to be desired. I felt safe and could trust my coworkers in Bastrop. At my new location, definitely not."
good,Management does no assist with marketing individuals and leads are hard to come by.  All realtors have had a bad experience with Wells due to poor back end and will not refer their clients.
good,"Nothing particularly good to say so it's best not to say anything at all. Actions speak louder than words, I'll let that speak for itself. Might be better in another department but not the one or the location I'm in."
good,There could be a greater focus on team member development especially since sales goals have been eliminated. Also we no longer have sales goals so they could work out a better incentive plan for their employees. A lot of employees salaries were based off of their quarterly bonus compensation. Wells Fargo is a good company but they have to find their placement again after the settlement in 2016 took place. When Wells Fargo had sales goals they had more opportunity for development
good,Poor management. Poor corporate environment. Lots of micromanaging. The employees feel dissatisfied with their jobs due to the culture within the company. Management uses scare tactics to keep employees silenced.
good,We were reminded of offering all Wells Fargo products and services to every customer inbound call. We made sure to thoroughly go over customers accounts and take advantage of any offers available for their personal account.
good,"My time with Wells Fargo was pretty good, I got to utilize my customer service skills as well as show by versatile personality. Every branch operates different depending on the location, so its possible to fit in and be comfortable if placed at the right location."
good,"It was different working within the Wells Fargo Branch in Quarryville. I had come from a fulltime banker position within a hustling branch always filled with customers and opportunities. The branch in Qville was extremely slow, making it most difficult to attain business and sell accounts."
good,Anything related to Wells Fargo is tough sledding at the moment.  Everything is hyper critical and highly scrutinized in the current climate with all the fines.
good,"Great Pay, Bad schedules and constant change. Stressful and extreme amount of pressure to perform. Never enough improve one thing just for them to complain about something else."
good,I worked the back office and processed Home Owner Association payments. I was a temporary employee for the office until they closed the section. I would not recommend because the office closed.
good,"I had a great time with Wells Fargo. Management was rocky but overall I did enjoy working for the company.  I worked at two locations. The first location in soho New York was an amazing experience. Then I worked for the branch in cross county, that’s where management wasn’t good."
good,"Most Job openings are posted with a candidate already in place/chosen. Job openings are just for the sake of compliance. People are applying from within, however, again, a candidate was already chosen."
good,If you take FMLA you are looked at as unreliable and will be passed over for career advancement or opportunities. Wells Fargo does not care about education level in my work level. It's all about your job history. You could of been a manager at a fast food restaurant and know nothing about the department and you'll be hired as an agent for at least 6 months and then promoted to a supervisor once a spot opens and the 6 months is up. Just enough time for you to learn about the department. Meanwhile agents who have been in the same role for years and knows the procedures/policies and the department are looked over because they do not have past manager experience.
good,"I left because I was hired into a position making $30k when most of my team members were making $90k+ with the same experience. After I left, I found out that they were threatened with a lawsuit when other employees found out about the pay difference and they did a huge salary adjustment to make things fair, then laid a bunch of employees off. I was just a number and decided to take my passion and dedication to an employer who would appreciate it."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo offers lip service about customer caring but still has issues training employees to succeed."
good,There is a lot of favoritism and men have more advancement opportunities for advancement and pay increases. My manager happen to be African American and I found ther to be discriminatory and had no filter in passing judge outload about customers unless they here her favorite customers and they happen to be African American. I felt that she discriminated against Hispanics.
good,I liked the Job but some of the policies are not the best. They do not do well with keep employees by working with them. They also are not really good at communication and have their employees best interest at hand.
good,Too much pressure from the management to open new accounts with a shadow account. Poor management in my opinion. Three to four conference calls every day. Report your activity every hour
good,This company started off really well very fast then went down hill super quickly. I started off as a processor for a quick process loan program. I was promoted to a SME (subject matter expert) in a very short amount of time. I was helping with a team then soon after I became a team lead. Workloads were heavy. Goals were set high and expected to be exceeded. Employee turnover was high. Gossip was everywhere. hardest part was separate work from rumors. Most enjoyable was the training I was put in charge of.
good,Working for WellsFargo Operations has been an unsuccessful experience for me because there is little to no training and no grace period for a learning curve for errors. Management approaches at the beginning with threats of discipline for not meeting expected quota. Training is not fully given until errors are made and training is not consistent with every trainer. Everyone is forced to work overtime and management dictates this as mandatory.
good,"Too many managers have been in the company since they were tellers 40+ years ago, and do not embrace change or new ideas. Many are incompetent. Some are psychopaths that have risen to the top."
good,"My time with Wells Fargo was a decent one.  I had a great team, and my original supervisor was fantastic.  We then had an org change and the culture for me changed as well.  We lost money so bonus (on my level) was limited.  They didn't have way to help us gain skills to become more marketable.  They did have Skillsoft programs, but Wells didn't honor those courses when it came time to apply for jobs."
good,"On egg shells and stressful waiting to have a surprise audit. Crazy drudged up customers or gangsters. Loved co-workers, some management breathing down on tellers trying to make us read off a scripted paragraph and I felt like I was a robot. I cant be me in this kind of an environment."
good,"Good company, depending on area. Management will make or break your environment in this company. Moving up is all dependent on who you know, not based on your experience."
good,"Lets just say that the amount of work that I did was't shown in the pay, you had to bust your behind to try and get a bonus and it was a very stressful environment"
good,Management was not up to par..working at this company was very stressful and demanding.  Not a good place to work.  what I've learned is prior to working for Wells Fargo was a great place to work when new management/supervisor comes on board and make changes it made the place from better to worse
good,"I was hired at Wells Fargo in 2009 when the credit crisis and recession began, jobs were available in default services.  But now as economy is better there are less jobs available in default services."
good,Wells Fargo can be a Great place to work if they wouldn't have you traveling all over the place and if they wouldn't take so long to close on your Home Loan.
good,As you all know at the time the sales tactical ways were not ethical which lead to me resigning. Other than that I enjoyed helping clients whenever I could and making sure I did my best to be as ethical as possible.
good,Good company to work for would love the opportunity to work there again and grow. They offer great chance for growth and advancement if in correct dep
good,"Generally, I would say the company has lost its way and there is a big disconnect between the company's stated vision & values and their practice of those values. For every bad employee there are dozens of ethical and well meaning people working hard for their clients every day. Management seems to have become complacent and fallen asleep at the wheel. There is a need to reduce waste, eliminate positions for low performers, and bring all management up to speed with current business practice and business need. In short, time to cut the fat. There are many holdover employees slowing down company progress, and this is seen in many large companies across the country."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I was tasked with  filing Proofs of claim for mortgage loans that had gone into bankruptcy. Learned the different district requirements and worked with outside attorneys and internal departments to insure information was complete. Management was varied from people who had a thorough understanding of what we were doing and the complexities involved to people who had no understanding of the process and just looked at number produced with no understanding of what was involved. Hardest part of the job was trying to explain to a number cruncher that some of the documents we were preparing took more time depending on length of time and how any payments the debtor was past due."
good,"I've been working for this company for 12 years now and in the same position for the past 8. The company as a whole has great benefits and salaries. The issue that I've experienced and noticed with others is their lack of promoting advancement. It is very difficult to move up within the same department much less moving up in another. My personal experience in getting top reviews and being told that they wouldn't know what to do without me yet, won't allow me to grow financially or professionally. With lots of empty promises, it became my time to leave."
good,"The hardest part of the job was my immediate manager and her boss, a lot of favoritism,  along with the poor training most of the days you feel that you are on your own and feels like do not have anyone to go for help."
good,"It is treated like a membership and if one person says or thinks something negative about you, no one vets that information and you are then labeled the outcast and they do a good job of black balling you from employment if you were to leave. No contract or FTE positions will hire you within Wells if the wrong people have the wrong perception about you."
good,"I enjoyed working with Wells Fargo as a teller and i also enjoyed working with the customers. Management was poor, very unfair, not approachable and was not very understanding when it was concerning family needs or emegencies. I was unable to participate in company volunteer programs or activities. Sometimes you felt as if you had to bend over backwards to get your point across and you felt punished when you spoke up for your beliefs and rights and you were mader to be a target not to promoted. If you were not part of the click culture you were singled out."
good,overall very sales driven with no real culture other than driving metrics and micro managing bankers. Opportunities to promote very limited and tough to achieve.
good,the company is going through turmoil which made morale remain low.  Would only give audits every few months and communication between different team members never matched
good,I was a reverse mortgage processor and working to help the elderly was very rewarding. I enjoyed my job and was always learning while employed there.My loan officers were very helpful in chasing documents most of the time.
good,"-Manage loan accounts totaling $2,000,000+"
good,"The Business Associate role is an enjoyable job, however, the recent overall environment at Wells Fargo has greatly deteriorated causing no direction and stress."
good,"Wells Fargo is a very large company and offer great benefits for parents and even soon to be parents. I enjoy the people I work with, but do not enjoy the big corporate world, and feeling like just a number to upper management."
good,Wells Fargo is focused on creating a positive banking reputation for its customers and within the communities it serves. It is a company that is undergoing a change to accomplish its mission.
good,What is there to say? what was reported in the media spoke for itself with the exception that with bankers I saw weren't being aggressive to reach bonuses...they were doing out of fear for their jobs...Local mgt turned blind eye until confronted and still protected some of the offenders.
good,My first meeting with Wells Fargo as a VP was to attend a welcome to First Security Offices and determine how Wells would cut sales incentives to First Security Officers who were making 50% more incentives. In the first 10 minutes the question was do we do it in one month or over a peroid of 12 months.
good,culture can be positive with the right leadership...use technology that is not user friendly.. not too much more can say about this company..if you want an entry level position this may be a good place to start
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company as a whole. You might run into a district with a not so great DM, but overall if you take an active role in your development, it’s possible to advance. They push diversity, but it’s definitely something that they continuously have to work on, as with most companies. They definitely need to work on training managers to be more professional, but again I give the company props for actively working on fixing the culture."
good,"I started out working for World Savings  which eventually was acquired by Wachovia, then WF. Senior management cared more about ranking; too much favoritism; good ol' boy mentality the last 2-3 years I was there.  "
good,"If IT, there's a continuous risk of being under a poor manager or being laid off."
good,"There is alot of room for growth at WF.  Benefits are very good.  As a Manager, the most rewarding part of my job was caring for my team members, knowing them as humans and developing them to self manage.  Investing in their future and supporting them.  All of these actions led to sucess which ultimately benefited the company and shareholders."
good,Wells Fargo can be a great place it depending on the department  you're in. Sometimes you're left alone to do your job and sometimes you are micro-managed and can't get any work done.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Working at Wells Fargo was stressful! It was like working at a sweat shop! I was told by my supervisor that i needed to stop using the restroom. It was difficult to talk to my supervisor, it seemed to me that all they wanted me to do was seat, do your job and don't talk to us."
good,"Absolutely loved being a bank teller, but absolutely hated the risk of job loss for non-performance in a job that was not advertised as being sales oriented"
good,"The workload assignments are not balanced and good people, who are hard working, get saddled with a lot more work as reward for being good employees.  There are too many meetings to discuss what and how to complete work, but does not leave enough time to complete work."
good,"Since the account scandal a couple years ago, Wells Fargo has gone from an enjoyable place to work with great advancement opportunities to a nightmare. "
good,"benefit and pay are good, but customers will always scream at you for what they want you to do even though they already know that against the bank policy."
good,"Poor culture  as evidenced by the small number of competent and neat-appearing professionals. I could say a lot here. but shouldn't. I would think that downtown LA offers you a better scene for true professionals. Management style was very, very bias - not politically, but racially."
good,"Wells Fargo purchase previous company. Only bought our portfolio and unless you were willing to relocate out of state, you were forced to work on the end of lease options only. Went from 90 employees to about 15. Wage decreased after working 12 yrs. Only dealt with unhappy customers."
good,"It was okay to work at. A lot of importance is based on meeting quotas which are difficult but still achievable. However, obtaining them more often than not causes conflict with older employees who feel they were entitled to new customers because of their years with the company."
good,"Mostly work, little play. It was difficult to get to know your team members, as we were never able to talk without being in trouble. The only time we were allow to socialize was during team group activites that took place for one hour every other week. Management was difficult a lot of the time. Worried too much about someone cracking a smile, not whether their work was completed. Stressful most times, mandatory overtime. But, the team and people that I worked with made it a nice place to come to. We did have a large cafeteria and gym."
good,"I have worked for WF multiple times due to my job or department being eliminated. I was hoping at the time that my hard work and dedication would have been seen by upper management, however at the time I was treated like a nobody."
good,Been working there for over 5 years and no promotion. I would like to move to Florida and begin a new opportunity. I am willing to travel if necessary for any interviews.
good,"Other areas of the bank may be different, however for the division I was apart of did not have an environment that conducive for promoting activity.  The chain of command is questionable as do you work for this producer or this manager, which are 2 different individuals."
good,Worked with various departments to achieve one common goal.  Everyone was personable and helped the other person.  This particular location closed and people lost their position.
good,"I am thankful for the opportunity to work from home. Working from home helped me out tremendously. Working as a contactor, i was looked over and was not converted to FTE. 2 other contractors which were hired 1.5 months after me were converted. Management left me out in the wind. Unknown as to why."
good,"Overall, Wells Fargo is a good company to work for depending on the department that you work in and the leadership. Like all places to work it has it's pro's and conns however compared to other companies it is supurb."
good,"The company is far too large to offer sufficient in depth support for the daily employee. Unless you're a big fish, you'll get lost in the sea. The scheduling is horrible and you feel like a nobody."
good,Most of the management team there is a joke. Some of them have never even held a position as a teller but want to tell others how to do their jobs.  They specifically pick on certain people as they find them to be weak.
good,"Wells Fargo allowed me to learn skills that could be utilized as selling points for future interviews.  However the mobility within the company was limited to lateral moves, with hopes that you could move up from there.  Often times there were low ceilings on where you could go and the advancement in pay was also problematic since it was based on tenure and not on the merit of your work.  Management was always fixing mistakes they made instead of putting procedures in place to avoid future mishaps, which became frustrating as an active employee whose goal was to further their career and be as involved with boosting the company as much as possible."
good,Wells Fargo was a good organization for learning. There was not enough training when moving into the mortgage field. The management had too much ground to cover for one person.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Doing Collections is hard and takes a lot out of you as you are almost hackling these people to pay these insane mortgages. There seemed to not be too much we could do to resolve or make things simpler for the customers-my area was not a friendly customer service environment.
good,I had great co-workers.  The Teams were the best.  Management encouraged teamwork.  I was lucky enough to have worked with a team that was a team.  We had each others back.
good,I believe I was paid very low. They would stretch my part time hours to 6 days a week.  Weekends were mandatory.  Did not enjoy being pressured to cross-sell products with no compensation.
good,"Work place culture biased, based on who you know within the company to push you to the next level. The human resource department is out of reach, hold times are long, so employees get frustrated at work, then leave to other companies without expressing their discontentment. Soo much powers in the managers."
good,"It was a great place to work in many regards. Unfortunately, there are some very poor leaders that are allowed to stay in place. There are also amazing leaders!"
good,No positive reinforcement or cohesiveness of the coworkers was supported. at the time I worked there it was Wachovia Bank. This was over twenty years ago and I can't recall more details but I remember not feeling valued and that other representatives felt the same.
good,"This is a great place to learn about the banking industry. But, the company is plagued with dishonesty and low moral. I loved my co-workers, but upper management isn't concerned with what the ""worker"" bee's."
good,"Call in each morning to determine where you would be assigned to work each day. Had to travel to and from that location. "
good,Frequent lay-offs and downsizing.  Company does promote diversity.  A typical days work includes managing pipelines and emails.  Meetings on changes and new releases.
good,Communication is not the greatest. Everyone in this group is hard working. Not a fun environment at all. PTO and Vacation days is really great here. No advancement whatsoever. Dead end job.
good,"Work environment and business practices are antiquated and time consuming.  As a software engineer, development is slow, no real processes are in place, teams are not autonomous and technical direction is micromanaged and handed down from executives."
good,"I would not recommend anyone to Wells Fargo Mortgage, It was so hard to get anyone qualified with the strict guidelines and the processing times were terrible.  There was no room for advancement."
good,Wells Fargo offers many opportunities if you are on the right team and collaboration is a best practice. Depending on your manager you will be given opportunities that will add to your skill set.
good,"It was challenging to run a property while renovating and selling units. I was responsible for renovating 20 units, re-roofing, new docks, landscaping and driveway bidding and project management"
good,a typical day at work was a very fast passed environment with different personalities with customers. Hardest part of the job was promoting accounts. Most enjoyable was that I stayed busy.
good,"I was a temp employee at Wells Fargo who had an extended temp position cut short by one month by a manager as the location was closing out. Initially, I had already assumed as much because temps were in and out every one to two weeks."
good,"Lack of advancement"
good,"If management tells you to do something and it doesn’t feel ethical or the right thing to do, ask them to put it in writing. If it’s not in writing and approved by higher ups, don’t do it."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"This was my first big girl job in college. I was a part-time worker working full-time hours. I enjoyed it at first but we had management changed. On my third week of working, I was expected to know all the ins and outs, talk to over 100 customers within an hour, and sell them products. You were expected to make a sell to every customer. You would get fired if you didn't meet quota. Management only cared about our number which trumped ethics sometimes. The most valuable lesson I learned from working here, was to be myself. I did my job to the best of my ability and looking out for my clients instead of trying to make quota."
good,"I was one of the top performers at Wells. At the end there was so much pressure to make money for the company the management team decided to use tactics like threatening your job security, standing at your desk to make sure you were performing to their impossible standards. I was so stressed out I started to lose my hair, grind my teeth while sleeping which caused my jaw to lock and uncontrollable crying to and from work. I had to leave even though the benefits were outstanding, it wasnt worth my health"
good,"I gained a great deal of financial knowledge, but the way our manager treated us was contingent on the amount of accounts and products that we could refer a day to bankers and it seemed as if that were the only thing that matter; the numbers."
good,"Wachovia was a pleasant place to work, true team atmosphere and cared about the client relationship."
good,"What I said above, they do not train the project manager on their quirky processes and therefore, they receive poor result."
good,"This fast paced and challenging role allows utilizing my skills and abilities while working in a fun environment that offers excellent opportunities, but short stay."
good,"Good people, While working at Wells Fargo, I found it to be a good experience the people are relatively friendly and overall seem to work well together as a team."
good,"great company sales goals are a little stressful because in order to move up you have to cross sale products , but a lot of times the products will not help your customers succeed financially, especially if they do not need the actual service or product."
good,"There were so many wonderful people there, but unfortunately, I was hired to support someone who was difficult, insulting, demanding, and sometimes, just mean. She had been through two other Admins before me and everyone was observing to see how I'd handle the treatment. Thankfully, I'm pretty tough, but there's only so much you can take for so long. The stress proved too much; I opted not to extend my contract when it ended."
good,If worked under the right management there will be a lot of learning opportunities if willing to learn and move in the company it needs to be under the right management
good,Right now Wells Fargo is going through a lot of transition.  Each line is business is being downsized due to poor decisions upper and middle management has made in the past.  Now we are all paying for it.
good,This company use to be great to work at. You could learn and grow. Upward movement was an option. Now everyone is scared to make any level of mistake and speaking up is death.
good,"Pay is average at best, as a contractor. But it can very from 40/hr to 100/hr, just depends on department. Not nearly enough consistency b/w depts in pay, nor is it transparent enough."
good,"Typical work day included conference calls, team meetings, identifying process risks and gaps.  monitoring and gathering statistical data to trend different processes."
good,Low pay for high expectations. This job requires a great deal of personal motivation to stay focused. The benefits are good and you have bankers holidays.
good,As a teller they don't pay you much but expect a lot out of you and they don't pay much on referrals so it is almost pointless to do them. Then to be a banker they ask a lot for a background. Sales are not that hard to do. Also their pay isn't very good.
good,Too many employees per manager. No real structure on who should do what. Very stressful place to work but pay was about what you an expect at a call center
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"A very large company, very easy to get lost.  Many stay for decades.  Older crowd.   Feel like a stable but dinosaur company from the mid 1800s.  The stagecoach once seemed charming but now seems like a liability in the fast moving tech culture surrounding it, the past in contrast with the future."
good,"Very stressful work culture at WF Home Mortgage, but it was nothing compared to the culture at WF Banks. Due to lawsuits, the bank culture has relaxed tremendously, but I doubt the mortgage culture has changed at all. The money was good, but I added 10 years to my life by quitting the mortgage business."
good,"overall wells fargo at the end of the day , all they care about is numbers, and not employees, no room for advancement for people that have been there over 10 to 15 years.they don't give sick days,"
good,"It was a fast paced environment, lots of calls, angry customers, set shifts which was ideal for my situation, starting pay is good, lots of sitting down"
good,"Great company very strict with time management . Great food in the cafeteria, most co workers are helpful and friendly. Great work hours and opportunity for overtime"
good,The work culture was great with team mates in the same branch. The culture with upper management was not alway up front and honest. You where told if you worked hard and did what you are told you would get job advance-this did not alway work.If you where part of the upper management of employees they liked you where able to advance. Also if you ever had to ask for FMLA - management would look for ways to fire that person.
good,"The management is careless, and lack of communications. The work environment has too many constraints and too many failures due to mistakes. It is not fun."
good,"I was there during the super stressful times of Wells Fargo, before they got caught doing their sneaky work behind the scenes. It has changed a lot now but I'm guessing it's not completely gone."
good,"As a customer sales service and sales representative, duties included discovering clients financial needs and suggesting  appropriate products . Also responsible for tending to customer service issues."
good,Have experienced many mixed messages between management expectations and corporate vision and values. There's very little involvement with peers and management.
good,"The analyst position was an exciting challenge, and the work flow was always steady. The management was very shady and wasted hours on end talking about their personal lives during work hours."
good,"They are a company who is all about the customer and although they treat their employees well, they tend to forget what keeps employees wanting to stay there."
good,"I loved working with Shearson Lehman, GE "
good,"They pay you for going to training for 2-4 weeks and the training is nothing like the real thing, the first day the service manager was breathing down my neck and made me so nervous. Most people at the branch that I worked with were so rude."
good,"It's a tough place to work. Not a good culture. Lack of ethics and culture. Needs to change from the top down. "
good,Consistently kept in the dark of positions and compensation.  A take it or leave it attitude from Management.  No additional advancement opportunities.
good,As a personal banker a normal day would include all customer inquires to be handled diligently with a process of discovering the customer needs by a asking a serious of questions. Once the need is discovered offering the best product was required. The hardest part was the culture the company had with unrealistic sales quotas. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping meet their financial goes.
good,It was good starting out. It could have been a lot better. There is no room for advancement within the company. They talk about how they always hire from within but its not true.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"open branch, run bags, approve teller transactions, buy and sell money with tellers, lead huddles, stage coach, coach tellers on how to have meaningful conversations with their customers, help close the branch."
good,"Not having 2 days in a row off is a huge detriment, given the stressful position of call center work. Split days off is not feasible, nor is it healthy for the physical and mental welfare of employees."
good,"I found Wells Fargo to not be conducive to a work life balance despite what is said in the HR literature.  Also, if you complained to HR, you became an ""HR issue"".  It made you feel like you couldn't say anything negative to anyone."
good,Decent place to work. Could be a great place to work if you have a manager who is fair and has an open door policy. Make sure you know who to trust and who you can't.
good,Extremely stressful and micro mananged. Incentives have dimisinsed substantially which  has really decrased moral. The current management is detached from the direct reports which really gave the processors no direct support.
good,"There are entirely too many organizational changes which result it a lot of changes that filter down to the branch level.  This makes it very hard for healthy staff development. If you notice a high turn-over rate, staff that look stressed while they're at work and issues in service then know there are problems. I'm very disappointed with the uneccesay aggressive subculture that is a cancer that pushes talented team members out."
good,"The workplace culture is a grind at times, but as long as your provide your own drive, you can make it in this company. The hardest part of the job is the lack of communication of the companies/department's goals and what is required to achieve them."
good,"Very Stressful, Not entirely true leadership in upper management. Compensation not great. typical corporate structure work hard so upper management can earn more."
good,I enjoyed the atmosphere and felt that it would be a fun place to work. Then the micromanaging became ridiculous. they didn't look at the positives that representatives did for there customers but the smallest of issues that would not make a difference in goals meet or customer satisfaction.
good,"Very easy and relaxed but not much room for improvement. Great hours because of the banking hours, got to take a good amount of time off. Slightly overworked and over scheduled."
good,These were two organizations with mature processes and who invested in growing their employees with customer and employees as their priorities.  The focus on hierarchal power and patriarchal thinking limited the personal and the organizations from execution at a higher level and resulting limiting their revenue and employees income.
good,"In the Carolinas and you are a victim of a lay off victim, don't look for a re-hired unless you are a low wage worker, or know people.  Management tend to not care about its employees and what is discussed in HR.... is not often held confidential."
good,Worked in Auto Loan underwriting. Very little training offered. Communication issues between management and underwriting. Good benefits but low pay. Large company.
good,"Project Manager was great and very helpful; However, the manager was very unprofessional and passive aggressive.  I was lucky the manager worked in a different state and I didn't have to work directly with the manager.  I worked well with the entire team except the manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the team."
good,It is a pleasure to make work some unique and wonderful people here at Wells Fargo in the reverse mortgage department.  We have a sense of family and always look out for each other.
good,"enjoy, but its time to grow.  I have a lot of work/ life experience and a degree and I am paid the same as those that are half my age and no degree. its frustrating."
good,Never met with my manager who lived across the US in MN.  It was never pointed out what my responsibilities actually were while I worked for this company.  It was boring with very little work and the company itself at Corporate was blah.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I worked on the data entry side and my manager promoted me quickly because of my ability to transfer data quickly and accurately. This also came with a raise which was very substantial even though it was a temporary job
good,Difficult to advance after reaching a certain level within the company.  They do offer good benefits and vacation time. Do not feel there is enough diversity within company once a certain level is reached.
good,"Lots of projects.  Deadlines change a lot and requires adjustment of planning, etc.  Some Projects use Agile and Waterfall with different work efforts included."
good,"This was a good starting place to work at. The managers and other employees were mostly nice, although there were some times where I did not agree with their practices."
good,"Come into work, serious environment, cant be to loud because the managers are on the same floor, management is friendly, with hold conversation with employees, the job is not difficult it is repetitive, the most enjoyable part of the job are the people you work with makes its well worth it"
good,"Phones all day, lucky to be able to have meetings and 1 on 1's. Depending on your manager lucky to be able to advance your career, lack of support. "
good,"Wells Fargo pay scale is poor. Some people advance most don't. Plan to be very patient for career advancement. All mangers I have had a Wells Fargo were poor. Most managers are legacy Wachovia, where it was easy to advance all you had to do was have great work performance, though everyone who performs well is not management material or has what it takes to manage a team."
good,working for wells fargo has been experience. I have worked I different departments and dealt with different policies and procedures. I have enjoyed my time at this company.
good,"The best thing about working at my Wells Fargo location was the job culture. They were all very nice, supportive, and understanding as it pertained to my job function. However, there were many things that I didn't agree with that my management did. The would turn the blind eye to some of the actions their favorite associates did and at the same time they were quick to write up others with actions they didn't like. It was a matter of favoritism. Management was a lot tougher on the teller than the personal bankers. Tellers had a half an hour break while bankers had an hour break. There were numerous actions that were unfair. Through my employment, I've learned a lot of the banking industry and learned that this role and environment wasn't for me."
good,A typical day was mostly data entry and phones. I learned never to ask for additional work because it was always more that you could handle. Management needed more training in being a manager.
good,"For the role I'm in, I feel that the risk I'm taking is greater than my compensation. It's very hard to move up into management because the recruiters hardly ever take into consideration your past experience before working at the bank."
good,This is a good job if you are looking for something stable. The management team doesn't know what they are doing. Overall this job is a good stepping stone to something better.
good,Always pushing sales even though technically there are suppose to be no sales. From my experience you can only ascend the ladder if you converse with customers about wells fargo products.
good,My opinion is not relevant for this company since they no longer exist. I cannot in fairness rate Wells Fargo because I only worked for the company as Wachovia.
good,"I'm looking for a career, not a job. I'm making less than 1/2 of what I was used to making (even though I'm negotiable on pay). There are some wonderful people there, however, I have a different work ethic than many of the workers there (not to be ugly)."
good,"The branch that I worked at had a lot of politics, but they will work hard with you to improve your sales. When I was working there they were really sales heavy, but they work as a team. Cut-throat industry and stress level off the charts. I hear its different now, but they made you sell sell sell."
good,I have not worked at this company for years things may have changed so I have no clarity on new policies or procedures If the job fits just work it is my opinion
good,I worked at Wells Fargo for eleven years and unfortunately I saw the company decline to a level that required un fair practices regarding accounts and sales for customers. I would not recommend working for this company
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The best way I can sum up Wells Fargo is that it is a company with a great vision and values but poor execution of these values. This results in a very inconsistent workplace experience and really hinders the ability to meet your goals. Company benefits are excellent; starting with 3 1/2 weeks of PTO which can be expanded up to 6 weeks PTO if you stay with the company. Great 401k matching and the medical/dental/vision is very affordable and comprehensive. Also a lot of people don't realize how much money you can save in certain fees by having the team member checking, which is a plus. Also fairly easy to maintain a good work/life balance if you're willing to plan ahead, but doesn't leave a lot of flexibility for last minute events or emergencies."
good,"Was a contractor with Wells Fargo and was criticized and treated as a contractor. Had no paid time off, workload varied day-to-day and sometimes you did not have any work other days you had too much."
good,A typical day is peaceful. I have a great team of co-workers who mesh well together. Management in my department was great. They make your day enjoyable.
good,"Loved everyone that I worked with, but management didn't really support you. The always chose the end user over you. Unless you have been there for 10+ years there is no growth"
good,"Knowledge of the values and practices that align customer needs and satisfaction as primary considerations in all business decisions, and ability to leverage that information in creating customized customer solutions."
good,"learning and diverse environment with room to grow"
good,"I was evaluated for stats and was told that I needed to not be ""so customer service oriented."" This was one of those jobs where you are constantly being timed on calls and yet are supposed to collect money from the customers. It was frustrating being reviewed so much and critiqued. Managers weren't very helpful with issues and wanted the difficult situations to just go away."
good,"I loved my position as Home preservation specialists however, I got deathly sick and was in the hospital for a week at which point they terminated my position then forced me to submit for pto and then turned around and charged me for the pto."
good,"The financial advisors are only concerned for themselves and that attitude comes from the top, whether its stealing each others clients or bending the rules."
good,Client interactions excellent. Culture is a work in progress at this time. Leadership not understanding the needs of the clients from an L&D perspective.
good,"Good Culture"
good,They like to come to people at end of shift and make them feel as if they have to stay or there job depends on it. They also like to make people come in on there day off so managers can have an extra day off. Holidays are the worst. If it is your day off you can for get out that then to cover there butts will tell you that you don't get Holiday pay but that they will give you a floating holiday later in year.
good,"Sales goals have been eliminated, which is good. However changes to thier incentive compensation model have been trial and error, and as of now are very unfair to tellers vs everyone else at the branch level. Depending on which branch you work at, you can have a very positive experience or negative."
good,Helping people to attain a home was my most enjoyable experience in this industry. I had to learn to manage my own business...from beginning to end. I enjoyed working with the public and helping them with the most important purchase of their lives. I was my own boss and answered to no one but myself. I miss the day to day business atmosphere.
good,I demonstrated my ability to do my job far above and beyond the requirements of the position. I automated my (and my co-workers') jobs to a high degree and immensely improved our process. I got a promotion. I had the promotion denied on political grounds in a management urinating match. I plan to not work for Wells Fargo again.
good,Management - overworked and stressful. Everyday you do not know what is going to happen. They are good days and bad. My manager treats me as an employee. If I ask to come in an hour late or leave an hour early I have to use my PTO time when I work 50+ hours a week.
good,"sales based job unreachable sales goals, retail and online bankers pressured to make sales goals that aren't reasonable, a day at work consist of getting as much sales in a day as possible"
good,"Advancement was a joke at this place.  You were promised one thing and never given a chance.  The money was ok, and most of the people were friendly.  Depending on the branch you were working at, you could have a great time working or a bad day everyday."
good,"It allows you to do your job without intervening with anyone, everybody keeps to themselves so privatized it feels like you cant become friends with anyone"
good,Their mortgage department is a well oiled machine in a factory.  You will do well and make above average pay if you produce.  They will train you.  They will coach you.  They have well established protocols and instructions for every situation.  There is no winging it.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"all duties are the same as at CU companies, however this was a very stressful environment to work within. Layoffs were part of the wells fargo workplace."
good,"On a phone dialer all day, unlimited over time, end of the month 12 hour shifts are mandatory, tough loan goals team and individual nights and weekend required"
good,"you could have a perfect call and the customer could love you and say you were perfect and amazing, but your supervisor will find something wrong with your call and then spend an hour criticizing it"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the long lasting friendships with coworkers.  Management encourages a lot of team building and volunteer activities.  "
good,We do team building activities to try to build the department moral. Management could use some improving. It;s a great place to work but hard to advance.
good,"Typical work day consists of "
good,I learned work as a team. I like the communication which I had with  my boss. To much precision and express every day as a consequence I learned how to handle both.
good,"The overall culture at Wells Fargo is fast paced and exciting at times. My coworkers are friendly and the management is knowledgeable. However, be prepared to fend for yourself and to be offered very little training before you are ""thrown to the wolves""."
good,"Working at Wells Fargo was a great experience, there were a few things that could of been handled more professionally and some management should not of been over certain aspects of the department due to they did not have the experience or knowledge to be directing their employees."
good,Production was more valuable than the customer. High pressured sales over customer service. Pushed tellers to ask the same questions day in and day out.
good,"Promotion is not given out on merit, rather if you're in the club.  Management is a disaster, and because of this turnover is very high.  There is no incentive to go ""above and beyond"" because only the chosen favorites receive any credit for anything that goes right."
good,Again it's been a long time since i have worked here however it was very hard to go home every night knowing i was peddling products to consumers that didn't need them. Sales practices highly unethical and upper management put too much pressure on employees to follow these practices. I hope it's changed.
good,Wells Fargo is a good company to be associated with. Work life balance is good and can be taken taken as long term serving option. Learning wise the company is on the slower side
good,"I had been working for Wachovia, when Wells Fargo bought it out.  Once that happened the entire culture changed, and I was very unhappy with that change.  We were required to pretty much push products and services on current customers, which I was not comfortable with and neither were the customers."
good,depending on management you may have either the best or worst experience. its hard to keep to yourself and work despite a strong worth ethic you are pulled down and kept from advancing if you dont rub elbows and befriend the right individuals.
good,answered phones and help people with the account. help people understand there account and what they are doing. help people open and close checking and savings account
good,"Previously the culture encouraged development and finding opportunity."
good,"Okaywork place, high demand of stats, goals set to increase revenue and bonus/commission not very attainable. Diversified work place to encourage all walks of life"
good,Working at Wells was a great opportunity but was difficult to succeed  in the working model that they had. The management was lackluster and I never felt value from the company.
good,"it is a good company to work for in terms of benefits and compensation but try to look for a branch that you identify yourself with in terms of work culture. I have worked with different teams in my stint with the bank and how well you guys understand and work with each other helps a lot. in addition, mindset of the branch is also helpful. I have worked with an outstanding team that hit goals and awards every time because every one helped and pushed each other, and I have also work in branch that had a ""group of people"" and not a team, needless to say I hated coming in especially on Mondays."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,A lot of changes have been made since being in this department and I would not be able to give a proper review of the current work environment. The sales department is about offering financial solutions to customers.
good,"As a part-time teller, I learned early on that tellers as a whole tend not to move up in the corporate ladder. Having knowledge of all federal regulations was difficult as well. Typically, we were expected to have semi- or complete knowledge of how to handle a variety of transactions, ranging from deposits to EFT (Electronic Fund Transfers). Management was initially supportive, but quickly cracked down on tellers who were unable to perform. They did offer extra training to those who weren't able to keep up, but generally it was ineffective."
good,Very structured work place. Very inclusive of everyone. Management lacks the training need to help employees succeed. There isn't a real training class for most positions.
good,"Daily work responsibilities, as well as management, at Wells Fargo is typical of any large corporation.  The culture is inclusive, however, the production areas of the company are numbers driven and can be demanding and stressful depending on the position, especially since late 2016."
good,"While I did not necessarily get along with everyone outside of work, at Wells Fargo the team worked well together. Customers can be a bit demanding with this job due to handing client finances but if you are able to multitask and enjoy customer service this is a great job opportunity."
good,Company changes for the behave of its self and not its employees and customers. The company moved from hard work pays off to who you know that will help you get to the next level.
good,pay was not that good you really have to sell a lot of broker fee in order to get paid out something I would recommend only if your starting out in sales
good,"Management expectations were too high.  Staff to broker ration was low.  Work environment was nice and staff did get perks, but pay was low considering the amount of work and pressure you were given."
good,"Reputed company, Fun Workplace, Liked the office environment. There were few free lunches. It was good experience to work with one of the manager at Wells Fargo."
good,"A corporate company that requires knowledge of rules, regulations and company policies. I only worked seasonally, so I did not qualify for benefits or vacations."
good,"Everything done dies in underwriting, hard to work within company expectations and close the number loans needed to make a living.  System set up to make company money and leave consultants broke"
good,"Coworkers are great, management sucks. dont let them fool you. its inbound/outbound. you dont matter here. they are continuously hiring, this job is for people who dont know what they want in life."
good,"managers fail to go above and beyond for their teammates, but are dependent of the other teammates to do the same for the manager. those hired to fulfill that position should attain  a more interactive training module."
good,I was in high school and was working fromm 11pm to 4am and still had to manage school it was to hard to stay awake in class or show my full potential in my work
good,"The work place was very consistent daily, You clock in and do your job the same way every single day. The Only issue i really had with this company was the insane sales goals and conning people into opening accounts that they clearly did not need. I don't enjoy being a part of companies that say they pride themselves on Honesty and integrity, when they are blatantly lying to peoples faces just for the next sale."
good,"very diverse company, excellent benefits, flexible work schedule, very engaged in community events, many opportunities for advancement and continuing education"
good,"Workloads were different everyday, not knowing what time your shift would end daily was a challenge.  Great people and Mgmt made it easy to get the job done."
good,Individual offices were good to work for. Each office has it's own atmosphere. There is a family feeling with the local office. Management leaves something to be desired.
good,"This job was difficult. It is something I would NOT suggest for anyone that is in college. The hours were difficult to manage around school. As well, sales was a huge issue. If you didn't hit your goals, you were reprimanded in front of everyone."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Bank Teller"
good,"Little room for advancement.  Very secretive.  Low salaries.  Little bonus.  Culture is solely about profits, not a welcoming atmosphere.  Loyalty from management is not a factor."
good,The company is very big. So big that it is difficult for people to really matter. A lot of hiring and firing. My one year here almost caused me to totally doubt myself and lose self-esteem.
good,If you are a fan of being micro-managed this is a great place to work.  Things may have changed in the organization since I've been there though.
good,"I prefer not to elaborate on working for this company for over 20 years, other than to say that it has afforded me opportunity to earn the funds needed to raise my family and have a decent lifestyle.  What more can a person ask for?"
good,Great place to learn and gain experience.  Re-orgs are always occuring.  Management moves slowly. It is important to have a wide network here.
good,Gives you good experience starting out in the finance industry.  Important to have a large network when working here.  Re-orgs are always occuring.
good,"If you are looking for a paycheck then work here."
good,Like any other pressure of a sales job with good benefits. If you're up to the pressure then the benefits are good. I learned many skills to build rapport with clients.
good,too much reliance on foreign workers ---experienced staff has left or will be leaving ---inept project management and weak managers remote from where any of the projects are occurring
good,Management is somewhat unprofessional. There is little to no guidance or training to be prepared for the position. Criticism is given daily without the proper tools to correct mistakes.
good,"Not very friendly, I really liked the people i worked with. But management was unfriendly. Would do anything to reach sale goals or you could loose your job."
good,Standard corporate environment. Trained to build relationships through robotic interaction. Preaches work life balance. Large company with room for advancement for those who can succeed.
good,It's hard to move up in the company and they want you to take on more responsibility without the appropriate pay. Their reputation isn't the best considering what has been covered in the media recently. They are shipping more jobs overseas
good,Had to work 6 days per week to meet sales goals. During a sales push they would have us on conference calls every two hours. Asked employees to stay late to meet sales quotas.
good,My experience was pleasant.  The employees here were all nice and accommodating but the office lacked what many job seekers desire from the workplace.
good,Very negative reviews towards the end of my tenure before I resigned. With district manager and previous management. Current management at location  is fantastic.
good,Wells Fargo had wonderful benefits and understood the balance between family life and work life but I didn't appreciate the sales. It was hard to meet such a high sales quota and the management was unprofessional and disrespectful when you didn't meet your quota. Be
good,"not the worst place to work but if you aren't putting up numbers they're not going to promote you in the branch.  Not that its any different from the other banks."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Excellent Pay and potential for bonus (if you're sales driven.)"
good,Did not enjoy seeing people cheating the system advance in their career. Felt like you are only as good as what you did the day before. Even though integrity was preached management shut their eyes to the truth because it benefited their numbers as well.
good,Really enjoy the people I work with and meeting new people. Treat customers with respect and all the same Fair. Learn how to deal with different clientele and planning is a must. You are responsible for a lot of cold calls so keeping track of what you have done and being organized is a must
good,"Would recommend to anyone who wants to work in finances,but it is no longer a company whose views I share. The work/life balance is great and a healthy ammount of paid time off every year."
good,"not a very pleasant environment. they hire part time workers but have them come to come 5 days giving 4 hours a day, horrible."
good,This is a fun place to work if you have the write management team. The management team I had just wanted to work me to death. You did not get promoted like that. This was a good place if you are starting a career path.
good,I enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo but after the sales culture was in complete disarray it was time for a career move. I hope things have changed.
good,"Wells Fargo is a company who constantly tells us that our employees are what gives us a competitive advantage.  Unfortunately the company has no desire to keep talented employees and insists on paying well below the mean amount for all the jobs in the company.  Advancement within the company is one of the most frustrating activities I have ever experienced in my professional life.  And I don't feel secure in my position, which is why you are finding my comments here.  If you can get the same job anywhere else you'll get paid more and probably respected more as well."
good,"Consumer Financial Services, work in high volume call center. Receive inbound calls from internal and external customers. Provide customers with status of their loan for various consumer products (auto, personal lines, credit cards) Communicate underwriting decisions on credit applications alongside originators and fulfillment team members for auto, credit card and personal loans and lines."
good,"The hardest part of job, was being calm when people would yell about their fee charges. Wells Fargo is not family oriented, they are very commercialized because they are a huge bank. Just hope they will be more for the people one day."
good,"Great environment to work, great hours, some of the supervisors are very helpful and knowledgably. loved the bonus and over time"
good,i didn't really liked the job because it wasn't team member environment. what I like the most about the job that I got teller experience . the management was unprofessional. lack of training on the job.
good,Wells Fargo is a great starting place if you want to get experience in the finance industry. They have great training and will work with you to expand your sales skills. The pay is lower than average in the industry and pay raises are minimal.  If you are interested in learning come to the company but be prepared to leave for more money or advancement.
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers and the challenges associated with auditing their accounts, but I did not feel like I was treated as a valued employee. Wells Fargo put a great deal of emphasis on selling new products to customers with the belief that more products would make the customers stay. My Co-workers were great and a joy to work with."
good,"Good company bad managers,open accounts that customers dont need. If you do not do what the managers unethically  asking you to do. They will make your life miserable. Overall bad management and dont bother to call HR or the ethic hotline they will not do anything to help,"
good,"Above average benefits, company is too big, no guaranteed salary is the biggest issue at the present time. There is little chance for advancement in my current position."
good,"This company is one of the largest banks in the area. It offers overall stable employment, decent benefits and entry level banking experience."
good,"For the most part, the work is independent and can be repetitive. As an underwriter, the primary responsibility is to review documentation, make a decision, and then report the decision. For an introverted and decisive personality, this could be a good fit (I wouldn’t consider myself an introvert, which is one reason I am looking for new employment). For a person who enjoys working with others, and would like a variety in their daily responsibilities, this would not likely be rewarding or enjoyable."
good,"No time for career planing."
good,The company is good to work for but you have to deal with a lot of outrageous goals set by the heads of this company. The pressure that you are put under to make these goals each and every month are stressful to say the least.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I learned how to process all financial transactions efficiently. It helped me grow in my customer service face to face skills.
good,"High stressed sales environment, easy to get fired, horrible management, unethical sales environment. You will be working as a number in a big corporation."
good,"great place to work,  but its a sales job.  meaning you dont get the accounts, or loans,  they write you up.  oh, they find something to write you up about.  i mean I loved it dont get me wrong, and 75 percent of the time I went above and beyound in sales, but man I dont need someone making me feel like I am not good at my job and then writing me up on something that was never an issue 18 months ago when I started.  They think it will motivate you, it just f with your head.  some guys did some shady stuff just to open accounts.  yet I did enjoy the job.  if your ok at sales you will like it enough."
good,Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is a very diverse environment. Benefits that was offer through the company was decent. Management just need to be a little bit more Professional.
good,There was a worker who passed out and died at work. We were told after his body was removed to get back to work. No option was given for leaving due to mental state.
good,Worked for Wells for 20 yrs. If you aren't a high pressure sales person this job is not for you. The pressures placed on branches makes for poor ethical practices
good,Challenging corporate culture - at the time.  Lacked flexibility and not very inclusive. Difficult to effect much needed change to marketing proposal w
good,"A typical day at work consist of assisting client with personal finances. Identifying needs through fact finding questions that enable my co-workers and I to provide solutions that organize and improve personal short term and long term goals. Ive learned how to ask right questions that uncover issues for our clients. This is very important because it produces the ability to buffer possible problems that weren't foreseen in the future. Management is good. They work with you to improve your skill  so that you not only do well for your clients, but also for yourself and goals. The hardest part of the job is when  efficient help isn't given because a client may not qualify for a loan or some other type of credit product that is needed immediately. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I am able to solve issues that the client not only comes in with initially, but also other problems that could possibly be detrimental in the future."
good,"Busy open to close."
good,"A good first introduction to baking, very professional in the way everything is laid out.  Assisted customers with banking needs, translated for Spanish customers, mainly counting cash transactions and selling banking products. Friendly coworkers, but an unpleasant approach from management.  Learned the perseverance necessary for sales, due to a saturation of the market and a down turn in the economy.  This was tough.  The banks approach was to cross sell every single customer you saw, despite the existing relationship or lack of interest from customers."
good,The only enjoyable part of this job was working alongside my colleagues and getting to know the customers. Management was pressured from upper management to push numbers which caused lots of tension. The company seemed to lose touch of the customers best interest.
good,For Fresher there is lot of scope however for Tenured people growth is main concern. You can work here maximum 3 years post that you need a change for sure.
good,dont really care about the customer unless it benefits the workers in some way. sales sales sales what have you don't for me lately mentality
good,"Great Benefits, Terrible environment depending on which location. held you move up in the company. You end up learning great skills."
good,"A typical day of work was not too stressful. Easy going environment. However, kind of small work spaces. I was only a temp so I can not speak on how it would be as a full time worker."
good,Moved from an Accounting Specialist to a Loan Representative allowed more growth in my professional career. The most enjoyable part of both positions was flexibility and trust of management.
good,"When I started working at Wells Fargo, everything was easy to meet and there was very little pressure.  "
good,"How well you do depends entirely too much on your immediate supervisor - quality ranges from stupendous to absolutely awful and there is very little meaningful standardization of processes and information.  Employees in Home Preservation are at the beck and call of mgmt. for overtime or Saturday work, raises were almost non-existent, parameters to make bonus income were ratcheted higher and higher and micromanagement has become more prevalent in the past year - many employees on edge 24/7 which is a shame since I have worked with many wonderful coworkers there who worked as hard as they could, and with a positive outlook, despite with the limited training offered and very cumbersome and not-user-friendly software systems."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,if you starting they have a good training but the expectation of what you can provide and produce is way off the charts so good luck with that
good,The experience was invaluable and greatly helpful to my knowledge of the industry as a whole but the environment or culture could be greatly improved.
good,"The typical working day revolves around answering incoming customer calls, sorting through new & current accounts wanting to refinance their mortgage, & responding to company as well as customer emails."
good,"A typical day with this company: Get to work early so that you can sign into all programs that you will need to use for the day, The computers were super slow. Once you have all the programs pulled up say a prayer and get to it. You must be very productive in this field of work.Management only know you if you rank real high or real low if you are in between they wont know who you are. My original team I started with may the work day go by so easy. We were the most hated team within that particular site because everyone was young, very motivated, and we came in and ranked at the top. Once we switched teams and were under new management coming to work was like pulling teeth"
good,"The company has a lot of room to branch out into different departments if you live in metro areas. My typical day consisted of open accounts, taking loan applications and handling customer concerns and questions. I learned that I do not like a high pressure sales environment. My manager was great, she was relatable and down to earth. Our district manager was not well liked, he only cared about the numbers. The most difficult part of my job was the sales goals. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to help customers that really needed it and the relationship you built with them."
good,"Great people i worked with, we had a family environment where it did not even feel like work. As far as store level the management was great, Higher ups do put some pressure on you, but that's expected. Overall a good place to work for"
good,Corporate atmosphere.  Very involved in communities including volunteer work with employees.  Great United Way sponsor.
good,"Best benefits I have ever had in my life , no family life due to the hours you have to dedicate.You have to work 2 late nights which is not so bad but the last 2 to 3 days of the month is called cradle to grave meaning you are there from 8am to usually 9pm ."
good,"Cash Handling and assisted customer with everyday financial needs"
good,"Good place to work. Gym, Cafeteria, and excellent security at workplace. Great Team Members. Nice working tools. Building is major data center for Wells Fargo."
good,"The coworkers are enjoyable. There is alot of opportunity for learning new skills. The learning curve is steep and long. New hires are brought on low on the pay scale, with a promise that a pay raise is just around the corner. Annual raises are capped at 2% for everyone. Promotions and pay increases have to go through 4 levels of management to be approved and take months to process. There are no company sponsored events. Health / Dental / Vision insurance is not expensive, but doesnt cover much other than basic routine care."
good,I love my branch and my manager and i really love my team! The hardest part of the job is the feeling that we are never doing good enough even when we are well above the goals! I feel that there is no work life balance and there is no compassion for the employees. all they care about is you making numbers. The enjoyable part is the co workers relationship that we create...
good,"Not your typical bank, be prepared to sell as if you were in a more traditional sales job.   Quarterly quota and the bonus is low.  The call night concept is not best in todays society; noone wants to hear from their bank to get a credit card at 5:30 in the evening.  Retail mentality of keeping the floor covered."
good,"I was cornered in an SBA role at a conservative bank with no presence in the Chicago area, which made it very difficult to bring in business. Currently Wells has no plans to expand or buy any banks in the Chicago/Midwest region."
good,Long hours with little reward. Good job if you have selling skills and you know people with money that will be willing to switch to you.
good,"Good company, I just had a horrible supervisor. But I guess you could have a bad experience with any company. Even though I wasn't allowed to transfer I continued to do my job. Co-workers were great leads were more knowledgeable than the supervisors which lets you know they do not promote within."
good,"typical day at work : taking care of the customers, making commitments of the day and ensuring you help the customer with all of their needs."
good,"Typical day at work consists of deposits, withdrawals, processing payments, daily sales. I work with a great team. I love working with a vast variety of people of the community, and leaning something new each day. The busiest time of my day is my most enjoyable because that's when I feel most producible."
good,its a decent place. sometimes busy. hardest part was coming not knowing a lot and not having a decent training time set out to learn the process.
good,"I really thought this would be where I would be able to grow professional and develop a career."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Job Work/Life Balance Goods - Job Security/Advancement and Management Bad. Overall rating three out of five stars. Nice salary for contractor. Nice Job. No Job Security/Advancement.
good,"Managers where typically not helpful or wanting their employees to improve and move on to bigger and better things. Not a good environment for people with kids, unfortunately."
good,"Had great coworkers but the sales goals were some times unattainable with out being pushy on the clients.  I had learned a lot with banking and multiple  banking software that we had to use.  The greatest part of the position were some of the clients.  Many were hard to deal with if they had been calling about a late payment or something frustrating them on a bill or statement, but in the end I was able to de-escalate the situation and help them with what they needed."
good,"A typical day of work for me was very busy and fast pace. Production driven. I really enjoyed this job as i was a short sale negotiator in which i process, underwrite and closed short sales for all investor segments including FHA. I learned a lot about the liquidations process from a different side other than first and second stage collections. The management i had was not so good. I was often updated after the fact of things that should have been address prior to providing different data and functions in that role. The hardest part was maintaining a pipeline of 200 files. Processing short sales from A to Z including scheduling escrow and closings was a long process. My most enjoyable part of the Job is when i receive messages and gifts from clients thanking me for my work."
good,"long and sometimes long day"
good,"flexible hours, good income. Great for someone that is working and studying at the same time."
good,"Customer Service& Sales"
good,I worked 8-5 very laid back relaxed environment. I enjoyed the people also.
good,Too small branch. 7 personal bankers and only 4 desks. hard sales quotas
good,"A typical day at work involved answering customers concerns and questions about their accounts. After assistig customers we offer a product or service that will better their business. "
good,"Although some day were very busy, I always enjoyed the interactions with both customers and co-workers."
good,"Worked nights as a Windows support contact on a bridge line during a large refresh project. There were a few techniques I learned regarding the bank's hardware, which might come in handy if I were to come across these hardware items again. The co-workers I worked with were knowledgeable, friendly and courteous. The hardest part of the job was that it involved a large amount of time sitting for 8-10 hours a night, sometimes with big gaps of down time, but when it became busy, it was non-stop until the end of the shift. "
good,"*Leading team to having successful days by setting expectations and following through."
good,"banking, relocation expected. no further comments are desired to building any expectations. co workers were fine."
good,The company is great to work for. They pressure you a lot to make sales. I happen to work in a slow branch and a goal of 13 a day is very hard to manage and maintain throughout the entire quarter. The team members are very nice but you are pushed very hard.
good,"Was able to advance at certain points, but also had a hard time with advancement in other departments. Overtime was often mandatory."
good,A typical day of work at wells fargo would consist of answering calls and assisting customers in any way you can. I have learned allot about the personal and business side of accounts and credit accounts and mortgages. Also sales side of the banking world as well. Management and co-workers were pleasant. The hardest part of the job was the fact that they slowly tried forcing you into moving into the sale position. The most enjoyable part of the job was actually getting to help the customers. Instead of trying to force them to get more accounts.
good,"This company was okay to work for. I loved seeing my customers consistently. I didnt feel much support from management, but lots of pressure to sale sale sale."
good,Many of the managers lacked the creditials and/or work experience to be in the roles they were given.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo used to be one of the greatest banks to work for back in the day. A lot has changed after the wachovia merger and the bank started drastically cutting expenses. The goals keep getting higher and higher each year and the bonuses are getting smaller and smaller
good,"Wells Fargo is a large company, however the most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to volunteer and give back to the community."
good,As with most Loan Officer positions there is quite a bit of freedom with schedule and responsibility to create your own business. Most companies provide quite a bit of support and a clear ladder of advancement. Wells Fargo as a company seemed to treat the mortgage offices in New England as if they operated outside the company map providing little support in marketing and overall business structure. Direct management was disengaged and often openly showed signs of mistrust in the company and lack of faith for job security.
good,"Fast paced call center, a strong team has developed but because of WF inability to compete and give out decent incentives there is a high employee turn over rate.  Very hard to advance into another department, many corporate guidelines, ever changing workplace environment."
good,"Wells Fargo is a bank that focuses on making money 1st, 2nd & 3rd."
good,"The hardest part of the job is getting the hang of it. I want to be able to completely satisfy all of my customer's. I give them exceptional customer service! "
good,"When I was hired on at Wells Fargo I was told it was part time. After a few weeks I was scheduled full time and asked multiple times for my hours to be cut. It was hard for me to work full time while attending a University.The sales requirements were extremely high, especially for a teller. I enjoyed getting to talk to new and old customers throughout the day but the overall experience of the company was not as enjoyable."
good,Good company but very stressful overall review is learned  a lot about mortgage loans and liens  co workers  I have a best friend at work trying to advance monthly incentive and monthly recognition
good,Each day thta I arrive to work I look forward to learning something new an dhelping others learn something new also.  I work with a group of good people.  The hardest part of the job is when I am giving the best job I can and I am missing some inportant information from a file.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the teamwork thta we give to each other.
good,Typical Day evolves  60 to 100 inbound calls from current credit card customers. You will be required to service the call and position other bank products on a strict time table. Most enjoyable part of the job is to work with friendly people in a comfortable environment. Great benefits package.
good,"Generated credit reports on delinquent accounts"
good,"Good spot for experienced FA.  Corporate culture is very click ish, managers do not do much for FA's."
good,I have learned a lot about the back end of mortgages. Prior to and post foreclosure. I have been well educated surrounding the mortgage & Home preservation of the world. The room for advancement was not as available as it should be in such a large company. The hardest part of my job was not being able to help customers that really needed to be help. There were cases that we were not able to save a home per guidelines and it was difficult to give that information to homeowners. I have enough confidence in my abilities to advance in any and every way possible.
good,"Wonderful coworkers with one of the most pleasant and friendly job cultures I have ever experienced! The work is not simple, but not overly challenging. If an employee applies themselves it can be greatly rewarding and challenging. "
good,Wells Fargo is a very detail oriented corporation where they are losing touch with the human part of situations.  The pay is industry standard and there is a lot demanded from the employees.  Sales pressure is quite strong.
good,"Aggressive Environment"
good,A typical day includes building customer relationships by exceeding service expectations while using financial education to cross sell products based on individualized needs as well as assisting team members in achieving solutions based goals.
good,I enjoy the people I work with and the variety of situations I encounter each day and am able to service internal employees in regards to business policy/procedure and system navigation.  What I desire more is the ability for followup and a continual ongoing relationship with customers and more opportunity for advancement with relation closer to my passion in life dealing with the construction/real estate industry.  I have learned alot being part of a great team at Wells Fargo and very secure 9 to 5 type job.  Im looking for growth and a little more demand and challenges as a proceed to the next phase in my career growth.
good,It's all about WHO you work for with this company. Various levels of mgmt can be fair while others not so much. Go with your gut feeling on how you feel about the hiring mgr and their mgmt style.
good,I am best at customer service and helping others. I am looking for employment closer to my home in Andover.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Management is under a lot of pressure and it get passed down to team members.. Extremely sales oriented.Hitting numbers is prioritized over well-being of customers.
good,"Good PTO, health benefits are ok, match 401k. Company does profit sharing and offers a lot of other benefits."
good,Helping people with the dream of home ownership and also helping clients in our current portfolio with refinances.
good,Assisted customers with loan modifications and collected payments.
good,Wells Fargo is an organization that has a wealth of potential for growth and development for employees at all levels.
good,"A typical day at work involved speaking with roughly 50-80 clients and assisting them with their concerns or issues. Researching more complicated requests and following up with clients. There is a high standard for sales and top performance. While the Management falls short in advancement or development of it's associates, the co-workers develop a lasting relationship and strive to help one another succeed. The hardest part of the job was the lack of advancement opportunity, however the people you work with daily and the benefits plans helped increase the ability to face the challenge."
good,The work ethic of this company is horrible!! You have to be young and have no kids. SALES SALES SALES that is all they care about. The only good thing is the benefits.
good,ok work environment.  The pay was up and down. The office was in a good location.
good,"QA testing various software and learning about bank process and how money transfer works (e.g. Swift, Fed-wire, etc). Collaborated with teams in other parts of the country. Learned how to work with co-workers abroad and how to manage work/life schedule due to time difference."
good,Great entry level company for a person out of college. Top notch training but a lot of micro managing and promotions are not consistent.
good,"Login in to the computer, manage my pipeline and see appointments.  The training in the office is very poor.  Management very poor no return calls.  Co-worker are nice people.  The hardest part of my job is getting management on the phone"
good,No management for the group I work for.  My current position has so much potential to be a very satisfying job if I only knew the performance goals that I am expected to achieve.
good,"After taking some time away from mortgage, this was a good place to get my feet wet again after all of the changes. The things you have to do in order to get a loan approved though are much tougher than anywhere else (extremely conservative underwriting)."
good,I was one of the top performers yet was laid off once the volume of refinances slowed. Had absolutely nothing to do with productivity or performance and only on earnings level. Most of the layoffs were toward higher earning team members. The weaker performers and lower wage earners were retained.
good,This is a company that promotes within however it seems more about networking verses performance.
good,"mgmt pushing for production, UW 5 to 6 loans a day. Underwriting of initial decision and re cons. Learned company tools, investor guidelines, income calc for self emp borrowers. "
good,"The department I worked for was in Management Chaos, most employee did not stay any longer then a year."
good,Fun working with co-worker.  Learn how to deal with irrate people/customers.  Most managers micro-manage their staff.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Assist with compiling statistical reports, other special project, and training.  Handles most complex collections inquires and issues. Follow State and Federal regulations governing collections practices."
good,I liked working at Wells Fargo until I had medical issues in April in May that have now been fixed. I was talked to about using PTO for this.
good,"Wells Fargo is a company that truly strives to develop its employees and recognizes proven results with promotions and salary increases. However, you will definitely have to put your personal life on the back-burner as you bust your butt to generate revenue for this company. If you love to work hard and are a competitive individual, then you will love working at Wells Fargo. The good thing about this company is that if you are not happy in your current job function, management will work with you to find a better fit for your situation. However, that goes without saying that there is an incredibly high amount of turnover within the company's front-line staff. People eventually get burnt out from the work-hard-no-play culture that is encouraged by management."
good,The most rewarding part of the job is helping customers.  The worst part of the job is management and working with a group that does not care about you as a person.
good,"Good amount of work to complete."
good,"This job started off great! ended tragically, being laid off."
good,I left before Wachovia became Wells Fargo. Too much sales pressure to meet goals. Didn't like the micro management but I was happy while i was there.
good,"Was busy, productive and place to work with room to move up and grow. learned more about time management, enjoyed my co-workers as we all completed training together before moving into the job position. The hardest part of the job was not being able to please everyone all of the times and completely solving 100% of the issues. A typical day included the inbound calls problem solving. Refunds with approval from the supervisor on duty, Transferring calls to other departments if my services are not required."
good,"For the most part, the people I worked with were great - however some were a little young and immature. I'm young also, but I choose not to show it at work! "
good,"As part of the attempt for Wachovia to expand westward from the East Coast, the culture of the company was overwhelmed.  Questions on policies and procedures went unanswered, and management was ineffectual.  "
good,"30 days after getting out of training, I was put on a warning because of my stats. It had nothing to do with schedule adherence or anything like that. I was told this is ""normal"" and ""everyone gets a warning at this point"". That doesn't seem normal to me and is actually pretty stupid to give everyone warnings 30 days out of training because their stats aren't up to par yet. Ever since then, I was kept on warnings because of stats. I was unable to collect enough money which I feel is because of the way the economy is. "
good,"This company doesn't provide much insight on what you need to know on how to do your job. They only focus on people to do their job rather than knowing what , why, or how to do it. I dont see much advancement in the work place. Instead of promoting current workers, they instead hire new managers from schools who have no experience. Shame."
good,In a typical day at work we would balance about 100 - 200 customers accounts.
good,Opening of buisness included counting incoming cash shipment/Prepare outgoing cash shipment. ATM deposit pulls and breifing of sales goals. A typical day would consist of handling cash and check deposits and often times managing accounts. Its a great enviorment to develope professionalism and the ability to multitask. My co workers were awesome. I really believe thats what made the job tolerable. Lack of staff and unrealistic sales expectations created a stressful work enviorment. Not having sufficent staff effected service. The harest part of my work experience while at the bank was scheaduling. Part time hours were based on store needs. The pay was not sufficent enough and the scheaduling was almost was impossible to work around.
good,"A typical day included calling my vendors for status checks on projects, conference calls, traveling to all my sites."
good,The hardest part of this job is dealing with management. Don't wanna say to much still work there.
good,Good work place some nice people but im not the one to just sit at a desk for 8 plus hours on the phone non stop just not me
good,"employee are not valued, safety of associates is not considered"
good,"A typical day involves opeing accounts, closing account, account maintanance, assisting customers with an issue or concern that they may have. As a personal banker I would help the teller team reach their sales goals as well as myself by engaging the customers in conversations and asking open ended questions to uncover the customers needs. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,A day at work is hell you are hammered by customers that complain about every thing in the bank and when A customer ask for a fee to be forgive they say no and could not care about the customer. In addition the bank cares nothing for the employees. In a nut shell if you like to not be about work there other wise stay away fair warning
good,Very fast pase job. Very good company.
good,"Great co-workers, management lacking. Not as many areas of advancement as they claim. Some customer calls very hard to handle and not many supervisors available to help;."
good,My department is a great place to work. We always have competitions games to make our days more enjoyable. We also work very hard but we have fun along the way!
good,"I worked there as a contractor through Randstad. The majority of my work was due to systemic problems in the loan ordering process that took months to fix, at which point i and several other contractors were laid off due to low inventory."
good,Was very difficult to go from wachovia to wells fargo. Management is all about sales and more sales. Co workers are the only decent part of the job. Hardest part of job is to never be appreciated. Most enjoyable part of the job is the paid time off if you can get your manager to approve it.
good,Responsible for providing single point of contact to borrowers whose loans are delinquent or at
good,The hardest part of the job is the inconsistent communication between site locations related to call quality assurance.
good,"highly sales oriented, numbers focused environment. high turnover and not a ton of training. great place for self motivated sales people."
good,"Typical day at work, come in, sign into the computer, review emails if any. review your #'s, open your work station and you have to meet the 60 loans a day. The setting is typically quiet, very boring, and mostly confusing."
good,8-5 with lunch and daily team huddles with a fast pace work setting
good,refinanced homes
good,"I worked for WF for nearly six years while earning my masters degree. The pay is what I would call ""low competitive,"" meaning that they pay a bit less than the going rate, but fairly close. The benefits, including health insurance, are wonderful."
good,"a typical day at work consists of paperwork, organization, interacting with customers, fixing problems, and making sure customers are happy with our services."
good,A great job to start out with. Good pay and benefits. A typical day you will deal with a couple hundred customers. Simple math skills is a must. Must have an attention to detail. Small mistakes can cost you. Overall a good job.
good,"Standard work week, very good coaching and training available, very high demands on sales goals, friendly environment, i enjoy working with the customers."
good,"I was employed with the company for fourteen years. At the beginning my attentions was to only stay maybe three years. The opportunity to learn so many things was so exciting to me. Management was open to employees ideas and concerns. Everyone was like family, we all probably saw one another more than we saw our own relatives. The hardest part of the job was being laid off from the company, I miss the job, co-workers, and the positive atmosphere."
good,I am used to working long hours however there was so much pressure that they frowned when you needed to take a PTO or even a holiday 3 day weekend. People were crying in the restrooms or outside because there was so much work to be done and not enough training or management to go to for questions. I was adamant when I started that I wanted a balance in my life. I wanted to be able to exercise and take lunch hours when necessary. Sometimes it was frowned upon. We were constantly given files that were not complete which slowed down the quota we had to make.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Manager was rude, harassed the women. My csm was very nice, I use her as a reference to this day. The culture there is, the lower you are on the totem pole the more insignificant your opinion and ideas are."
good,Answer phone calls and help customers
good,"The position advertised exception authority, mentoring and coaching. I accepted the offer 30 days prior to my start date yet on day 1 I had no computer (told that it would take 2-3 weeks to get one). The job description also advertised world class training but by day 3 I had my 1st file (with more files piling up on my desk) with very little training and without a computer to input data or review guidelines. Then I was told the position had no lending authority, exception authority, and there was no coaching. It was strictly quality review PERIOD. I quit by day 5 and returned to my previous employer (found out that I wasn't the 1st person to do so). Don't believe the job descriptions with this company."
good,"It was a good job, with timely raises and advancement based on work ethic, speed, and accuracy."
good,"Go to work and work at your desk with a computer, learned about how loans are handled and transferred and recorded, pretty good management, co-workers were fine, hardest part of the job is the constant change, the most enjoyable part is how simple and repetitive the job became and how it opened you to learning other parts of the job"
good,"I learnt to thrive in a new industry (Financial Services) that I was not trained in. I exceeded the required goals for me, was able to improve efficiency in my deliverables."
good,"A typical day at work with Wells Fargo as an accounting specialist was identifying items that were classified as exceptions on our Electronic Processing System. I was responsible for another phase of the Electronic Processing System which were the check pull requests that had a 24 SLA time in order to complete. I had to pull a check pull request log and research the checks or deposits that did not post. After this was completed, I had to respond on the data base for each check pull the resolution that I had researched. Following this, I was resposible to help with Virtual balancing which was to resolve out of balance transactions for our customers."
good,"Wells Fargo is an overall great company to work for. The benefits are by far the best benefits I've ever had. However, they care too much about getting sales and new customers that they do not care about keeping customers they already have. Definitely hard to work for someone you don't agree with."
good,Challenging ever changing work environment with many different functions and opportunities.
good,As a personal banker my job was to uncover financial needs and in return recommend Wells Fargo financial products.
good,Our entire call center was displaced! Heavy call volume all the time. Low pay.
good,Minimal training - aggressive sales approach. I did learn of many things that gave me a solid base for launching my early career upon doing my tasks at Wells. Solid overall bank if looking for one of the larger ones.
good,"Productivity very slow, Very hard working enviroment. I learned alot when the company was under wachovia bank this was before it merge to wells fargo and then there was a mass layoff. I learned loan processing and how to neigotate with customers on saving homes for customers benefit and to keep revenue for bank."
good,"Processed claims, accounts receivable, data entry, insurance precertification and verification, patient care and customer relations."
good,A typical day with Wells Fargo Surplus Lines was constant. I learned that filing taxes for Surplus Lines you need to be very organized in order to keep up with the deadlines required. I met alot of great people working at Wells Fargo. The hardest part of the job was getting the documentation I needed in a timely manner in order to file on time. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with. We worked hard but when we had time to take a break we enjoyed our time.
good,I worked on the phone taking calls from small business owners.
good,Provide customer service for an average of 100 calls per day while cross-selling products and services to customers and prospects. I learned how to be a creative problem solver and devolped listner. The hardest part about my job is not being able to satisfy all customesr request. The most ejoyable part of the job is being recoginzed for outstanding work performance.
good,"Worked for the SubPrime Unit. Initally their intention was to make good loans, then upper management set unattainable goals which required underwriters to look the other way and just close a loan to get the numbers up. The rest is history."
good,"A Typical day was to come into work pull a report of forclosed loans, audit junior and senior loan processors loans to make sure they were in compliance with government, and departmental regulations. I learned a lot of information pertaining to the dos and don'ts when it comes for forclosing on homes, how to implement strategies to avoid forclosing in error in turn mimizing possible litigation and reputable issues. Most of my co-workers were good team players. I quickly became a subject matter expert for my department as well as other supported areas of the bank as I am a fast and efficient learner. The hardest part of the job for me is the ever changing world of banking. You could come in one day and there is a process or procedure in place and the next day or the next week it changes. All in all I learned to adapt and remain positive. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is the in depth research. I love research, using critical thinking and resolving complex issues."
good,Was a great company to work for that valued customer service and its employees.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wachovia Bank was much more client focused. Wells Fargo is more centered on growing the bank versus client satisfaction. They appear not to care if clients leave in droves or they displace hundres of long-term quality employees. Although change is necessary to be profitable, it seems as though Wells Fargo will realize the mistakes they are making too late."
good,A typical day was full of routine with a high demand in sales. The company required a lot of scripting to all customers with a sales quote that needed to be met monthly.
good,management was very unprofessional and prejudice.
good,Cool to work at an iconic organization. There aren't a lot of opportunities to move up within company.
good,"After working in the banking industry for over 22 years (working with the same companies that have been acquired through other banks). I must say that while being an individual who easily adapts to the ever changing envrionment of banking acquisitions, I feel the need for a change."
good,"Great company, however management was very unorganized and unprofessional and it seem that they did not care about single parents child care issues all they cared about was me working not just my minimum of 8 hours but they wanted every one to work 10 to 12 hour works days"
good,Need improvement on compensation/job security and advancements areas. Managment in South Carolina Mortgage arena in vast need of revamping.
good,No matter what they say they are more interested in selling bank product to clients than actually helping clients with what they really need.
good,"In terms of the corporate culture as a whole the company is great. Training is not so great, you are sitting at a computer in a virtual class for weeks. Pay is extremely low, upward promotion takes a long time."
good,Pros: Good pay for customer service environment. Cons: Back to back calls from irate homeowners. Good place to work if you like a fast paced call center.
good,"I was hired by a manager I had previously worked with at World Savings to work on findings (and penalties) discovered by a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Audit."
good,Don't wish to speak of issues.  The managers I worked with were helpful and understanding of the issues that where going on with the company push for production.  Understand that the main issues were from upper management.
good,Morale is low and the call volume is always high. environment can be very stressful. customers are rude because wells fargo makes many errors. emotionally draining
good,"Organization did not provide enough diversity! Leaders had no idea of transformational leadership. Working in Iowa for minorities is bad enough, working for Wells Fargo was even worse. I still have PST. I was hired during a time awful things were done to the public, because everything was about a profit or bonuses,  I realized how much damage they had done to the  "
good,Policies/procedures makes process easier. There is a lack of leadership with the managers with morale being low. Unrealistic goals set that underwriter have no control over but held accountable for
good,"Culture changed with the lawsuit occurrences.  It was a wonderful job position for what I was hired for, but it changed after a few years of a focus of company legal protection pushed to phone centers for service versus the care and assistance we were allowed prior for my book of business and client needs."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo has many loan customers which gives great opportunity for exposure and learning. The pay compared to others in the industry seemed to lack, and the software used is antiquated."
good,My time at WF was ok. Our department hired a manager from a whole different department. He should've spent a few weeks doing our job before offering advice.  Your taught to do one thing only always told the next mo to do something different. To many changes and kissing butt. Enjoyed my peers though.
good,Very busy work environment at retail branches.  Workplace culture is different  at each branch.  Enjoy the flexibility and location of my branch location.  Currently have a great district manager.
good,Working 10 hour shifts puts you in a tough spot where it's really easy to slip on small things. Unfortunately Wells is so scared of the small things making another thing mistake that they'll fire you over them.
good,"its a small branch in Safeway , so not much in the branch , "
good,"Good staff, great people on lower levels, management above branch is unreasonable often. A lot of the issues with things before my time there effect how customers treat you."
good,"Most enjoyable part of my day is my team"
good,"I feel like we're required to do more work than previous employees and I don't feel like I'm being properly compensated for it. Now that consumer and ocs banking is conjoined, I feel like we deal with more work for not enough pay. And I don't feel appreciated for the hard work I put into my job. It's a very thanklessjob"
good,"It is good place to work on while the management does not care about employees's welfare. There are some new technologies used in the job, which can benefit future job search."
good,Management picks people they like to complete more projects and move up . It’s not based on how good your work is but who you are friends with. Your quality and production does not matter when moving up and I am looking for a change.
good,"They don't value their employees."
good,Flexible working environment. People who are with the company for long are not collaborative. Too many re-orgs. Not many opportunities to advance your career
good,"Pay is mediocre or low, I enjoy underwriting but no room or chance for advancement. Very difficult to get approved pto to enjoy time off with family & friends."
good,"I had heard excellent things about being a team member for Wells Fargo. I was eager and ready to work hard, prove what I could do, and make connections to begin my network. "
good,"I had a 4 x 10 sch. starting pay was decent. It was a call center like environment in Loss Mit. The monthly bonus potential was decent too. They matched my 401k quarterly too, so that was good"
good,I think working at a bank is a wonderful starting place to receive professional work experience and to learn how to deal with customers and  finances. There is room for advancement but the job postings are few and far between and everyone wants them. The benefits and PTO are really great. There are a lot of rules and procedures to follow which can be overwhelming and it is often hard to find a good work/life balance with the branches being open six days a week and schedules always changing.
good,"Feeling not appreciated was my main complaint at Wells Fargo.  They promote employee happiness to the public, but truth be known they care more for customers who are rude and demanding more than their employees. Incentives each year changed so that the majority of employees were not able to achieve them. "
good,"Wells was an okay company, good technology, some decent benefits, especially the 401K match. I enjoyed banking with them as well, because their technology made it easy."
good,"Half the time, if we were open for 8 hours, I would only have something to do for 3 of those hours. Without customers, there is such a limited amount of work you can do. It is unbelievably stifling. That was my particular branch. Most branches are so understaffed, and have such a low retention rate, that the tellers don't even get a chance to breathe."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The issue with this employer is the toxic work environment. Great for temporary employment satisfaction, GREAT benefits, great people, but management makes it hard to be human"
good,"The job is as fun as your team makes it. You will learn a lot about how financial institutions work and you will interact with hundreds of customers a day, but your coworkers and management are what will make it either a fun or terrible place to work."
good,"The pay is good, the work environment at my particular location isn't the greatest. Employees with seniority tend to bully/walk all over the newer employees. Great place to start career in financial industry. my location is very busy. ive learned a lot from my manager, he is very knowledgeable and wants the best for his employees. very understanding of the fact that we have lives outside of work. hardest part is learning all the policies and procedures."
good,"Not enough support and too many different managers and lack of training."
good,"This work is in an Inbound phone center, a cubicle farm wrapped in Brutalist Architecture. The job is hard, it's chaos cubed. If you like order or quiet, this is not for you. Lots of weird computer programs which are a VERY STEEP learning curve. Everyone is nice, but the nice people just look at your performance via an algorithm. You are really working for a big computer with humans tending it. And you never know when the next scandal will hit. Mostly a matter of ""when"" not ""if."" But the pay is good and they keep the building climate controlled. Parking is close. Fairly secure campus. If you can hack it, go for it. If you can't, don't worry they hire by the dozens and keep the 1 or 2% that survive."
good,I was a contractor so was placed at Wells Fargo by Randstad  and my benefits and contract terms were different than a full time employee would be. I found the company to be working to improve its reputation.
good,"The managment is strictly based if your good friends with the managers or not. If you dont become good friends with the managers, you dont have a lot of room to advance."
good,"Wells Fargo has been through a lot of scrutiny. At this time there is a new CEO and WF is still under a government consent order. There is no real direction on where the company is going at this time, i.e. more sales, less sales, more incentive compensation packages, etc..."
good,good benefits and hours. only trained bankers how to sell accounts. not how to actually do all the other stuff. telemarketing required. daily sales goals. micromanaged. basically given a script. if you value your autonomy this isn't for you.
good,It doesn't encourage young talents although it says so but some teams are really so good. Management promises to take actions but no action is taken until now.
good,"This review is pretty moot, as the division I was in is no longer in existence, and all managers I worked with are no longer with the company. But it was definitely just a job, not a career."
good,"I survived 2 displacements due to mergers, unfortunately I did not survive the last displacement. Job security is very important to me. The management was very supportive."
good,"Worked there before their lawsuit changed corporate directives around sales."
good,"competitive workplace, not as friendly. There's a clear separation between the ops and the rank and file. Work wasn't as difficult. No incentives on some of the departments"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is making a lot of friends. All team members were willing to help one another."
good,The Houston location at the time was very small and in the process of developing their procedures to incorporate with the bank guidelines.  My day consisted of taking over for prior employees that were overwhelmed and fell behind.  So most days I had to research what was or was not completed.  Strategize on ways to complete the task.  Reach out to underwriters to get supporting documents and make sure the accounts were renewed.
good,"Mid-level management priorities were not consistent, and often changed based on personal opinions. Mid-level management made unfulfilled promises and often did not live by the diversity and inclusion messages of the organization. Often people were overlooked for promotions, and as a result in my low-level managerial role turn over was a problem, that mid/senior-level management blamed on our ""lack of coaching"". Coaching was only given to roles such as bankers and branch managers, often forgetting about the service team unless the customer service scores were bad."
good,Yes the people was nice and kind the hardest part of the job was doing stuff by yourself when it need to be 2 people or more I learn about different people at the job everyday
good,"I got the job as a loan processor through a temp agency. Was fired without warning after a month, despite the fact I was making my own goals and relaxed management."
good,"Catch up on emails, 6-8 meetings per day, evening and weekend work.  Upper managers have state of the company meetings once a month, while first line managers meet once a week.  No shortage of work to do."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"NO ONE WORKING IN THE BANK SHOULD LIVE IN POVERTY,"
good,"Don’t ever accept a role that you know you are overqualified for to get your feet in the door at Wells Fargo, because it will hinder you from landing roles that you are actually qualified for."
good,"No the greatest place to work, no job security. They lay off a lot of people. I was looking forward to working with wellsfargo again but interview process when you apply for a job takes 3 or more month to even get an interview."
good,"Not much stability or steadiness."
good,"I found working as an east coast part of a team based on the west coast, the west coast being where the majority of the team sat, was an isolating situation with very little consideration given to the east coast part of the team."
good,My current project client manager is from Asia and not following any standard and egoistic and no coding standard never follow SDLC or agile methodology
good,"The mortgage division has issues with closing on time and underwriting turn times can lag those of competitors. Product offering is good however, and so are training opportunities."
good,"My experience so far in life has taken me to many locations and work cultures, but I have mostly seen all of them being process dependent and the work culture is very average"
good,Too many changes in management and too many scandals. Not enough pay for the position. Limited advancement potential. It's not what you know or how hard you work but who you know.
good,I currently do not have the motive to write a review for Wells Fargo. It’s an okay job. That’s it. No real incentives to working there. The atmosphere and your job life depends on who you work with and management; which changes from location to location.
good,"Some team members want to help change the culture in a positive way, some are dependent upon it staying the same.  Learning to navigate the culture can be challenging."
good,"currently low morale due to lack of leadership experience, and department disorganization, no employee appreciation budget, bound by internal processes that impact customer experience"
good,"Innovative, Consistent, Team player, team builder, process improvement champion, support diversity and inclusion, strategic thinker, Executive reporting and communication expert"
good,Contractor to Direct Hire within 6 months. High call and claim's volume. Doable with a strong self control to make a balanced work and home life. Average pay. Really good benefits. Overtime always optional and sometimes mandatory during busy seasons.
good,"Company demands are extreme. Must be met. "
good,"I loved my job but the upper management tend to hire candidates on the basis of friendships and not experience. Very rarely is promotion based on hard work and dedication.  The culture has truly changed when the change from Wachovia to Wells Fargo happened,"
good,"It was nice coming to work and getting right to work, not having  anyone hovering over you, But it was very isolated, spent most of my days at my desk."
good,"Beware of what an agency won’t tell you.   A long term contract can make a contractor take up to three weeks of unpaid time off to offset the cost of contractors.  Does your agency cover this time away?   Not likely.  "
good,Employees talked about being laid off more than five times in their career. No stability to build on. Management was average with both good people and those uninterested in development.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Educational I was in an internship with the Next Move Program. it is a program for young adults with disabilities. It taught us quite a bit in an office setting.
good,"I worked in various areas of Wells Fargo, even before when it was known as Norwest Banks.  During all that time, the various titles, managers and departments I found there is always good that comes with the bad and Wells Fargo departments are inconsistent with the company's mission.  "
good,Culture was horrible with quota and goals every hour. Now I hear it’s different with the changes have been made. Don’t know of any bankers still working the district
good,"I worked for a solid 3 years with Wells Fargo Bank and Wells Fargo Advisers before the overall culture changed. They have placed a lot of individuals at the wrong positions and are focusing on certain micro-management aspects, which as a result have limited team member growth."
good,You need to be in with the popular people or people with a title in order to matter. Hard to get a good schedule. Even after earning seniority you still get the short end of the stick.
good,work place is enjoyable to work at if management was organized. employee organization wasn't handled the best. i personally did more work than regularly demanded of me.
good,The company  is ok but the benefits are good. I have been afforded the opportunity to work in various capacities within the company.  I have gained a lot of knowledge and experience within mortgage.
good,"Each spring they hire a bunch of people making them think they will finally have a good job in the Springfield, IL area and once they have completed their United way campaign in the month of September they lay off a bunch of people because ""work is slow"". Work is slow every single winter there. They know that they are not going to be able to keep that many people as full time employees so they shouldn't be hiring them. They also discriminate against pregnant women."
good,Phone Banker is the worst Dept in the whole company. Wells Fargo customers are rude and disrespectful and you are expected to be take it. $15 ain’t enough for what you have to go through
good,Following procedures and protocol was always foremost.  We always offered great customer service.  We always looked for opportunities to deepen  the relationship with the customer.
good,"My department is more production based and yet the changes they are implementing is focused on adherence and conformance. This is not phone bank. They have also cut our overtime but offer ""additional hours"" at regular pay."
good,The work environment itself was good but the constant changes made the company unorganized. Management also really needed improvement--there were many company biases amongst coworkers and managers and this made advancement within the company difficult.
good,"Overall, it's a decent place to work and I would work there again but many management changes have made it a very difficult place to work at times. It seems the lower level employees are doing most of the work."
good,"If your lucky you get a good manager that understands and listens and hopefully you get a raise. I’m bilingual, a merchant teller and was fast and never got a raise. They hired two new girls that worked the fast food industry and got payed more. Didn’t care for the company afterwards."
good,"This is a good company with good company. You get out of it what you put in like any other company. Facing a lot of challenges lately, but repairing a broken foundation."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company , I enjoyed most of my coworkers. Management was a whole different ball game. some managers were rude and always on your back about policy and if your not doing something right then they were going to call HR which effects how you get quarterly bonuses. While some managers actually took time to recognize there employees.  So in other words working for Wells Fargo was a stressful place to work, especially full time ."
good,"Wells Fargo has had it's ups and downs"
good,"Clicky group, a virtual group of young untenured people drinking the cool aid, no intra company networking outside of the call enter role, cause tbey are all lifers"
good,Outside of really no room for advancement the people you work with are great. I know a lot of stressful situations could be less if proper communication was established.
good,"High paced role on the trading floor was challenging and satisfying."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo lost its reputation with the fraud issues exposed in 2016  so  the organizational climate turned in a guilty culture environment and a absurd persecution to employees .
good,"My day started and ended as scheduled. I enjoyed working on the team I worked on, my manager was very open and honest about expectations of my job requirements."
good,"Too much pressure on Sales.  Unethical sales. I don't mind working overtime, I  don't mind coming in early or working late.  I don't mind working on weekends. I never performed unethically but still met and exceeded  my goals quarter after quarter for 4 and a half years as a Personal Banker.  Then I moved to the Mortgage Department where I exceeded my goals or over 2 and 1/2 years. , Then a Teller. "
good,"It was apparent that the manager at the time I was employed during 2014 was a tyrant and expected everyone to jump to the beat of her drum.  She was not well liked and she was also a person that enjoyed power and control over others.  She was by far not a servant leader. "
good,"Management sucks"
good,My job was eliminated due to the Market crash.  I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with.  I was very sad to leave my position.  I made good money.
good,Typical day is answering alot of emails and being on a lot of management emails about loan status.  Lot of micromanaging. Everyone is always worried about lay offs. They lay people off and then hire for cheaper. I enjoyed working with my coworkers.
good,"My department was shut down when the CFPB took over mortgage lending regulations, so I lost my job, but received a severance package that allowed me to look for a new job and not have to stress about finances.  Wells Fargo offers 401k matching, which was the best part of the job."
good,"Wells Fargo does its best to make up for the fact that it only cares about its shareholders, not its customers. It's a greedy, huge corporation and they are terribly unorganized. I came back from a leave of absence and it took them three months to get me back into my systems. Perhaps they wouldn't have to be so intent on micromanaging their employees if they took care of some of these money hemorrhaging inefficiencies."
good,"It was a cluster mess when I worked there.  Unreasonable expectations, poor management, depressing work environment.  Hated it.  Mt Branch manager was well known to be very unprepared to manage.  Did not know software.  More worried about his hair and how he looked to mgmnt then to support his LOs"
good,I feel like the company is great. Like all companies there is room to grow. I really enjoyed everything that I have learned with Wells Fargo.. Great company.
good,"Temporary position while I completed college full time. I worked as a copy write assistant, with mortgage letters for the HARP programs at the Minneapolis campus."
good,"Communication lacks"
good,"Wells Fargo has been in quite a bit of trouble lately, each and every time a customer gets upset they make sure you know about it. The hardest part is all the fees that are loaded on the customers accounts. It is exhausting and I felt it was embarrassing stating why they where getting charged and what fee was which. "
good,Great pay and benefits but laid off multiple times in five years. Hard to feel comfortable when you are always wondering if a lay-off is coming. Reports manage workflow and managers seem to spend all day in meetings talking about reports.
good,"The company is a pillar in the banking sector. However, the age of tellers and credit card conversions is dying. Mobile services and bespoke experiences are what customers look for, but WF finds it very difficult to make the changes needed to arrive there. Add accessibility compliance to that need, and it creates an environment of ambiguity, partially completed thoughts, and poor execution. When new talent is brought in, there are so many that are there from the Old Guard that insist on preventing them from passing new ideas forward, which inevitably pushes all that talent out. In my short time here, I've watched so many talented people leave due to this exact topic, and I hope in Wells' future, they'll find management that can support new ideas."
good,"Work environment is ok, a lot of the individuals don't speak or talk to you but will stare at you. Management and Leads barely help, aren't approachable and sometimes give a yes or no answer only when you're answered. Very hard to work in such environment."
good,"Typical day at work is engaging with clients and COI's who help drive business. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I’m grateful from what I’ve learned there and the people I’ve met but they need to do better with raises instead of giving everyone the same raise yearly.
good,"Lower than average Market compensation"
good,"As with any large institution, it's who you know and how long you've been at the bank that get you the farthest at Wells Fargo.  The newest team members get let go first.  Simple plan."
good,a good company to work for if you are just trying to live a steady life. the ambitious types should use there discretion wisely when deciding if this is the best company for you to work for
good,"Wells Fargo talked a great game around recruiting me. However, fell flat on its promises. I was given very little authority to make decisions on staff, process or training. They had seperate group that tracked performance points that really had little to do with the day to day of any auto servicing. I was handed the largest region in the West. It was ranked 13th when I arrived. The saying was how the West went so did the rest (due to its size). I was accused of tricking the numbers. I treid to explain that I had no idea wht the metrics were they had little interest in showing me. When I left the region was 5th."
good,"I worked for their student loan department from 2011 to 2013.  It was okay as far as working for the company, but the management there was horrible!. Too many politics."
good,"A lot of changes. No room for growth unless you're in good with the management team. Management could use some Managerial classes. But overall, for what it's worth, helping people, it's a good place to work."
good,This company is no longer in existence.  I worked for Wells Fargo Financial.  They eliminated this portion of the company years ago.  No need to review.
good,"A typical day at work was very busy from the moment we opened the doors. I worked in a busy town with a lot of customers. i enjoyed working face to face with customers. I enjoy making customers feel comfortable with my service skills and knowledge. Dealing with difficult customers got a bit hard at times but I always found a way to make sure no customer left our building unsatisfied. Also, being bilingual contributed a lot to my job as a teller. I was able to help all spanish speaking customers with their needs as well."
good,"This company was very sales driven and encouraging when it came to selling yourself and the products and services they offered. I learned a lot and grew a lot with the time I spent there. But even with hard work, I wished the raises were a little higher and more competitive with the market at the time I was there."
good,"Long drive, the cafeteria closes early. The facilities are maintained. Leaving the area is difficult because of the heavy traffic and the limited access to the highways"
good,"It only takes one bad person to infect many others. This is not isolated to this company, but it happens here more frequently as management hires their friends, who then hire their friends and a group is developed, much like high school. Overall its a good company, and used to have a great culture. Best to be in the cool group if you work there. This means kissing rears constantly and saying yes to everything, even if it's not the right thing."
good,Lost a got of passionate good leaders for rather poor ones.Reorganization had a detrimental impact on overall strategy that derailed the organization.
good,"Makes or breaks your experience with this company, the lay-out of their expectations were amazing. I wish I would've came in in a different district I would still be with WF."
good,"If you endeavor to pursue a career in IT at Wells Fargo, don't.  They are downsizing and the situation is ""volatile"" at best.    If you are a developer, things are more positive, but production support, relationship management, etc, no go."
good,Management stands right behind you every minute of the day constantly telling you how to interact with customers. It makes the interaction unpleasant and sound scripted instead of having a genuine conversation. They will tell you to take your time but be the first ones to rush you. You never are doing anything correct there is ALWAYS something you can do better.
good,No room for advancement within this location. Wells will pay the people that have been loyal to the less money but will bring someone in with less experience for more money.
good,"Worked for a very short time (only 3 months).  The job function was not what I expected and I felt the role was rigid.  "
good,"This is a large company and downsizes can occur. They typically hire people through temp agencies with absolutely no guarantees. Even though you are a temp and just help, they will manage you as though you are Full Time and expect performance results. They treat Full Time Employment as a reward and something to be highly desired."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"company was under numerous litigation and suffering from poor PR...company is run defensively in threat of government fines and penalties, oversight is constant"
good,"During my time with Wells Fargo, I felt my manager was sincerely interested in helping me grow, however the more seasoned staff were somewhat distant and unhelpful."
good,A good temporary job No room for advancement even though it was promised during interview. Very good family feeling like employee setting but not as professional as expected
good,"The  Management team is always under pressure , numbers driven. Extremely high stress, fast paced, with very low moral."
good,"Management style is chaotic. Overtime hours are worked at the beginning of the week, but by the end of the week they've cut the hours to fit a 40 hour work week, therefore denying overtime.  There are too many managers and often managers coming to your desk asking you to do multiple things back to back. It seems the left doesn't know what the right hand is doing."
good,Good company didn't experience much in the time there. Nice work atmosphere and Co workers. Management did a great job helping with daily duties in the office.
good,Limited career advancement unless willing to relocate. Direct manager is great- would work for Wells Fargo in the future if given the opportunity in the field i received my bachelors degree in.
good,"All banks are like this though. This was an obviously toxic company as proved by all of the national media attention, but again all banks are like this."
good,Managment is horrible and has a lot of favoritism. If your kids are sick they don’t accept doctors excuses so they count the absence against your attendance
good,"We were hired to underwrite loans however once training was completed we were underwriting only 1 loan per week hence we all were laid off.  "
good,"When I first joined the company it was a vibrant place, where you felt appreciated. It has changed rapidly in the past two years and is in a bit of a disarray. Workers have been leaving rapidly, either being let go, retiring, and or resigning on their own. The current atmosphere within the office is a negative one as those who remain are wondering whether or not their positions are secure. Management is changing and not for the better. Sadly, people are being given roles they have no knowledge in, which has caused a great disruption and upset to the structure that once existed."
good,"I'd never recommend working at Wells Fargo to anyone. The company seems to be going under and there are new rules and regulations almost all the time."
good,"Wells Fargo isnt a bad place to work. The biggest problem that I have with the company is it's lack of job security. I have been laid off from Wells Fargo 3x and it is a trend that doesnt seem to have a solution for. Some of the people are good to work for/with and the culture can be fun, but the looming possibility that your job could end at any moment is just too stressful for the risk of working there. It's hard to find tenured people with the company because of the high attrition rate, which bleeds over into the culture and day to day work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping your customers and being able to make a difference."
good,"Generally, Wells is OK, but just OK.  IF you thrive in ambiguity, prosper under management that is quite good at creating a false sense of urgency, and can work in a virtual environment where you never meet your teammates in person, and are good at breaking in a new supervisor every 6 months on the average, you will probably go far!"
good,"Overall a good experience working for wells Fargo. As long as you do your work, stay in compliance, and have organization skills you will be ok. The dark side is the work life balance and wells fargo legal issues currently."
good,"The recent troubles experienced by WFC have had a real impact, and I do think there is a sincere effort internally to restructure the company to address those weaknesses.  This has made the employment status of many more at risk, and even many good people do not know how changes will impact their job.  "
good,Good place to work. Only objection is I had a great interview where the supervisor even stated they would be in contact. Then two days later I received a rejection notice.
good,Don't expect to stay in the same job very long. Left after 10 years as advancement from outside company's comes before internal. A lot of good employees leave then come back in order to advance.
good,The team I worked with was great except for unrealistic targets and poor manager support while the other banks in direct competition were thriving due to an open eye on currant market changes wells Fargo held on to old practice that slowly but surely put them from first place in auto lending too last and now they have had too change the way that they do business closing regional business centers in just about every state if they had more of an open ear to their sales managers in the field they would have remained on top and not had to close so many jobs they went through a masive inturnal downsize
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo is just fine as a company.  As many know, there have been some troubled times with the company, but overall the work environment is fine.  I don't particularly care for my direct manager, but for the most part because I am a trusted employee, I am left alone to do the work that I need to get done.  I would really appreciate the opportunity to work remotely, as what I do is on the computer and phone everyday.  I do not meet face to face with clients, so there is no need for me to go to an office."
good,"I worked as temp.  No job growth.  No security.  Job was data entry.  Everyone had one job.  No cross training.  It would have been better if they would have told the tempos, there were 5 of us, that we might be hired full time one day, but they didn't."
good,Wells Fargo culture is full of finger pointing and redundancy.  Lines of business are not focused on improving processes and minimizing risk but rather constantly defending the status quo.
good,"Its a job that will pay you the way the company dictates in a stale environment. "
good,"A lot has changes since Ive left Wells Fargo, and from what I understand, for the better. There used to be too much emphasis on sales and less on customer support. The management at my particular location was lacking ability to take feedback, and poor at communication"
good,"Known to underpay; If working as a contractor, have a back up plan..."
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work.I do not wish to furnish any additional information about this employer. The legal issues have created an environment of instability.
good,"I've enjoyed working at Wells for the times that I have.  I was hired as a Loan Document Specialist 4 in November of 2009 during the recession.  Was laid off, called back again and was eventually let go.  I've been trying since that time to get hired again but to no avail."
good,"Laid off 2x, no job security and management needs a lot of improvement. Been on news many times so that should say a lot about the company. Wouldn’t go back"
good,"While the job itself was fine, the management and overall teamwork was lacking. Those who worked harder and deserved pay raises never got compensated and those who wanted to advance to higher job positions were ignored. Managers would not work with school schedules and didn't take our well-being into consideration. We were a heavily busy location and we were understaffed for six months and nothing had been done to try and fix that. However there was still a lot of skills to learn at this job and it looks fantastic on resumes."
good,"I worked several different shifts, helping the customer and fellow team member is fun. Lot of expectations for very little pay. Comp plan and goals change all the time. Huge turn over,"
good,"Accuracy of loan documents over speed was expressed in internal communications and daily meetings, however, the company did not abide by this philosophy as the culture was production based and the sense of urgency was to get loan documents delivered no matter what."
good,It was an alright place would not want to work there again. The place was kind of depressing to be at sometimes and I did not appreciate the way I was treated towards the end
good,"It was ok, it was a temp job. I liked who I worked with but it was threw a temp agency. So the pay was less then everyones else. The  work place was very professional"
good,"I was not happy with my work experience over there. They have a good foundation of their culture but it is so hard to be implemented in reality. However, I cannot sat only bad things about the company. I was lucky to have one of the best and most ambitious branch managers who helped me a lot to learn and grow. It is a good company to start your career path but it pays so low that you can barely make your bills."
good,Lacked a coherent management structure. Did not provide clear and concise goals for bankers. Had very great benefits. Has a great work life balance and flexability.
good,"It was just  day to day same old everyday work place."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The benefits are great. Your advancement will depend on who your manager is at the time. There is quite a bit of office politics played in the company.
good,"Being such a huge company the upper management has no control over what each district manager does and since I worked in so many different districts and know how the company has a whole works and should be worked from the top down. In my experience, always talk to the people who currently work there."
good,"I felt that my time at Wells Fargo was an adequate, but not an amazing starting point for someone in software engineering. The support was decent, and the people were definitely intelligent, although the culture was very much nonexistent."
good,"My manager really made my experience poor during my time at Wells Fargo. I loved my customers and the work was easy but she didn't like me so I got terrible hours, no raise, no promotions, no training opportunities, and she was extremely condescending"
good,A typical work day entailed underwriting 5 loans. The hardest part of the job was having management in a different state which made it difficult to communicate with them. Hard to get hired full-time.
good,very stressful work environment.  management says one thing and does another.  Says its not about the number but then says what activities are you doing to increase the growth of the company. Makes it about the company and doesn't put employees first.
good,I worked with very nice people that were willing to help you with anything you needed. That included other co-workers from other departments as well as mine.
good,I worked in an office where the top producer was #2 in the country. Therefore he did not follow the guidelines set by the company. My manager said to follow what she wanted but I was told the same by the top producer. Not a very enjoyable atmosphere to work in. Also I believe that the associates who worked under me were taking monetary bribes to bend the rules.
good,"I work in the corporate offices vs. a branch. I don't work directly with customers. Overall, company has a great work-life balance program. However, there is a lack of strategy or guidance from my manager or his/her manager about the bank's overall goals and mission on how that can translate into what I do day-to-day."
good,"A good manager is hard to find in this company. But if you are lucky enough and find a good one, he/she will help you develop, if not its very hard to succeed"
good,"fast paced work environment"
good,"If you looking for a fast paced environment where numbers come first, Wells fargo is a great place to work. Great benefits, easy to take time off. It has it's pros and cons."
good,"While it is a large bank, too many HQ locations creates too many lack of alignment issues.  This gets in the way when decisions from the lowest quarters have to be made.  No one wants to own, or make simple decisions and so the red tape, bureaucracy and politics causes the simplest 'yes or no' to require 5 meetings. The benefits are great; Employee development is available, yet opportunities don't follow the training.  From a leadership role, we failed miserably in front line engagement and training.  Leadership forgot that the bulk of the business and employees were in the branches."
good,"Best benefits in the business.  Management is not supportive, teammates are competitive, job security is circumspect at least once a year.  Changes in management, production or business structure change often putting job security at risk."
good,the collections specialist position is very stressful but compensation and time off were great. I overall like working there and the staff was great!  b
good,"It was a decent place to work, when i started we where under a different bank. That changed and so did the culture, not for the better. Other then that it was a fine place to work."
good,help customer with services.   Account financial reviewed to help with recommendation to help customer succeed financially.  Learned to work with other department to help resolved complex issues.  Management has not change of making employee be themselves and help with career advancements. Push for bankers to do sales.  culture has not change and finding other ways to make more calls than ever. Most enjoyed part is the people that works in the retail bank.
good,"Wells Fargo continuously laid off and then did not consider the skills and the salary you may have had in the past with them when re-hiring.I worked in many different departments with Wells, from front line underwriting, to the start up of a conventional underwriting team, to HAMP loans, and the 2nd level review of HAMP loans."
good,Work environment could be much better. There doesn't seem to be much room for advancement within the company. I've applied to several different positions throughout the years that I'm qualified for with no luck.
good,"I made it an awesome experience, relocated from Arizona to Florida working through two mortgage cycles, benefiting from compensation years and stagnant years, overall an awesome time. If one is flexible and has the ability to transfer, most of the groups I've worked with have worked in multiple sites, which is a great opportunity to see the country and meet new people."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Enjoyed helping customers, but not many opportunities for advancement.Training when starting out is paid. Lot's of internal downsizing and layoffs currently."
good,"loved working at Wells Fargo, but stability of job was not secure."
good,don't work there anymore  more pay was less than avg  and management was on top of things Would not go back because of the Culture there.  And the computer underwriting system needed work when I was there
good,I was lucky to have a great manager. However I feel that the expectation for a new loan officer to succeed without a salary is erroneous. I followed the training manuals and sales guide to a 't' but it did not bring any income. There is no path for advancement as a loan officer here and ultimately the company is too big to care about their employees development. They will choose to let go of talented people instead of putting them in a new position.
good,WFB does not live up to its own standards. There is a disconnect from who the  C Suite puts out as a facade and the expectations within the workforce.
good,Turnover rate is high with the company but they have great benefits. The hours are flexible and you have the option to change shifts and work lots of overtime.
good,The company is going through a lot of change at the moment. Customer facing team member in the branches are paying for it the most. Hopefully there will be a new renewed focus on team members once the dust is settled.
good,My service manager was picky and never on your side. Branch manager was amazing and wanted to improve my position ASAP. Overall not a bad experience but it could have been better.
good,"I worked in the mortgage processing department, right after the real estate crash. The information that needed to be collected for new loan applications was crazy. "
good,"recently reinstated competitive sales goals that, if not met, are met with threats of termination at the expense of the integrity of the customer experience. Offer health insurance to part-time employees."
good,"Hard to stay focused when the company made news of corrupt business practice. Upper management struggled to focus on what was best for associates, instead worried about their money."
good,Layoffs of 130 plus associates in the past two years in the Irving location.  No recognition for good employees nor any discipline for ones that aren't performing to production standards.
good,Good job security and benefits.  management can be good or bad just depending on who you are aligned with.    Usually promotions are done by who you know not what you know
good,"The company and position could of been a great opportunity for me, unfortunately, during my time there I did not receive the best support from management . "
good,"poor management, no real direction to the company.  Pay is about the average in the industry.  You have freedom to work from home and/or the office with no micro managing."
good,"The branch specifically I worked at was slow paced and laced growth opportunities. I was able to handle my sales and was offered plenty of responsibility, but never offered opportunity for advancement."
good,Frequent layoffs make many employees constantly fear for their jobs. The office was very gossipy. The people working there were really great people under a lot of stress due to uncertainty that they were reminded of often.
good,It can be a very stagnant place to work. Growth is only achieved when you know the right people. A lot of jobs that are posted managers already know who they want.
good,"Branch manager is unqualified, the service manager basically ran the entire bank. Unwilling to work with personal matters / education. No advancement opportunities or training."
good,"This was my first job in the financial industry and they paid for me to get my securities license but they have major communication issues that is part of why the firms reputation is in the toilet. Doesn't pay as well as others, this company is cheap."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Benefits are good. People are nice. Not as much advancement as one would expect.  "
good,"Working here was neither good or bad. It was literally ""ehh."" The management was interesting. There seemed to be a lot of shadiness going on, and I personally wanted no parts of it. I like to come in, do my job, go home, and they didn't seem to like that. Why? I don't know. The pay was good for the work. However even though they stressed that they were not trying to reach certain sale goals, one day we didn't and we weren't threatened that we would be unemployed. So take that how you want to."
good,"It was not a great experience at all. Wells Fargo have this ""WOW, customer service. You always have to score 5 or else you would be in trouble. Meaning- losing your job. That was my experience way back 2012."
good,Working here you are expected to cut customers phone calls down and sell them products. Often mistakes were made on customer accounts by prior employees that would not take the time to fix the error. Human Resources is a cluster as normally they do not know what the other is doing and error on bucket allowances frequently.
good,Lack of flexibility when it comes to work/life balance. No sales goals make it extremely challenging to progress in your career and be promoted.  Lots of entry level personnel.
good,"Working retail is always stressful, and when you're dealing with peoples' money, the stress is increased significantly.  My experience differs wildly based on what branch I was working on at the time, but overall I think Wells Fargo was a fine place to start my career.  I learned a lot about money management, and got to meet a lot of interesting people.  However, I worked at Wells Fargo in the hay day of them opening up unnecessary accounts for clients, so I would assume the company culture has changed much for the better."
good,Ok place to work. Not employee friendly as to allowing working from home. Benefits are improving. Too much recent management changes creating future uncertainty
good,The job is very stressful and challenging. It has changed multiple times since I have been employed. Management is constantly changing. The best part of the job is my current manager and co-workers. The job is production based and it feels like you can't leave your desk to take a break.
good,"I started out as a Wachovia Employee, and I love the morals and values of Wachovia. When Wells Fargo took over the entire moral of the company changed. Wells Fargo could pay their employees more, and some members of management need leadership training. I was told that having my MBA didn't mean anything and the office that I had worked in I help build and everyone in my department that came in after years and months after myself was making a lot more than me and they didn't even have bachelors degrees. I decided to leave the company after 8 years because I felt that I couldn't grow, I really didn't want to leave, but so much was going on."
good,"Working at Wells Fargo is not a terrible job, the only issue I have is with management.  They stress customer service and yet they provide terrible customer service to the customers while the tellers are forced sometimes to fix the situations not the other way around."
good,"A personal banker is a representative of a financial institution who helps certain clients manage their assets, including mortgages, savings, checking and money market accounts, and Certificates of Deposit"
good,"My time with WF Merchant Services was very challenging. Montana is a small state with a lot of travel to get to WF banks and customers. My monthly goals for selling merchant services were the same as any big city in the US. I couldn't get them to realize that so without any compromise I had to quit or wait to be fired for not reaching my $4.5 million monthly goal, in only credit card sales done by businesses. I loved my job and my customers so I miss that."
good,Enjoyed my time working there as most people were friendly and helpful. Location was bright and clear and close to home. Location also near park and shopping.
good,The employees made the job great but management was very messy and talked about everyone there. In the beginning I had a awesome supervisor who wanted his team to succeed and then I ended up getting a supervisor that was all about themselves and kept up a lot of mess with her team.
good,Good place to work and benefits are good. There's  room for career advancement. 401 k and stock options are comparable with the market. Pto accrual is decent
good,"The are great benefits. But there desire to always hire within cause there to be a lot of people that aren't really the best fit, especially management. Also the attitude and work environment is very toxic. It is clear that they are trying to save money any way that they can so they don't hire more people when they should."
good,"was not satisfied with this company at all.  towards the  end, they hired about a total of 10-15 originators.  we had to each have a certain amount of closed loans within a 3 month period.  if you didn't meet the quota then you would be terminated.  which happened to me.  so there was about 1-15 loan originators working for wells fargo so that there was competition plus every other mortgage company and banks out there trying to hustle loans in a small city.  it was hard to meet quota.  they where all about numbers and how many employees they have versus focusing on the employees they had."
good,"Wells Fargo too many company layoffs, no job stability. the company does not pay competitive salaries with other companies pay scale for the same job experience."
good,"Every 3 months something changes dramatically within this company. Nothing is ever ""consistent"". Very hard to move up within the company. No matter how many roles or extra activities to add on your day, it goes unnoticed. Advancement is limited, only upon Branch Managers consent to apply for advancement. Lots of turnover.  Management is very ""micro-managing"", and very not empathetic, poor. Overall the benefits were very well. I do not think I will ever be involved with Wells Fargo retail departments."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I was hired to be a post commander but was sent to a old mine to watch a hole in the ground that was secured. i was then moved and given the rank of SGT. but did not give me the raise with it. later when i asked about it and my post commander job was told if i didnt like it get out.
good,"The location I am at has some very knowledgeable people, but there are also quite a few managers who do not have the job experience to lead. There is a big focus on micro managing but very little focus on actually delving into case studies to positively impact the business. No matter how much one accomplishes in a work day, the focus is what you didn't finish. "
good,I was fortunate to work with a great team and had the autonomy to work from home as needed. Pace was grueling at times and the challenges the company faced recently took their toll on everyone. Overall I recommend Wells Fargo.
good,I was very happy with my job but the company made some questionable choices regarding its business practices. They're in damage control now and started selling a lot of their properties resulting in locations closing.
good,"as you are aware wells fargo has been constantly sued, with no union, the fault ends up on the employees, even though we are told if we do not do enough we end up on certain 'reports'. it is no longer a quota, it is now called 'productivity' and while we have personal guidelines if a salesman pushes enough an exception will be made, and it will somehow be your fault that the loan was unable to close on time... which leads to you being on a 'report' and could lead to write up. there are good people here, and good managers but while the company states they are trying to do better, they rarely listen to the advice of actual employees."
good,"Working as a bank teller for WellsFargo was a brilliant way to start my transition into the professional, adult world. High customer service and presentation standards, along with the necessity of engaging, building relationships, and trust with customers. Consistent working hours with adequate incentives and upbeat people for the most part."
good,"This is a job or position that allows you to work with other team member in their development with the company and provides plenty of coaching opportunities for them. "
good,Happy to discuss in person. Not willing to write publicly and face consequences for sharing the true culture of Wells Fargo Bank and internal operations.
good,"Didn't care for my managers at the time, some seemed unacknowledged of there jobs. i didn't like being on phones as much. team member were nice. relax feeling on friday was nice."
good,Work is jam packed from the moment I walk into the door. The people are the most enjoyable day. Wells Fargo offers educational webinars to help employees understand different topics and many team member networks.
good,good on paper but not as good in person unless you have a specific job out of the customer market. Then it is much more fun and relaxing. If you work in a branch its not poor management skills plus poor and illegal business practices were going at the time. This is why i quit so soon after starting it only took a few months to see this was not a good place to work and could not bring my self to what the others were to get their bonuses so i quit of course with notice.
good,"In the face of what's currently going on with Wells Fargo - I feel management within the company should be more transparent, listen to their employees and understand their needs. Realize how important it is to keep teams fully staffed so others won't be overworked or 'burned out'. Management within the company should create a better atmosphere where communication between lines of business is key and transparency to ensure a better risk mitigation culture."
good,"With all the change in the financial services industry, Wells Fargo Advisors seems to struggle with the changes. Morale at the mid-to-lower level seems low."
good,"Very nice people, very disorganized program. Very corrupt.  See Wells Fargo $1 Billion fine -"
good,"Ever since the company was caught for illegal account openings, the business has slowed down tremendously. You can't just talk to people without your supervisor giving you a script to make sure you don't get them in more trouble. Very little empowerment or opportunities for growth. The Winter Park location is amongst the worst branches of all."
good,"I learned a great deal about processing and origination of loans. This experience has been invaluable in a great command  federal and state mortgage regulations loan documentation and the ability to review documents from origination to closing. During my time at Wells Fargo I learned how to order and review insurance declarations pages, FHA case numbers, Floor certificates, title work, registration and tags for mobile homes, and loan closing documentation.  This was a very complex position which lead to a higher position as a Quality Assurance analyst for Wells Fargo"
good,"At first Wells Fargo was a great place to work, I always had fun and felt secure here. But after everything that has happened lately they are closing branching and letting people go."
good,Wells Fargo is a employee friendly work environment. Management is very helpful and positive. A typical day at work in an Agile environment is to meet daily and provide updates of the previous days work and provide updates on the current days work.
good,The company has a good focus on it's current vision and values but it is hard dealing with the constant reorganizations withing the company often with no advanced warning.
good,"Was hired as a wealth management LO, only to be unassigned to FAs. I went 6 months making cold calls from my old book of business. I was then promised a branch location which was never delivered. I ended up leaving to work for a broker. Overall it was a bad experience."
good,I worked here when they had sales goals and it was horrible! I felt as if I was scamming the customers into the idea of getting a product. The  managers were only focused on  sales and rarely the true interest of the customer.
good,Management needs to be more honest with employees and tell them the truth about how they operate.  Making more than management really does not work when review time comes up.
good,"Benefits are good: lots of PTO that increases with time served. Health insurance could be better: high deductible plans. Management tends to get hired in from other areas and doesn't have a drive to learn their new business units, leading to misunderstandings, extra work for people, frustration, and hard feelings."
good,"Did not enjoy the outrageous sales goals. forcing employees to falsely open and create account for customers was completely unethical, the reason I left."
good,"day - sucked"
good,"Management does not know the job that you are required to do, therefore they can not assist you in getting your job done properly."
good,there is no real room for advancement. The overall work environment in this department is ok. But the pay does is not what it should be for the position.
good,I didn't feel appreciated there but I worked with a great group of people. the goals and expectations required and set by management were often very unrealistic and it felt like you were being set up to fail. I loved so much everyone I worked with though. Hard working bunch. I just felt it was unstable with layoffs.
good,We had to work at a  fast paced. We had to be accurate and precise .I learned how to get along with people of many different ethics and religions.I liked my coworkers .We had a good time when we got together.
good,So my review wouldn't actually be fair as I was a contractor that was there for only 3 months.  During my time there was supervisor wasn't the friendliest.
good,"When i worked for Wells Fargo the pressure to sell products was at an all time high. The script required us to become robot-like and "
good,"The atmosphere here is sale, sale, sale whether the customer needs it or not. Wells Fargo is focused on getting as many products to the customer as they can. The don't evaluate solely on customers needs. I loved interacting with the customers to help them with their financial needs. The downfall to that is, it comes with so many stipulations that you sometimes can help them as you should. Bonuses are based on the amount of products sold to the customers"
good,"I worked as a driver for Wells Fargo loomis, they start off at 11 and hr but your overtime is only 13.50 because they go by minimum wage and not by your hourly wage."
good,"I don't have much of a review to leave considering I was only at this assignment for 6 months. Aside from the culture itself being a bit different, I have no other words to leave."
good,"Wells Fargo is a good company to work for. Due to recent events that landed them in the new has taken a toll on some lines of business. I no longer want to be a part of the reputation of Big Bank."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Well Fargo afforded me the ability to training and advance during my tenure. The most enjoyable part of my job was the ability to set my own schedule and hours.  There were times when your on call at all hours due to nature of position.  Wells Fargo does need to improve work life balance because while they talk about it a lot it is very hard to achieve based on job expectations.
good,"The work environment is not horrible, the management is beyond inconsistent and constantly revolving (unique to my particular location) and there are unrealistic expectations set before you for the manner in which you complete task that do not allow you to be customer oriented. I would recommend WF to anyone applying to any location other than mine. The benefits and PTO is unmatched by any non-government job."
good,"I was part of a team and specialized in bringing in large wealth management clients as well as commercial lending and investment banking through NYC - huge organization and not entrepreneurial"
good,Wells Fargo can be a great place to work or terrible - It all hinges on who is one's direct manager.  I had managers who were nurturing and caring while the last real manager I had was a bully.  A woman who said and did hurtful things and later lied about it all.  Worse was how her managers protected here even though she was not good at her job.
good,"This is a great company to work with. I was unfortunately assigned to a manager that did not fit well. At the time, mortgage criterias where changing and a lot of interest rates going up. I ended up helping current bankers with mortgage loans understand the cause of their loan interest increase which did not help in my personal production, Plus the fullfilment center was too slow to process a loan at that time."
good,I start work at 8 AM and leave a 4:30 PM.  I pull title loans from a list  review and try to outflow if possible or correct the title problems. The hardest part of this job is correctly reading the title for vesting purposes. The most enjoyable part is accomplishing all I want to in the day.
good,"strong company, tough in the mortgage sector. Be prepared to work all the time, and make the quota or you'll get let go. They need to keep the numbers up."
good,Was a good place to work for many years. Like all large companies opinions vary depending on where and who you worked for on an individual level.  But over -all a great company.
good,"It was an easy job, I enjoyed working independently. They allowed us to listen to music. Management was okay, I overall enjoyed working there. They shift wasn't great."
good,It was a very stressful job most of the time when it came to making our numbers. We didn’t get paid enough for all we went through. The annually raise was nothing compared to other places.
good,"The company's workplace culture is currently changing, so it is difficult to write a review based on working at Wells Fargo today.  I trust the changes will put the company in a better place amongst it's competitors."
good,"When there is time, there are great resources are you to learn from. However, upper management does a poor job supporting development and truly providing a conducive environment for a particular employee to focus on their job's specific role and goals."
good,"Be fair to all team members."
good,"the bank is a good work place because you learn about financial stability for your own personal lives. work environment is ok in regards to helping client Wells has come a long way from what they got in trouble for. I believe that upper management have to learn how to actually help bankers and tellers, because it almost seems like they are looking to catch something wrong with how you talk to clients. they sit right next ton you and almost make it awkward to talk to the client."
good,"WF has been in the news a lot lately, and not in a good way.  Due to the employees having done wrong makes it a horrible place to work for those of is following the rules and processes.  Remaining employees are beraded with consistent new rules and crack downs nearly threatening our jobs on a daily basis.  I have been a loyal, high integrity employee for years and still feel like they watch every move just looking for a reason to terminate employment.  This is very stressful on a daily basis and quite frankly insulting.  "
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job, being able to assist customers with their financial needs, and going above and beyond to help them become financially stable."
good,Overall it was ok to work there.. Not as good as BofA however pay was on the higher end. I was apart of a massive layoff and was laid off while on disability.
good,"WF has recently been hit with several class actions lawsuits that have prompted an incredible amount of change for the best. However, these changes are not always the most well drawn out to benefit the customer base and team members at the same time. Even though the pay is fairly competitive and the overall culture has improved significantly, it doesn't make up for the constant roller coaster team members experience daily."
good,"Constant increase of daily goals with a commission structure that is capped.  They do not pay on monthly deposits like Chase Bank.  They also do not pay per loan as other banks do.  You can't make any real money until you get licensed for private banking, Financial Advisor, Mortgage or Commercial Lending."
good,A typical workday varies depending on department and management.  I learned that ther is a lot of talent recruited for WF but is more often under utilized due to poor management. The job was enjoyable due to its day to day challenges.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Not interested in reviewing. "
good,No  loyalty to years of service.  Cheat people out of service package for the years of service. Overworked staff at you in at every three months when statements what do very stressful job
good,"It was a pressure cooker starting everyday with cold calls to Wells Fargo subsidiaries, which included hearing NO more than one would like. I was able to pick up fast and developed a presence over the phone that lead to more sales more customers and more seeing how if I was independent from WELLS doing the same thing I would have seen 10% of my deals to the tune of $374,000. If that wasn't discovered sooner than the Market Crash I would most definitely still be in the Loan Officer business."
good,"Office Clerk and Sales Associate with office operations experience and Customer Service expertise seeking to change professional fields and return to a full time, entry to mid-level position with the opportunity for upward growth."
good,I really never liked working here a whole lot. I had some opportunity to advance but was rejected. I was involved in as much as my boss would allow. I didn’t really jive well with my supervisor. It’s a good job if you can handle lots of call flow. If not don’t even apply.
good,"was super corporate, no one had a name, instead you were employee # 1312234"
good,Moving within the company can be very challenging. The culture in the beginning of the merger between Wachovia and Wells was very strenuous. I has gotten better but it still needs work.
good,There are too many meetings that people are required to attend even though they do not have any input to provide. Poor time management during the meetings is also a major problem. Meetings often go over their allocated time. Meeting agendas are sometimes hijacked to deal with an issue that concerns only a handful of people.
good,I have some fun coworkers however i had to leave because they weren't able to respect my hours as a student. I enjoyed learning the teller line and how to interact with customers.  Because we were so short of staff at my branch i felt that i was not taught properly on how to do things since this was my first teller position.
good,"It was a all center environment, but with less micromanagement than other call centers I have worked in before. Incentives for bonus were often unrealistic and the job was not described as a sales job, but as a customer service position. That was not at all accurate. It was a sales job with sales incentives and goals."
good,The culture of this organization has changed significantly over the last 5 years for the worst.  I hope they hire people who can turn it around. Management does not seem to have a vested interest in developing its employees.  Very cut throat sales culture.
good,Wish they would give the option for a contract to hire not just a contract. The hours are consistent and the managers are understanding when you are sick.
good,"Loved the enthusiasm of the managers, did not like pushing services and fees on people who didn't understand what they were. Great training program, good benefits."
good,"I worked in IT and became the 'maytag repairman' fixed a super important system then got nothing more to do. "
good,Enjoyed doing negotiations and assisting homeowners and realtors to approved short sale transactions in various portfolio's.  Work culture was stressful and there was a lack of advancement in positions.  Applied for numerous promotions and was rejected.
good,"It was a good place to work as long as you did your job.  The employees computer terminal tracked key strokes., and idle times. It was possible for management to track breaks and non productive time.  This was actually good for me because I worked, and was rewarded for my work."
good,"Lots of restructuring every two years. Be prepared to get laid off in years time."
good,"Overall a good company to work for. I learned to be save about financial services for example loans, checking and savings accounts, CD's and was able to understand how to financially succeed."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work and play, but the last contract was a terrible contract. The management was poor. The hours that were required many and that information was not disclosed when the project was started."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"This was prior to the Sales revelation, Sales goals were fairly unrealistic for the volume the branch saw. Management was well meaning, but had a hard time staying reasonable with the goals they were forced to enforce."
good,"Working at Wells Fargo Bank was a mixed bag.,I learned many new systems, procedures and skills and worked with some wonderful people, however very little.room for advancement. With the emphases on having a diverse culture, and network of nepotism throughout the internal department,management practice's, had the ""good old boy flavor"" which made it difficult to have a voice. "
good,"Wells Fargo was a great company to work for. The only thing missing was the fair pay. They did not pay enough to be a big company within Saint Louis. If the pay was more, I would have stayed."
good,The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the work schedule. There's not much flexibility in your schedule if you're new. You have to wait for a specific amount of time or until a shift bid comes up. Incentives are excellent but only if you get them. The metrics are hard to achieve but it is possible.
good,"If you work hard, do not mingle with the high school bs.. you will do amazing here. "
good,This position is low paying and high turnover. The call volume is very high with back to back calls. The job role has changed a lot and has taken away responsibilities from the specialist which used to add value to a resume. The job is moving towards a high pipeline no responsibilities job. They took away the bonus.
good,Wells Fargo has a good workplace culture The in-house training courses are good. Days are stressful at times when there are big releases in the pipeline.
good,The teammates were a pleasure to work with.  We were like a family and took care of each other and watched out for each others backs if something was to wrong.
good,Wells fargo was a good place to work for. Very relaxing and I liked the manager there she was very helpful and always worked at building people strength. She set the right example for the team members to follow
good,"a typical day at work for me is asking the supervisor or persons involved with the next job assignment what are wee working on. I learned that every project has a SLA which is a deadline for the jobs due. management over my whole job area  recently has been uncommunicative , barely reachable and very unreliable for me . very good culture I guess for now. the hardest part of the job is making sure that the newest persons are getting things done on time and in the correct way. Mostly enjoyable part of my job is a few of my co-workers and my lead over my area always rewards the crew for hard work."
good,"I worked at Wells Fargo almost 2 years and while I felt at first that I was learning and developing my financial skills, it became apparent that upper management wanted to turn us into robots. Their QA team would nit pick employees of the way they worded their sentences to the point where it became difficult to establish a relationship with your own customers. While I did enjoy most of my team members and the management team directly above me, it was hard to not fall out of love with this company fairly quickly."
good,The position was good. But then without offering you a choice to move to the new location in another state they just hire new people that they have to retrain.
good,That was the worst company I worked for.  Bad management culture.  Seemed like they wanted to break people down and turn them into mindless minions in order to maintain a culture of cutthroat sales.  Wasn't necessary; and in the end their bad investment in World Savings brought them crashing down.
good,"I was involved in an incident that required me to make a employee complaint against housekeeping regarding restroom access.  When I made complaint initially, the housekeeping employee stated she was not disputing and that no complaint was necessary.  I then was called into meeting with management regarding incident and was place on administrative leave with pay for further review of the incident.  I was then wrongfully terminated for a complaint I originally submitted, claiming misconduct at work place.  Unemployment Agency made wrongful termination determination."
good,"Most days I worked vert high paced and accomplished most task assigned to me."
good,"Management was great, but the lack of improvement and compensation is poor. I didn't struggle to transition from a teller, CSSR and then Personal Banker. Sales goals were priority despite what you feel is more important for the customer, ex. not all individuals need nor want 5 credit cards, when they are not able to manage there daily income."
good,Fast paced driven company. loved working and helping customers understand banking. Enjoyed the people I worked with. They became like family since i was with them all the time.
good,"Many subcultures throughout company -- the groups I worked for are fast-paced and exciting.  Management is decent overall. In many parts of the company workers are seen as being ""sheep"" and aren't as driven to come up with innovative cross-enterprise solutions.  The company's rates and salaries are definitely not competitive."
good,"I left a few years after a hostile take over. I started with First Interstate Bank and Wells Fargo took them over. The clients and staff were good people, but the changing work environment was not  meshing well. I assume that has smoothed out over time."
good,"Was a great Bank to work but ever since change for the better, our brand has suffer and so has the quality of the employee. Putting the company first and your team members second"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Managers may be virtual and this can be difficult to work withl i.e., impossible to have face to face contact, develop relationship, etc.  Different work styles make it almost impossible to define and do your best"
good,"This job was a first job for myself, I thought it was great to get a well-rounded set of skills for future career opportunities. I worked for Wells Fargo when sales goals were a must, this made for a competitive environment which was pretty fun. The management however, was one of the toughest immature managers I've ever had to work under. I believe if this manager hadn't been my manager I would have lasted longer. They just made my experience a miserable one."
good,"I have been working at Wells for 8 years in several different positions.  While the positions advertise a broad range in salary, my experience is that the salaries are always much lower than the national and local average.  I feel Wells has a difficult time properly compensating in salary the value of the work that is given by the employees.  I feel while management follows protocol in having employees complete career development plans, the same management has a difficult time in assisting an employee to see that plan come to fruition."
good,Strong PMO . Culture is good. People are mostly friendly and cooperative. I worked remotely so I did not get to enjoy the company of my peers.Strong PMO . This was the hardest part of my job.
good,"This is a great company to work for if you are assertive with your skills and are confident in yourself. This is not a place to expect friendships from, although it's possible. They do provide great opportunities to improve your professional skills."
good,To undergo a 6 week training there is a lot of things you aren’t taught. You have to learn a lot of things just from being on the phone. They need to do some things differently through the training
good,"Company was by far one of the best commercial insurance agencies in the industry.  However, after the acquisition by Wells Fargo, the work culture has changed so much that it has become a revolving door with constant turnover."
good,"A decent place to work, excellent opportunity to advance your career. I would definitely recommend Wells Fargo to family and friends as a great place to work, also I have several friends who have been with the company for more than twenty plus years."
good,Wells Fargo Advisors.  Summary and take-aways: Great benefits.  Poor management.  Low upward mobility.  Workplace culture is a plus; lots of very nice people.
good,"IT and IT management in general is OK. Many people work from home, if you're into that. "
good,"just like banks, you have sales goals, your daily activity requires you to have an agenda to meet you daily sales goals. you do have ample break in between."
good,"Working at WF was like most ""jobs"" you know you have it but at the same time know that you need to keep looking for better whether it be within the company or external especially when your employer is constantly in the news for not so great things."
good,"High pressure on sale target"
good,Work culture really need improvement. Not a fair workplace. Not a lot of advancement opportunities. Managers need to be more experience with the work duties.
good,"Overall the job was pretty good at first and I met many great coworkers and customers, but I eventually saw how the pay went down as the quotas went up. I fortunately left the company 1 week before the big news broke about the fact that Wells Fargo was signing customers up for accounts they didn't want or know about."
good,"Wells Fargo is a fantastic company with a strong culture of collaboration and teamwork.  This can at times be challenging to perpetuate through a company this large, but generally we're really good t that.  Sometimes the local team can be a bit stressful."
good,"Due to recent events, working at the lower levels of the company is much better than it used to be. Whereas there used to be a ton of pressure to meet sales goals, this is no longer an issue."
good,"fast pace, very competitive, long days.  The co-workers were the best part of the job. We depended on one other to get the job.  We learned the together."
good,My leadership was not strong at all. They did not know what they were doing half of the time. They were always upsetting customers for giving wrong answers. I did not have a work life balance I pretty much lived there everyday for the last 9 years.
good,a typical day at work is coming in the morning to wait to pull a loan for review from a system. there may not be any loans to work since we are over staffed. management is fairly decent and does what they can to help us with our day to day task.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Current job has been removed due to the particular department being transferred to another company.  Company was not very helpful in attempting to relocate displaced employees to another department to prevent lay-off.  "
good,"Didn't feel I was going anywhere with Wachovia. No encouragement in education to advance. When asked about education, it was like pulling teeth to get Manager to agree this was a good idea."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was managing and collaborating with team members to create innovative solutions and continuous improvement.  I was able to mentor others and grow professionally.
good,"I would get to my desk, log in, check emails,then I would do reports that needed to get done daily. I then would answer phone calls emails all while I was processing alternative investments for FA"
good,I honestly have no issues with Wells.  Just would like to see more career advancement and opportunities within the bank that would allow for more mobile progression.
good,A typical day is processing transactions and presenting benefits to customers. You learn a lot about building relationships with customers and how to maintain them. Very good workplace culture.
good,"going through a lot of change, not good if your in a support role. Company has a great culture and I believe will repair their reputation in due time;however, advancement is hard when they are cutting positions to save money."
good,"Wells is going through some tough times right now.  With interest rates low and the ongoing legal issues, it is challenging to work there.  Once Wells gets through these issues, it will once again be a good place to work."
good,This job was very repetitive as if you were working in a factory processing the same files and paper work every single day. You would have hourly goals and if you did not reach that goal everyone in your department would know because there would be a sign next to your stall stating it.
good,"Always feeling like you are inadequate, or wrong. Total lack of communication.  Fun environment. Little drama. Girls actually enjoy each other on and off the clock."
good,Its was a fun place to work but they need to cut down on there sales . Other than that it was a nice place to work. Uts a quick growth career. Learn many things.
good,My job at Wells Fargo was the most stressful job I ever had. The management was very demanding but lazy. There was no regards for the employees from the branch manger. We were forced to work overtime but was not paid for it. It was a very horrible job experience.
good,Great place work .. you can make money they have a great team . long work days. management team is good.  the hoyrs can be long great time off you can move up
good,"I am a person that truly desires to offer my clients an ethical and trusted firm to work with in reaching their financial goals.  Over this last year, Wells Fargo has consistently shown themselves to be untrustworthy and unethical. I strive to safeguard my client's interests and through the years have built lasting relationships with those that I work with."
good,Good pay for a young adult with no kids I would say Wells Fargo was a good un grade job for me it showed me alot about the bank and I would work there again with new management
good,"Wells Fargo is face paced, customer experience driven, and competitive. Gives you great knowledge for those first time employees working in banking. Earn quarterly incentives by presenting great customer experiences and quality assurance."
good,Good place to work when it comes to work life balance. It is difficult to switch roles to a different department. You can get lost in all the politics of it all
good,"I started with First Union, then we changed to Wachovia and then Wells Fargo. Of the three, I disliked working for Wells Fargo most. We lost alot of benefits, raises were very low, no matter how hard we worked. AFter 19 years I left because I was no longer happy there. Management wasn't cooperate in helping us with any issues, and favortism was everywhere."
good,"Held different positions in a number of departments during my 25 year tenure in banking.  Reasons for multiple positions included both department transfers and promotions.  All positions focused on customer service through front line interactions as well as behind the counter investigations."
good,not the best place to consider working if you don't want to sell. its all based on that. good benefits. a lot of team work. not much room for promotion.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The organization well known and respected. Customer service was not always up to par. Management also did not use the best methods to promote growth. The customers love Wells Fargo.
good,Due to scandal there was a lot of turnover and a complete change of culture. Before the change the company was sales driven and offered lucrative bonuses as incentive for the employees to exceed sales goals. Upper level management's focus on sales at times caused a tense work environment. After the company got rid of the sales goals they become focused more on service. In my opinion that is the best thing that Wells Fargo has to offer over it's competitors.
good,"Okay company to work for, not for a career ."
good,Take care of Clients meet there financial needs by accessing need and offering financial solutions to meet all there needs to help them meet all there financial needs
good,I have been here for quite some time I am part of the down-sizing that is happening company wide. I will miss my team and the work environment I am looking for the next step in my career I know it will be grand.
good,This was by far the most stressful job Ive ever worked. The pay was awful 10 hour shifts 4 days a week. In this department you are accountable for finishing all assignments by the end of day. The problem comes about when others miss work and you are held responsible for their share of the work on top of your work load. a 10 hour shift can easily turn into a 14 hour shift when that happens.
good,"Who you get as a manager at Wells Fargo is seriously the luck of the draw. The one I have currently I do like, however, I've had managers at Wells Fargo that are so beyond lackluster. They either do nothing to help you grow in your role (believe me, I've asked this manager SEVERAL times when working for them), or they don't care enough about their job to push the team to grow as a whole. Lots of managers push for production, but have no idea how to do it themselves. If you are a subject matter expert, depending on the manager you have at the time, you either excel at this (i.e. are a part of phone calls, attend meetings with senior management, etc), or aren't properly recognized whatsoever for the amount you push yourself."
good,"I did not enjoy working at a desk in front of a computer screen all day, so my experience at WF was not great. My job was also very repetitive, which I did not enjoy."
good,"It is virtually impossible to move up or out of a current department unless you know someone.  It is not about the certifications, degrees, or how well you do in your current position.  It is sad but very true."
good,"This title company has windows based system,  I received an excel report with the title order from loan processors. A high volume with 50-80 orders in my pipeline. Lenders calling for updates constantly, I was also calling lenders with issues discovered, Then the volume slowed down, and us contractors were let go."
good,at the time sales goals were very high and hard reach. Management was excellent. Very fast past environment. On going training and education was provided along with tuition reimbursement.
good,Very Political and fast paced. Need to know how to play the corporate game.  Great opportunity for growth once you get your foot in the door.  Do your homework!
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with. They are a wonderful group of people. This being a corporate work environment the workplace culture can vary.
good,"dont ever expect a thank you for your hard work. when rates are low, there is money to be made. when rates are up there is no money to be made. great coworkers"
good,Always learning something new in the workplace and about my fellow team members. The best part of the job is enhancing my professional knowledge every day and knowing how to work with different personalities in the workplace. The worse part would be the ability to progress and grow within the company.
good,Great place to work. Company was bought out and a lot of employee lost job. Great company if benefit and integrity did not chamge. A lot of employee would stay therefore
good,I learned that this company is great for someone going to college or looking to gain some experience in a retail setting. Things change very often so you should be open to change.
good,The best part about this job is the required paid training.    The pay is not comparable to other banks for the same positions and it upward mobility does not appear to be evitable.
good,Taught me a lot of about finance and introduced me to the world of big banking. Helped me understand what I was looking for in employment and in life.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"did this job part time while in college for 3 years.  Learned a lot of great customer service skills and escalation management.  Culture was very high stress with a constant need to meet sales goals, very off putting"
good,A well managed organisation but providing a little less salary with good work pressure.forcing employees to stretch on continues basis but not bothered about providing any incentives..
good,Working at Wells Fargo is your typical 9-5 job and being the largest branch in the district it was also the busiest. We were responsible for very large amounts of cash and had the power to give it away. We were trusted with security codes and cash handling and our customers information.
good,"Great benefits - health insurance and paid time off, multiple job openings for advancement and the opportunity are various locations all over the country and a great opportunity to meet many new people."
good,"Not a lot of accountability or teamwork.  Felt like each team was working towards the goal of not being blamed for a mistake, vs. taking ownership and succeeding or failing together.   The layers of management is apparent, hiring high producers not always the answer for management positions."
good,"I had 4 roles in 3 years with 3 promotions. Some environments being more tolerable than others.  I enjoyed my time in the stores. As I had the opportunity to assist customers with their financial goals. My time at Wells Fargo Financial was absolutely terrible. I had the most incompetent, ineffective manager of my professional career."
good,Employees are encouraged to simplify processes and offer ideas to improve productivity. Extremely overworked and underpaid. Nepotism is king. Leadership have favorites.
good,Wells Fargo was a great experience for me and I gained so much knowledge from my managers and I also enjoyed the ability to work in a free standing branch as well as an in store branch.
good,"A typical day at work would start with a morning huddle about rules, regulation, ad what was expected in the day. I learned how to follow specific instructions on how to make the workplace safe at a bank. management tried to be fair The hardest part of my job was giving 100% and never feeling like you did a great or good enough for the job. The most enjoyable part was seeing the customers satisfied with what you helped them with and the team I worked with was great and we helped each other get through some of the hardest days."
good,"typical day at work"
good,Hardest part of the job was working the fraud claims and approving them even though I would find signs of fraud. Manangement was insistent we approve every fraud claim.
good,"This posistion was a result of the mortgage crisis, and possibly may not exist anymore. Strictly based on processing foreclosures and sending them to mortgage lawyers. Very mundane process and management struggled to interact with employees"
good,Researched banking guidelines and statutory requirements to stay updated on new laws and applications. Evaluate of property to summit underwriting of the value of the property.
good,"Felt undervalued for the duties being asked of me. Always felt like a number, not employee. Always felt pressured and micro managed. Would have been bearable if the compensation was reasonable."
good,"As a large corporation Wells Fargo is a great place to begin at an entry level position, advance to higher levels in the company including management. Once management and leadership skills have been developed, refined and applied successfully an employee can stay and have great job security however for those individuals that strive to achieve higher levels of intellectuality and truly aspire to make a positive effect in a company or organization, this is not the place for you as such in my case. The reason is that as a large corporation the company uses the cookie cutter drone approach. Everyone has they assigned duty or scope of reach in terms of company contribution to growth and development. As a result, I have seen intellectuals and people seeking to contribute more that the established status queue leave the company to seek opportunity in organizations that will enable their ability to maximize their true and full potential."
good,The company is an overall decent company to work for.  Depending on the team you work on will determine your work life balance.  The company has great paid time off benefits.
good,"Working here has it's pros and cons. It has a great atmosphere with fun events and entertainment, the company could work on better staffing and management."
good,"Wells Fargo is a job, period. I guess if you can tolerate the incompetence of mgmt, high stress and low salaries compared to similiar roles at other banks you would like it. I come from a different company that encouraged you to build a career, not the case here. I needed a job and took this one currently looking elsewhere. It's a shame that s company this size doesn't place more emphasis on its employees. If you take care of your people, they will take care of the company and you won't have to pressure them constantly to do it."
good,"The work place was a very nice environment, but very high pressure. We had to meet high sales goals and were constantly being reminded of sales. Advancement is very possible as long as you put in the hard work"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"When a light is bright...it will quickly become dim..."
good,"Of course you've heard the news...and it's all true - maybe even worse."
good,"Full busy and learned a lot and work place is good and no hard time work, hardest part was to manage work life and personal life. "
good,"Palmer Group is a Temp agency that helped me locate my job right out of college. Again, great training, but that was thanks to Wells Fargo, who was not directly my employer, Palmer Group was. This was a fairly boring job, very repetitive and redundant, but the pay was great as a recent college graduate with student loans coming due, it was a great job, but not the dream by any stretch."
good,You are promised opportunities to grow within the company and advance but unless you are either their favorite or continuously ask for years their is no chance of advancement. They have a very relaxed culture but if you are interested in growing and expanding your career prepare for a long wait of over 3 to 4 years for a simple promotion. The monthly bonus make the job good only if you are not interested in advancing.
good,"a typical day at work was being able to offer the right product to fit the customer's needs and to build a relationship with new and existing customers.  The hardest part of the job was working with the management team, I believe the branch manager had a personal issue with me"
good,too much pressure to sale unnecessary products to customers just to meet referral daily standards. Most of the referrals didn't lead t valid referral bonuses as promised.
good,Busy and slow days depending on the customers. Can be hectic. Overall all good. Management plays a huge role since it is a small group. They can make it good or really bad.
good,Engaging workplace with great benefits and advancement. I found upper management was the weak link as to process decisions that were made.That is all I can say in summary.
good,If you are looking for a job with amazing benefits then I recommend this job but only for that reason. It can get frustrating at times and it takes a strong individual to fake a smile throughout the day. Banking is not for everyone and that is ok.
good,"I have worked at Wells Fargo for many years.  I am very disappointed in the advancement opportunities.  I have years of trust /estate experience and obtained certifications, but I am unable to advance and the managers do not encourage career development."
good,Contract ended job was good until that point. the people i met working there were amazing and trained me like i was family. they allowed me to shine and help in the process
good,When we were Wachovia it was a nice environment. The human touch has been removed from my business unit so it seems like no one cares about you as a person and what is important to you outside of work.
good,"Quotas are unrealistic.  Should be a customer service business, yet it is all about sales.  Weekly meetings are stressful and difficult if you are not meeting their wants."
good,"Management will do everything to keep you on retail. It is a great school to learn how to sell but not a good company to grow. Work Life balance is horrible. Also, the bonuses had so many fine print, they would always try to not pay it."
good,"I've worked here for over a year and have had to over come many challenges with management and have transferred 3 different times already. It has been overwhelming and stressful, and difficult to realize if I want to even work there anymore just because they don't make it easy to get out of bad situations. But over all I got to meet some really wonderful coworkers who are now friends"
good,"Pay, benefits, and bonuses are great. Management has some things to work on but easy to advance or move departments. Job security is a big problem and you always worry."
good,"Job is based on 40 hours a week, but regularly work extended hours and available after hours weekends and while on vacation to stay on top of business.  High energy and receptive to a changing environment a must.  A great job for those that have nothing to do but work and don't want anything outside of work."
good,"productive, stable good place for advancement good benefits , not a good fit for everyone.  my years there was good I was able to move and advance in other areas"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I have seen the culture of how they treat their employees decline. It was great! then over the past 5 years really went down hill year after year. They do have good benefits health, medical, matching 401K contributions and tuition reimbursement."
good,Working the call center was very busy and making the banks quota could be challenging from time to time. Learning about the thousands of banking codes was very interesting and was a must know when explaining a customers account to them. The work environment is friendly.
good,The training and the culture are very good. Understanding the position of the company in the market helps in making the decision of what department to work for.
good,"The work is fast paced and customer focused. Team members are eligible for a range of benefits from personal time off, 401K, health, eductation reimbursement, etc."
good,"Ok place. Lots of pressure without great management or support. Expectations are set very high and training has progressively gotten worse over the years. I personally feel that the company is too large and has too many changes for anyone to truly feel comfortable in their role. Unfortunately, alot of the training is self study which doesnt really help in the real world. The management is familiar with processes and procedures however, the daily to dos, they have no clue about and really, i felt as though they couldnt actually assist me with my position or day to day duties."
good,Bitter sweet experience. Nice perks early on but atmosphere and upper management changed later making job unnecessarily difficult. Company is absurdly sales driven now and less employee friendly.
good,"typical day at work is relaxed"
good,"Overall not a bad place to work, however, in certain regions and districts favoritism is ramped.  This allows for a completely unproductive atmosphere for advancement. Many qualified and experienced individuals are passed up for job opportunities unless you are favored by certain levels of management."
good,Company truly strives to provide World Class Customer Service with a culture that is welcoming. Currently going through many business model changes to better serve internal and external customers.
good,"Always fast, payment on time, good benefits, holidays and vacations "
good,"Fun work environment, but little work guidance or help when really needed.  Could be daunting if you are new in the field.  Supervisors and managers should be more readily available."
good,I loved Wells Fargo before i worked for them. After I worked here I felt bad pressuring people to get products they didn't need. They even screwed my account up!
good,"The company mandates overtime daily to help manage call volume. There is a good training environment that will help you gain the knowledge if you are inexperienced. However, the morale in the customer department is quite cold. If you need the money and that is your main focus that would be a good pick."
good,Only a small percentage of the managers have an understanding of the job and they continue to promote only their friends/family and then lean on 1 or two people to lead the team but they pay these people the same as everyone else while the managers sit back and gossip and look at fantasy football and press refresh on their screen all day and check production numbers.
good,"There are some areas that allow team members to work from home - not mine, working from home is frowned upon - simply because of the mind set of the leadership team."
good,The company in a whole is a great company. but this is the worst office in the entire company. Are stats are very low and management will not change to conform to the new style of work
good,I was given a number of opportunities to expand my knowledge in the management field while doing what I love best.  WFHM gave me a platform to expand my career opportunities.
good,"people were motorvated but we werent always rewarded, its ok to start out here, but leave! Here why, Boss can be a pain from time to time, sometimes its tough to find the engineer or network guy"
good,"At the time of employment management was good and employees were treated fairly"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Unfair compensation... raises are not more than 1%"
good,"Wells Fargo, while it is a fun place to work, is also very competitive. Job promotions are rare and are usually given to the person with the most time under their belt, not the people who go above and beyond to meet goals."
good,"Underwriting for Private Mortgage Banking, Wealth Management. Management, always in meetings , not available; but I get it :-)"
good,A typical day at work within the banking industry...constant change no transparency within management.  limited work/life balance. long hours. compensation too low
good,"For such a large and storied financial institution, the processing and administrative support is lacking. Management needs more involvement in employee development. There is a lot of potential for prospective employees as long as you can work around the disarry."
good,This company has great diversity within its ranks. But annual salary raises and changing bonus structure has left many employees making less money than before.
good,This was a temp position. I learn a lot about mortgages. What I should look for went taking out a mortgage loan.  The hardest part of this job was training full time employees that they hired to your job.
good,I currently work in credit card collections department. Working here isn't terrible but it's not something I would want to continue doing for a long time. Job gets repetitive not easy to advance in the position. They advertise that it's easy to bonus each month but in reality less than have the front end collections department bonuses each month. If your not in the top collectors on your team they threaten termination which I didn't like at all. Other than that I enjoy the people I work with the pay is decent for a call center job. We have a lot of fun and talking to customers is usually easy it's rare when you get a customer who is very harsh. Only other thing I would say is it is a decent company to work for but not a good company to bank with.
good,"If you can handle working without close supervision and remain productive this is a decent job. a typical day includes ordering stock, delivering stock, maintaining a relationship with end users, and (potentially) processing orders from around the country. working behind the scenes to keep the campus up to speed I have the opportunity to interact with a large portion of the campus if I choose. most of the other employees are polite and seem to enjoy working here as well."
good,"I enjoy the work that I do and would love to continue learning and have an opportunity to become full-time employee. Getting to know others in different areas of the company. Love the diversity, and the culture."
good,"Wells Fargo was an ok job, high sales were required and the pay was low. There was a lot of pressure to make sales goals each day."
good,"This job is simple. It's well structured, and if you're okay with doing the exact same thing every day, its perfect."
good,"Really wonderful career for someone starting in the financial field, but in the Philadelphia growth was very hindered by upper management during the years in which I was part of the team."
good,The job didn't pay well. the company wasn't to keen on training and educating. The branch was very demanding. Management only cared about advancing it's self. The only thing I enjoyed was awesome co-workers.
good,"in a new position, new division.  very stressful, juggling several projects/tasks at once, not much breathing room.  everything is a deadline, everything is urgent, everything is due yesterday.  management are all work a holics.  good pay, good benefits.  corporate culture is unfriendly.  management can be supportive."
good,"This wasn't a bad place to work, however, observed bankers taking advantage of people by opening accounts for them they never ask for.  At the time I did not know what was happening.  But later after left, over 5000 employees was let go due to high pressure sales from the higher ups.  Had I known at that time, I would have let someone know."
good,When I left it was still Wachovia.  It didn't pay much but the benefits were good.  Lots of incompetent people were hired for team positions and many incompetent people became team leaders.
good,"Help desk. Daily receive calls and process escalations that are in writing via workflow or email. Help in anyway possible. Go above and beyond to assist my caller. Advise of timelines, code accounts, verify information, trading issues, account set up and eligibility. i love my team mates we have a great team. The hardest part of the job is to deal with irate callers and delivering bad news regarding processes."
good,I was being moved into a management position & ended up leaving the company as they were asking me to do things I was uncomfortable with to meet goals
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo Bank was a great place for me to learn the skill sets that will benefit for the rest of my career.  They are involved in almost every aspect of the financial industry, which provides opportunities to pursue cheer paths outside of retail banking."
good,Benefit is not good. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people to work with.  The hardest part of the job is the management.
good,"I work only 26 hours a week. Management okay. Co-worker was the best. You was not aloud to listen on your head phone while you did your work, They didn't like you to talk to each other,"
good,"culture is not good, very stressful and tools not available to enjoy and get job done. co-workers makes it a bit less stressful."
good,"Processed all basic transactions; deposits, withdrawls ect. Teamwork is a requirement, have to get along with everyone - which was easy. We had an awesome team of bankers and tellers. Love helping and answering questions which clients had."
good,"I appreciated all the knowledge I acquired working for this company. And the ability to help people was amazing, when that was the focus."
good,the training was really good. When I completed the training I understood 90% of my job duties. very professional staff. everyone was very helpful. I also had opportunity to work from home.
good,"People are very friendly and outgoing, IT management not so great. No real leadership or mentoring. Work is based on metrics. not much moral support. The IT infrastructure is not well balanced. Instead of being one support group for the entire company, each department group has its own IT support providing the same support. Doesn't make sense."
good,"I learned to have fun at work as much as in life. I also learned how to organize clothing and the procedures of back stocking inventory, I learned the managing of individual and team goals."
good,I learned a lot from my position on many different levels but the culture and sales aspect was something that I did not agree with. I would also have liked to move up in the company but they were very stingy on allowing movement within.
good,Wells Fargo is vested in it' employees. I love that they encourage you to do community service as well as charitable giving year round.  The leadership is vested in seeing your wants and desires come to fruition.
good,"During my time at Wells Fargo I noticed quickly that it was not going to be an easy job. The department I was in dealt with frustrated customers who were declined during a transaction."
good,"Wells fargo was an awesome experience and they pay very good, but I had a high risk pregnancy and I had to let them go.I worked there for a little more than half a year."
good,A typical work day begins with logging into several systems then checking email and voice mail.  Next I prioritize my work according to urgency and handle any pressing items.  I learned many computer systems as well as using Microsoft Office and became an expert in them.  My co-workers were great people and we were able to form a great team and learned to work efficiently together.  I enjoyed my job because it utilized my degree as a paralegal.
good,"I think Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. The benefits are great. You start with 2 weeks of PTO for the year. They do have unrealistic goals, and there is a report for everything you do. (micromanaging)"
good,"Wells Fargo has the best perks, however management is not very helpful. They will tell you that you can grow with the company and change positions within a year but only move within the same dept. Pay is o.k. for a customer care position. Rarely change your schedule."
good,"Not terrible, but not awesome. Your job here likely will depend upon what department you are in. Like any company, there are good jobs and bad jobs within."
good,I was employed with Prudential Securities and my position was eliminated due to the merger between Prudential and Wachovia in 2004.
good,I really don't want to have to write a review of every company I have ever worked for just to be able to seek new employment.
good,"Fast-paced sales environment.  I work in the insurance division.  Management style is predicated upon the Sales Team which pretty much runs the office and makes the decision.  Most people are great to work with but there is a lot of division within the Employee Benefits department and office politics.  I have learned a lot within my one year tenure.  I gained more exposure to medical benefits, knowledge of ACA regulations and Healthcare Reform.  The Sales Team is very tenured.  This is a pro and a con.  They are very knowledgeable about the business; however, the way they go about their business is very outdated, which I think causes a hindrance in their ability to increase revenue on a consistent basis and puts them behind the ball of a lot of their fellow brokerage competitors.  This could be a result of them being tied to the bank and there is a lot of  compliance that must be followed.  The work style of the environment was the hardest part of my job, but the most enjoyable is that I got a chance to learn a lot and be exposed to the role of management which I truly enjoy."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I enjoyed the job I had, I enjoyed working with my clients. I feel, that at the time. my co-workers needed to grow up. there was a lot of childish events. And how people acted. I was happy to leave this place when I was given a chance."
good,"Prepare for open by making coffee and tea, take orders through drive through or in house. Meet many people, train new baristas, make food, prep for next day."
good,They're a good company to work for they. Have a lot of expectations for they employees to meet requirements that are sometimes impossible.
good,"Work on the invoice & PO aging reports pull via Oracle BIEE  system  using all different excel functions such as V-look up, Concatenate, Pivot tab, text and column... etc.."
good,"Short staffed, to pushy with sales and no incentive to strive for better (at least at the branch i was located) management is manipulative and two faced"
good,"Good company, very conservative, outdated systems. Training is obsolete and inconsistent. Great opportunity for students to intern and learn about the profession with the possibility of gaining a full time job."
good,It is fast paced and definitely teaches you to work in professional work place but  the inner office politics are a little frustrating
good,This company has pushy sales policy and does not have the customers best interest in mind. However it is easy to transfer locations and move with this company.
good,the job its self isn't that difficult its meeting the call quality evaluations that make it difficult for an employee to meet limiting their abilities to resolve issues on first calls. but overall the fellow coworkers are pleasant the management team are very helpful and supportive of their agents that report to them.
good,"very high competitive environment , were you are more of just there to make sales and not appreciated for being a good employee"
good,"If you're okay with having a sales oriented job then Wells Fargo is going to be a great place to work for you. Just know that you're going to be micro managed down to the bone. They have reports for reports on reports here so you'll definitely feel the pressure. A typical day for me starts with a huddle where our manager tells us what we're doing wrong sales wise, and gives us a time frame to get the percentage up. We then go to our desks, and write in ""Banker Journals"" about how we plan on improving whatever it is we're not getting 100% on (which by the way is Wells Fargo's minimum....100%).  I remember being in school and if I remember correctly 100% equals an A+ so I'm not sure where they get that figure from. Funny that a place with so many percentages and numbers gets that wrong...I digress. At that point I take this journal to my manager for her to review, get a signature from me on that page of the journal and copy to their manager...in other words there's always going to be a scapegoat here if performance slips. Not one person that I've talked to here feels secure in their position and frankly most of the people end up leaving to go work somewhere else (management included). I've been through 4 managers since I've been with Wells Fargo, and countless other employees have left as well. As I said before if you consider yourself a salesperson then this is the job for you. Make no mistake though, you will call at least 50 people per day (glorified telemarketer), have to try and push a sale on every person who comes through the doors, and wonder when you're going to be replaced"
good,Company culture is decent. Salaries are underwhelming. Co workers are great. Lots of customer service issues.Typical day at work is non stop service and interaction with clients
good,it is nice to receive insurance benefits and paid time off when needed and have 401k. team members are helpful and I learned more skills to benefit my career. the hardest part of the job is always trying to make everyone happy.
good,if you are willing to move then upward mobility is there.  Work life balance lacks though with some 13 days in a row worked at a time.  Great group of folks though.
good,It was a job not a career.  There is a huge turnover for this position and at the time customers did not seem to understand why we high authenticated them
good,"In their defense, our market was out of the way of major metro areas and would not have deserved the attention of larger branches in more heavily populated, less seasonal environments."
good,Wells Fargo was a small group.  This allowed everyone to form and build solid relationships. New processes were updated all the time. The buyers and the collection team worked closely together. There were regular meetings between the two teams.
good,"Though the business atmosphere was professional, MGT was lacking personal skills and depth. On several times MGT would publicly yell or embarrass employees. "
good,"After 3 years, I didn't feel valued for all the contributions I had made at Wells Fargo. I didn't advance because of one requirement. Sales. They would rather have me sell a credit card to someone, who does not need one, is in the process of paying off their debt, or is retired and living off social security, than to simply provide exceptional customer service and make the customer feel valued, instead of a potential sale."
good,WellsFargo has excellent benefits but working at the DUC (Distribution Center) is a head-ache at times.  The management isn't always friendly I don't think cause they already have a permanent position so if you're temp its like your beneath them.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,this position at Wells Fargo allowed me to develop my customer service skills and sales skills. I was able to work with a good team and we were all able to reach our goals.
good,"Typical work day consists of interacting with customers and making phone calls. Also, networking for more business and reaching out to surrounding businesses. Wells Fargo is very team oriented and all about gaining new relationships. The hardest part about working with this company is always having to try to sell something to a customer even when you don't feel it would benefit them and also all of the long ""after work hours"" meetings."
good,Company loves to hire contractors so they can cut them when the want and don't have to pay commissions. Benefits aren't great.
good,"WF really is at the top of the pay scale when it comes down to it, but there is little to be desired by the way they treat their employees. Both times I was employed here I felt like a number and not a human. Big business just churning and burning through customers even though they preach about trying to serve the customer as best they can- this is very far from the truth. Management seems more concerned with spreadsheets than the employees."
good,Has a lot of benefits. The work place is very micromanaged. You have a lot of duties and goals you must hit. flexible with vacations
good,"Great Job security, diverse workforce work life balance can be a challenge at times, lots of advancement opportunities depending on your area."
good,"this was a position that was fun, exciting and challenging.I learned remote assistance techniques, dispatch of emergency personal for break-ins, robberies, broken glass and equipment, Unix operating system, point of sale troubleshooting. management was ok, co workers were great to work with knowledgeble, and willing to share their knowledge, hardest part of the job was trying to stay awake in early morning hours after being called in for an emergency. the most enjoyable part of the job was working in a good clean environment with updated equipment."
good,"One has to be flexible because one is expected to work different books of businesses (i.e., HAMP, foreclosure, Chapter 7 and 13 bankruptcies)."
good,"Working for "
good,I just didn't like they way they would handle things with their customers. You were just a number to the managers. Only thing good there was the pay.
good,in a typical day you'd see 100+ people as a teller. its a great way to work on your people skills. Wells Fargo focuses a lot on sales and customer service. The problem is that sometimes management forgets that customer service is always first and not sales. So if you are sales driven its the job for you that'll get you ready for any costumer service opportunity. Hardest part is the stress and management pushing you. It is however a great environment to meet new people make friends build the perfect mind set as to what is expected in any job with face to face interaction.
good,"I like working at wells fargo , great company for the most part . I Believe they need better teachers , they rush the classes and barely help"
good,"start my day reading emails and responding to request, i then worked my spread sheet.  opportunity are availabe tuition reimbursement. profit sharing i think is one of there best benefilts."
good,"The work was definitely a great experience. It was challenging and fun. It was also hard, having to learn new things during the job and adapting to new changes. The given tasks were always finished at a timely manner. The environment I worked in was a very good environment. I enjoyed being on my own most at Wells Fargo. I was able to get more work done, be flexible within working hours. The management wasn't the greatest in the department. During my time at Wells Fargo, I learned a lot about shipping and receiving items and supplies. I learned how to manage and organize work areas and time. Best thing I did was always planning ahead for the following day, making sure work was finished as best as possible."
good,This was a productive yet stressful company to work for. I was young when I started advancement opportunities are limited in the AOC there is not really much room for advancement at all.
good,"Pretty good company to work for as Wachovia but once wells fargo took over, things changed. Enjoyed working with the people, just was hard for advancement."
good,"Definitely has to be for you. It will also depend on how much your managers like you. Worth ethic doesn't really matter for promotions. Long as you can make friends and work together for ""sales"""
good,"I hate to say this, but this was the worse job I have ever had. The work load was simply unreasonable and the turnover was extreme.  Office environment was toxic with people screaming and demanding and no manager oversighrt.  In the seven months I worked at Wells Fargo, five of eight of the processors quit.  I provided two week notice but most employees did  not."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Not a progressive work environment, but very predictable organizational inertia.  Can be overly Political  & a manager that ONLY wants to see Russian Resumes presented to her."
good,"Wachovia Bank at the time was super aggressive in its branch bank site development, I would not trade the experience for any  other job at the time."
good,Overall Wells Fargo was a good company. The hardest part of the job was following vague guidelines. The most enjoyable part of the job was having my own cubicle space.
good,long hours to get the job done. Management hardly available for answers.  All suggestion heard but never used.  Program used for work was unreliable.
good,You can grow very quickly within the company but there is just terrible management overall which is required to provide crazy sales goals.
good,"Pay is much lower than that of comparable companies, but Wells Fargo does have fairly good benefits.  18 days of PTO/year starting which does not include the 6 paid holidays.  "
good,"overall satisfied from the last 20 years , benefits is a plus, through my years I have taken away detail in management and the development of peers."
good,"Everyone is a salesman and rewarded for short term successes which makes one wonder if they understand that Wealth Management is a long run proposition between the client and the team.  Now the company promotes a competitive environment among team members that used to be more collegial--to the detriment of the client. Also, dealing with a size issue, they have gone down the path of putting all clients in a box. All this makes it difficult for people who are more client centric and better for those who are best at playing the corporate game."
good,"I did not enjoy the position that I had, although some people in the company did seem to like theirs.  My boss was very scatter brained and had to retire suddenly, leaving the team without a full time manager.  Many team members complain a lot and I did not like the amount of traffic there was in driving downtown."
good,different departments have different abilities . My current position was very stressful and the management was very belittling
good,"*Consists of a variety of tasks that need to be completed, I am able to successfully work through the tasks."
good,Wells fargo has some unfair practices but is a professional place to work. the profit sharing is good but some upper management is unfair and prejudice.
good,Supervised all tellers working in the lobby and on the teller line. Gave approvals for certain transactions when needed.
good,"Horrible management, poor employee morale. No definite strategies provided by management. Skeleton crew works there. A consistent air of the site closing at anytime"
good,"Less focus on customers, greater focus on upselling products to customers.  More concern with politics over getting the job done."
good,management does not value workers; lower level employees not rewarded based on skill or competency; Very little ability to move up or be promoted with levels of experience requirements in nearly all positions.
good,"Daily manager meeting/phone conferences about goals and your progress. Management would at times micro managed, but most would still followed work ethics. Co-workers would constantly be stressed because they didn't have enough ""sales/solutions""."
good,"With working at a bank you are always on your toes to be alert for strange things going on. Greet every person that walks through the door. Accept the customers deposit, cash check, help if there are any issues with their accounts. Always having a friendly smile on your face  to make them feel appreciated for their business. My responsibilities were making sure you drawer is in balanced, order supplies, keeping atm supplied, and referring new banking items."
good,Wells Fargo  is not a great place to work.Unless you enjoy being yell'd at to push you with the required daily quota.  you must meet or get terminate.Also Rude Managers that are extremely arrogant and conceited with no respect towards you specially in the Spanish Department their are several ladies their that will embarrass you during a call with a reminder about your daily quota either by walking by your cubicle or will shot it out loud for all to hear how good or how poorly you are doing that day. Any no team work other than them two ganging up on you to meet her quota and try to get you fired or make you look bad through out the day.
good,"It wouldn't be surprising to say its a very corporate environment.  Every aspect of the job is set to follow standards which were often created in accordance with legacy systems and are never reviewed when parameters change.  Development often delivers code very late, and is adversarial when asked to fix bugs."
good,I have learned the value of team work and how to be a team player. My co workers make this job a great place to work. They have many opportunities for advancements.
good,"Great company to work for, just a lot of favoritism if you want to advance. Many of my co workers were very nice, its just that upper management didn't give much recognition."
good,"A typical day at work is that of opening accountants and maintaining customer's profiles as well as servicing them by providing solutions to their problems. "
good,"Days are quite hectic at wells but it also gives opportunity to learn."
good,"great company, not a big fan of how major banks run but who am I to question a company who has been around longer than I have been alive and will still be here after I die."
good,The brand is nice and the access to existing Wells Fargo clients is probably the biggest plus.  The environment is very corporate with a lot of red tape and several layers of management.
good,"Pros: 200% RRSP match , paid overtime, covered parking"
good,Fun place to work but very sales driven. Nice customers as well as staff but your sales are monitored by the hour every day
good,"Overall, it was a decent job, however I wanted a job with better pay, and Monday-Friday hours. In the specific location I was at, the work environment wasn't the most positive."
good,"call customer and set an appointment for business and consumer account.we talk about how to improved our customer services."
good,"Hello!  I am an energetic people person!  I'm also a 30 year bank analyst that has been groomed around quality customer service.  I'm professional, analytical and very detailed oriented. I work in Charlotte but live in Statesville, NC so I'm looking for employment closer to home, possibly Statesville, Mooresville or the Hickory area."
good,"Every morning we would start with our daily opening procedures, open cash vault. Etc. After the store was ready for operating we would have a warm up meeting and go over the daily sales goals."
good,"Long term limited growth in the opportunities for personal development outside of sales or marketing for me.  Success within the  scripted inbound sales, limited  upward movement."
good,"I have had better jobs with lots more advancement opportunities and I have had worse.  This isn't a bad place to work, but there are still problems where you see a lot of supervisors/managers that have risen to their highest level of competency. They have great pto times, but they dont' change from year three to year 10."
good,"I work for the advisors side and the benefits are great. The work environment is great. My manager is awesome but.... unless you want to be a an advisor or move to the greater new york area, there is no room for advancement witihin the company. getting a raise is also a whole other battle. its a shame because otherwise this is an ideal situation for anyone to work in. hopefully sooner than later whomever the big wigs are will realize, hey we should really pay people more otherwise they are going to continue to lose great employees, like myself. Do your self a favor and look elsewhere if you are trying to work your way up the ranks, because at Wells Fargo there isnt a glass ceiling... its reinforced plexiglass and it doesnt discrimate against anyone :-/"
good,"Very stressful, I do not like to refer products to customers, especially irrate customers. The expectations are over the top and the solutions for customers' issues is another product from the employer."
good,It was a very interesting job learning about the banking world. I was hired from outside the bank-my friend and I were the first hired outside the bank in 10 years.
good,"Great Place to work! Provided enough appointments. However, after setup up was complete, clients were having issues getting to NMS customer service lines."
good,"Departments constantly closing and employees loosing their job. Everyone feared being displaced. When a mortgage department closed, my department had to take over job duties with only one day of training."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Honestly, it was a place where you can depend on a payroll check. You did not have to worry about a layoff, and the company has history."
good,"Some days are great, other days are a beat up session with some managers. Not willing to work with you to help you advance but more than willing to beat you down and make you want to quit."
good,"Nice building but at some times unprofessional not a lot of management support.  Typical day would consist of multitasking, dealing with various documents and system errors."
good,"This was probably one of the best companies I have worked for, we constantly had goals and incentives we were pushing to meet, and the rewards paid off handsomely. It was unfortunate when we experienced layoffs, but I had put in 5 years there and met alot of great people and gained alot of good experience and for that I am grateful."
good,"I would answer calls from customers needing to look up the bank account information, help with the website, and dispute charges on their accounts. I would also upsell various products, including addition checking or savings accounts, insurances, and credit cards or loans. After upselling the additional products, and receiving the customer's consent, I would transfer them to account specialists who would then go over the information on the products in more detail and open the account for the customers. It was a fast-paced environment, with very little time between calls. I was expected to meet standards for call times, after call work times, sales quotas, etc."
good,I enjoyed working for wells fargo. I honestly just felt like wells fargo didn't really appreciate me as a human and also as their employee.
good,This employer is very money driven. They have no value for employees or cliental. I would only recommend Wells Fargo to those who have only work to focus on.
good,"Wells Fargo has since been absorbed by other alarm companies but when I was there it was a major player with accounts in manufacturing, logistics and institutional facilities. I had access to jobsites when businesses were closed and made repairs so their locations could be protected. My co-workers and managers were knowledgeable and supportive. The hardest part of the job was working alone in poorly lit, cold, and dangerous environments through the night on second and third shifts. Once, the job was complete, it was nice to know the site was secure."
good,"Typical day: Required to open and close store daily."
good,"I have to say that I learned a lot in two years I've been there. I loved interactions with customers while helping them with banking needs. Nothing was hard for me to do, but being a greater for couple of hours a day was quite bit annoying."
good,"If you want to be worked like a dog with little pay, this is the job for you. The place I worked at was not ethnically diverse. It was a cut throat call center environment with little patience for improvement or chances for advancement. Very little pay."
good,"There's a lot to be said professionally, yet there seems to be more they can do internally for promotion and advancement I find they're very weak within this area. After several years of working with Wells Fargo, It's a great company culture with diversity, but that's where it stops."
good,"My typical day at work varies on a daily basis.  I have coached and trained new employees. The hardest part of my job telling customers no.  However, I always give them with hope.  The enjoyable part of my job is helping small business owners to resolve some of their financial needs."
good,"you can move up quickly in the company"
good,"As a teller there is so much to do and learn. You are responsible for your cash drawer which needs to be balanced twice, daily. At the beginning and end of your shift. Cross selling is important as those are you solutions and a way to achieve your sales goals."
good,•	Ensure the timely and accurate packaging of all loans originated by the loan officers. Gathered information and was responsible to input proper loan information into the system for processing and ensured documentation is complete and complies with company policy.
good,Not very customer friendly.  I feel that it is hard to retain customers as well as employees. I would like to work for a more customer friendly bank as a Lead teller.
good,Provides excellent source of leads and internal referrals.  Incentives are good however I believe more emphasis could be placed on the customer.
good,good place to work - fast paced in sales. I learned about more banking products and investments. The hardest part of the job is meeting the high sales quotas they have set for the tellers.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"This position gave me perspective into what I would like to do going forward.  I gained experience in sales, personal and business finance, and customer service."
good,"Overall good company, worked for them in two different locations, over a period of 8 years.  Just moved to the Gulf Coast in 2012, and to advance much higher within the company, I would have to relocate, because positions are limited in my area."
good,"Ridiculous sales goals: Very sales oriented:  Consistent pressure to sell:  It's all a # game trying to get customers to buy into to products that they don't necessary need. Unethical sales."
good,Placed in group in which I had no interest after being promised a different group before signing offer letter.  Once I got my group assignment it was too late to look for other banking opportunities.  Experience ended up being something different than I signed up for so I left.
good,"I was hired as a Branch Manager Trainee, but when Wachovia merger with First Union that all went away.  I became a Senior Personal Banker.  I had my own month goal to reach for bank product, deposits dollars, loans and loan amounts.  I worked very hard at my job trying to show the branch Manager that I was team player all the through.  I made my bank product a lot of time and exceeded my loan amount goal.  Deposit dollars was sometimes hard to make, but I did several times.  i enjoyed working in a traditional branch because the branch was closed on the weekend and all national holidays."
good,"This is a solid company to work for, they offer opportunities for advancement to those who sell, sell, sell and give decent vacation time as well as paid holidays. The screening process when they hire new team members ensures you are surrounded by great people however, there are still some bad eggs that get through. The pay isn't bad but can feel like it isn't enough the more things you go above and beyond for and deal with on a daily basis. Closing at 4 on a Saturday is absolutely ridiculous and you will still have people trying to get in at 4:01, despite the bank being open 2-3 more hours than other institutions."
good,"I was a phone banker so I was on the phone all day long, I enjoyed it for the first few hours its just hard for me to stay in one position all day long. I learned allot with this job in regards  to banking and financial needs loved that part. Some of the supervisor are awesome and some were not as helpful at times. I made a few friends with this job but we really are stuck on the phone so i didn't really get a chance to mingle with any of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was adherence for me if i needed a 5 min break of the phone it counted against me i would have to explain to my supervisor sometimes why i wasn't on the phone and it was mostly because i was using the restroom. the most enjoyable part was the benefits like insurance and 401k and pto. I am such a people person didn't realize how not being able to meet my customers face to face would effect me."
good,"Wells is an old company and there were many unnecessary procedures, my job was pretty administrative, and there wasn't any opportunities for advancement."
good,"To be honest; it paid the bills. For a company with so much history, I expected more customer relation than the ""Why your bill haven't been paid..."" It was a change for me, but I did succeed within the company with a change in my ""people-person personality."""
good,"Drove analytics, and supported treasury management sales priorities for two Treasury Management Sales Officers. Facilitated marketplace and client base analytics, identifed trends, usage, opportunities, and prospecting ideas.  Liaised between client, sales, and internal partners."
good,There was job security but limited chances for advancement in the position I held.
good,"it was a nice fun environment. Every one was real nice at first when i was in training. They had a lot of false hopes. The hardest part was having to sit all day and talk to 80-140 people a day back to back, it was stressful. Once you hit the floor the management staff does not care of you but about your numbers."
good,"The job is sales...sell, sell, sell. Wells talks about customer service a lot but sell, sell, sell. Co-workers and most of the customers are all pretty cool. Management, however, are all top sales people with no management skills/friends of other managers. Full time hours can be hard to get. Sales goals are set very high so hope u  get a busy branch. The banks are a sell at any price culture. Turnover is very high because of this."
good,"- Days vary from busy to very slow. Everyday is almost the same. Transactions, customer service, handle money, rinse and repeat. It's an easy job."
good,"After nearly two years with the company, I can't recommend working here:"
good,My co-workers were the best. Everyone pitched in when need. Management was helpful when difficult questions were introduced. The enjoyable part of the job was learning new software and guidelines.
good,"I used to love working for Wells Fargo Corporate Trust. With some recent management changes, feelings changed very quickly. I went from enjoying my job and having a feeling of value to the company to being a meaningless number, like all the years I invested was worthless. This is mainly concentrated in one department, RMBS."
good,I dont know if this is all Wells Fargos but the on in Brunswick can be a great place to work as long as you're a part of the in crowd. Its a shame that your contributions go unnoticed if you are not a friend of management
good,Great training. Customer Service and Sales driven. Everyday you have a goal to meet to be successful.
good,Great company to work for. Plenty of room for advacement. A lot of trainning with policies and sales coaching. Co-workers are great.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,A typical day as a business specialist includes outbound sales activities and customer visits for relationship management. I have learned how to work well with all people and manage my own work day for success. The quality of management varies by area but most managers support the bankers in their roles. The hardest part of the job is being in front of the right people at the right time to engage in sales conversation. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with business owners who are the lifeline of our country's economy.
good,the customers were the best part of the business.There was too much favoritism and clicks
good,"I use to love my job, but recent change in management has me looking for a new job after 18 years."
good,Strict Sales enviroment. Can move up quickly with correct attitude.
good,Great spot on get your foot in the door. You will be micromanaged all day everyday. Pay is very low. Great benefits. You will use your PTO. The job will drive you nuts. Take the 2 years experience and get a good job that pays well.
good,"assist TA and help co-works."
good,Worked as a teller. Loved to count the money in the vault. Liked most of the customers who came in. Enjoyed helping customers balance there checkbooks
good,"There is no work life balance just work all the time "
good,It was a nice place to work. The hardest part of the job was the very long hours.
good,"fast growing company with a lot of opportunity to move up. "
good,basic security officer for clients inside goverment office building.  Making rounds both inside and outside parking lots.  to check periodically during shift.
good,"Not a fan of forced sales.  At Wells Fargo, I was forced to ""sell"" something to every customer that walked through the doors."
good,Limited opportunity for advancement. Goals are not tailored for individual branch.
good,"Wells Fargo Mortgage is an enjoyable place to work. The camaraderie with fellow employees aids in a receiving a positive experience.The willingness of employees assisting each other working through the difficulties of paradigm shifts, fosters a favorable experience."
good,"WF is a good place to work if you are a hard worker. You are not micro managed and again, if you work hard, you will advance. The pay is not great, and neither are the health benefits though. The vacation time is great though and depending on who you work for, the start and end times are somewhat flexible, as long as you work your 8 hours per day in an allotted time frame. The training is very poor though and you are pretty much thrown into your position and you have to have the patience to learn on your own. I have been here 4 years and advanced several times, but again, you have to have patience and be willing to work hard and you will be rewarded, although compensation is certainly NOT Wells Fargo's strong suit."
good,I learned a great deal about the mortgage business. I was able to develop my sales skills. Only drawback was the limited products that I was able to offer clients.
good,"Wells Fargo is a fast pace workplace. Always on your feet and constantly moving - you're either climbing up steps or running down the other end of the vault looking for files. The files are lined up numerically so having a keen eye to number is essential. You're required to pull files to meet daily goals. I've learned to work better in a fast pace workplace and I've learned the importance of meeting deadlines and reaching daily goals. Managers are helpful and respectful. They direct you to the right area if lost or just can't seem to locate a certain file. The hardest part of the job is probably looking at files that are in numerical order. It's not one digit that you're looking at, you're looking at several number on one file. Although it may sound simple but pulling files really is a race against time, especially when you have a daily goal to reach. Overall, it's place that will always keep you moving and time goes by quick, sometime too quick."
good,"Unorganized, Mismanaged and there is a lot of office politics."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Customer Service is exceptional. Very stressful job environment with higher level management wanting more and more every day.
good,"robotic, a lot of politics"
good,"The team meetings in the morning were motivational, but after that it was all about numbers on the phone. The hardest part of the job was reading through all of the disclosures of the application once you finally did get a sale and customers would get aggravated at how long the application process was. The most enjoyable part of the job was when they would run contests to keep motivation up to make sales."
good,Working for this job will get you by if you have no major responsibilities.
good,This company has great benefits and a good work/life balance however; ALOT of pressure to increase sales.  When looking for other opportunities within the company it is difficult.  They push and pull you and aren't very honest.
good,Good company to work for with benefits and hours of operation.
good,helping customers succeed financially is our job. opening checking and savings accounts for customers
good,"Met a lot of great people whilst working at Wells Fargo."
good,A typical day at work would be to complete any procedures or tasks requested by supervirsor and complete general company duties that were required based on job description. I learned to utilize my resources to complete requested tasks in a timely manner. Management was helpful in assisting with constructive feedback to better my work performance. My co workers were professional and helpful in assisting and commpleted teamwork related activities. The hardest part of the job would be cramming last minute requested workloads to meet company deadlines due to short staff. The most  enjoyable part of the job was the whole experience.
good,"- Provided support for Vice President of HR and Recruiting Team Leader, along with administrative support for 6 Recruiting Consultants covering Birmingham, North Alabama, Mississippi & Tennessee"
good,"Still one of the better big banks to work for stability wise.  Seems they are still dealing with the Wachovia merger from a upper management standpoint.  Large amount of duplicate positions near the top, clogging the pipeline of general promotions, and losing promising team members to their neighbor across the street (BoA)"
good,"Great company with lots of opportunity to advance. Amazing team and coworkers. A lot of responsibility and sales pressure. Having to worry 24/7 about numbers and meeting your daily goal. If the daily goal is not met then there are meetings and call nights.Even though the sales pressure is tough and competition is brutal, the employees try to make it a good day. we host BBQ and happy hours to take the stress off. Great Job if you are a sales person. with awesome opportunities to grow!."
good,I would assist customers on the teller line. Providing them with WOW level customer service. While process transactions I would be able to get to know my customers and see what they could benefit from in regards to products and services. Management was constantly busy at the branch and a lot of the decisions were left up to us at the teller line. We were able to rely on each other and make the sound judgements for our customers.
good,"The job itself isnt bad, management is great. However, after being here for a minimal amount of time we were told the branch was moving to AZ. Overall a good workplace."
good,I valued my time with my co-workers and management. the facilities had wonderful amenities such as a cafeteria and great benefits.
good,I enjoy the employment there at Wells Fargo but the only down fall is it is a temp to hire and they don't hire you unless there is an open position. The other downfall is the management tend to show favortisim. Besides that I love what I do there.
good,Great work life balance. Company focused too much on sales and not on helping customers.
good,my typical day consisted of opening the store and increasing sales opportunities with customers.
good,"Telephone Sales/ Mortgage Loan Originator: Performed sales tasks, loan fulfillment, initial underwriting, and loan servicing duties in all 50 states as required by company and federal guidelines."
good,"I personally dont like the teller position, its for those who dont mind or need direct supervision."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The hardest part of this job is having no encouragement, just hearing what you are doing wrong or not meeting expectation on. You can be exceeding in 4 areas of your metrics but if you are failing in one, that is the only one you hear about. The benefits with Wells Fargo are out of this world, but if you're not happy in what you are doing, you should make a change."
good,"walk in log in to your assigned station. Pull out drawer from main safe, count your money make sure your balanced. Start assisting customers."
good,"company has a great vision and business model, but all areas do not adopt the culture the company advocates."
good,"* team environment"
good,It feels like you have very little control over your success.  Higher productivity is the number one priority which is difficult when the number of responsibilities is continuously rising.  The stress level is very high and morale is very low.
good,nothing special was a job. Management was not professional
good,"•	Collects sorts and delivers incoming, outing and interdepartmental mail."
good,"Sell retail banking products and services to customers and prospects "
good,Strict work environment. Not family friendly. Co-workers are pleasant to work with. Management micro-manages.
good,A typical day at work consists of you servicing customers over the phone. You are the phone most of the day and you are also required to sell products and services to customers. There are daily sales goals that are required to meant by the site.
good,"As a home loan processor I feel, micro-managed, good benefits, no longer feel challenged"
good,"I really enjoyed working here overall, just family and life balance is nonexistence. If you're single without kids this would be the ideal job for you. Great benefits and a great staff."
good,not a great work envoriment.  it used to be a great place to work but so much has hanged it's not the same
good,"Daily site and individual goal to be met on quality, quantity and customer service guidelines."
good,My coworkers were my teammates and some of the mens' basketball players. It was one evening that we volunteered. It was my first time actually handling a cash register. It was pretty simple. I was able to interact with the customers and provide excellent service for them
good,"Wonderful hours, Meet great customers, Hardest part of the job was having to go through a multiple changes in management."
good,My experience at Wells Fargo was as a Overdraft collector. I will say it was pretty mundane call center work.
good,Outside sales originating mortgages. Underwriting guideline changes and company restrictions made it very difficult to reach sales goals especially after rates went up.  Market conditions with higher rates depressed sales opportunities.
good,"•	Analyzed Business Requirement Document and User cases for completeness and testability "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The overall culture of the company was good. There is a feeling that you have to continually look over your shoulder. There is no room for error.
good,"-Obtain loans by email"
good,Prepared meals for customers and handled transactions. Previded a clean work environment. Worked well in a team environment. I learn how to handle all customer transactions and communicate with management.
good,I was not impressed with the company. My managers and coworkers were great
good,"Typical day at work is reviewing inital decision of refinancing loans, i've learned how to be punctional and accurate. Management is very straight forward, and willing to help make you a better worker. Co-workers are good people, the hardest part of the job is the high expectations during cruch time (end of the month), speed and accuracy is very compelling. the most enjoyable part of the job, in the income you earn from hard work."
good,I worked at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage(formerly Wachovia Mortgage) through A & B Personnel. I learned the Loan Processing position and excelled till I was hired full time. A & B staff was great.
good,All about numbers/profit for bank.  Not a relationship bank but transactional.  Good training provided but very cut throat to meet sales numbers.
good,great co workers. this job requires too much cross selling of Wells Fargo products...need to focus more on balancing and customer service.
good,terrible management and advancement opportunities. coworkers were enjoyable to work with. Was nice to be able to listen to music while working.  Objectives and requirements were always changing and never clearly defined.
good,"Learned a lot of banking."
good,"Sales and customer service experience in a fast paced retail-banking environment"
good,I was told I would advance fast but in the end all that happened was I was displaced with no severance or any warning! It really put me in a bad situation financially.
good,"New account maintenance"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job at Wells Fargo was of course getting to work with the customers and genuinely being able to help them succeed financially. The thanks and gratitude coming back from customers was very gratifying. Working in a small town with a big bank I learned how to make every opportunity count because you may not get many in a day. Management was pretty much non- existent at my location having gone through three managers in less than a year. The hardest part of my job was trying to fill 3 different positions at once - store manager, service manager, and teller while trying to break up petty arguments from tellers and trying to coach them to meet the same goals as a store in Chicago has."
good,"It's a good opportunity, but pay is slack and many premier bankers are more knowledgeable than the actual management team."
good,"Great company to work for. They have great benefits, disability insurance, health insurance, vision and dental. Can easily advance but can easily be replaced as well. Somewhat of a stable job."
good,You spend all day on the phones talking to people in foreclosure trying to get in loan documentation to review for modfications. Only about 50% of all applications go through and you are stuck telling customers they will lose there home and need to short sale or deed in lieu on it.
good,Selfish and greedy management is what ruined this one. I watched poor managers get shuffled around from store to store because they knew someone higher up. I also watch many of my highly qualified co-workers who had put in many years to that company get past up for promotions because the district manager didn't like them that much.
good,"Wells offered me $10k under my minimum salary requirement and wouldn't budge. They don't offer sick days. Benefits are the worst I've ever been offered and are very expensive ($550/month minimal coverage, high deductible, for just myself). I was hired to assist two nightmare employees whom no one else wanted to work with. Everyone knew their histories before I arrived. It was the most stressful work experience I've ever had, and although I consider myself resilient to these kinds of people, there is only so much abuse a person can take - especially certain brands of abuse. Neither HR nor my supervisor would support me with this. I was completely on my own. I also realized early on that many Wells employees were frightened of losing their job and that the pressure being put upon them to increase their numbers was getting to them. Lots poker-faces, but when people work in fear, certain dynamics surface (we all know the signs). Yes, there are some employees who have been with Wells for a very long time. The benefits and working environment used to be better from all accounts. Do NOT believe the lip-service about valuing diversity. My co-workers were among the very few bright spots. Wells Fargo is a club. Based upon my experience, it was very costly of my time and talent."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,This is a typical customer service phone desk job. Daily Duties include Making and receiving phone calls and reviewing client profiles.
good,"I enjoyed working direct with clients.  Along with developing new business relationships, a ""consultative"" type selling approach and client satisfaction has been a key to success. "
good,Wells Fargo goes through workers like they are disposable. Any worker with a bit of work ethic that wants to make the best out of their job is praised highly because it is so rare there. I am lucky enough to be in a department that can leave at our end time but there are those not so lucky that have to stay late and work weekends. It is a good starting job to have when looking for other jobs. The pay starting off is not worth the amount of work you do but if you stay around long enough the salary increases and the bonuses are nice. Not a company to stay with for a long amount of time unless you didn't go to college.
good,"I worked in structured environment in the Loss Mitigation Dept."
good,"Great benefits and great co workers most of the managers lack management skills, and ways of how they communicate.  It seems like its not about what you know its about who you know to get any career advancement in Wells Fargo Home Mortgage."
good,not really the best place to work. even when meeting your goals isnt good enough for them.
good,Zero room for much growth and also jobs are moving to the east coast
good,"make 100-150 calls a day."
good,"The benefits and perks you receive with this position are the only things that make the job worth while. Working for this company is extremely stressful. You're constantly working in a cut-throat environment where you MUST make your sales quota. And even after you achieve your goal they raise it once more. You are typically being set up for failure. This company is all about SALES, SALES, SALES. And even when they look at you for a promotion, nothing matters but the numbers you have on paper. Management is also very poor. They would much rather nag and use fear to push the team than motivation. I've had a very poor experience and since I've been with the company."
good,"Position responsible for reviewing, analyzing, approving and processing moderate individual consumer requests and products within company and industry guidelines. Evaluating and ensuring overall loan documents are accurate, complete, and compliant; reviewing of financial statements, credit reports, applicable ratios (i.e. Debt ratios, loan-to-value) and other supporting documentation. Contacting customers and partners to gather information to make complete package for underwriting."
good,Management and coworkers were helpful.  Good team environment.
good,Assisted customer with there billing and making payment on the car loans
good,The first year I had an amazing learning experience. I currently go in to work and plan my day with the tellers i will have working. Set business goals for them and congratulate them on any current developments achieved for all. I coach/train through-out the day while also performing transactions for customers. I complete operational task in and out through-out the day as well. The hardest part of the job is not having a manager to support me and learn any of our systems or products to help others in the development process. I am the designated person in charge of all sales and performance for tellers and operations for branch. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting people and learning through my own efforts with any obstacles that come up.
good,"I have been with this company for many years, 10 plus. its a financial institution and of course depending on the market it can go up and down"
good,"Underwriting 8-10 files a day"
good,Wells Fargo doesnt care about their employees. they care currently cleaning house and letting go of alot of ppl. be care about making the decision to work there.
good,"I didn't like the attitude of my manager, he couldn't multitask and his temper would get the best of him. The sales were a bit crazy and unethical. Selling credit cards to people who didn't even qualify for them. Anything to get numbers, the way they were selling was not right for me. Always short staffed and had to take on a workload of three people just to make up for the shortage."
good,"Sales position where you will learn the benefits of team work and how to develop a comfort morale from team building. Provides beneficial ""corporate"" experiences and how to build ""self"" knowledge on an advantage in a field of sales. Definite position to be in to give yourself an edge on experience, not for the faint heart."
good,"My day usually started very early 6 to 7 in the morning, I was never the type to sit or socialize first thing. The day normally very busy, so when I commuted I would visualize my day and prioritize in my mind what was most important or time sensitive that must be done first. When I arrived at the office I would start my work. Once "
good,"In my two years of working with the company, I've gained a lot of knowledge and experience to take with me in the next career I will have. My co-workers in general were great and a pleasure to work with but management however was not great at all. In the two years of being with the company, I've seen 9 store and service managers come and go. And with new management, it was always different rules and more stress to have. And as far as promotion goes, it was more of management choosing who they wanted to promoted rather than their experience. The policy was you have to be in your current role for at least a year. But the last few people who were promoted in the company were only in the roles for 2-3 months, basically they promoted who they wanted as well despite their experience in sales, retails or education."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Cross-sell bank services and products and provide bank services to a diverse customer base. "
good,Decent corporation but the feeling that you matter as an employee was lost after the merger. They took away family care time which was an additional 40 hrs of PTO just to care for family members. We had all federal holidays. Now we have to come to work even when the Fed is closed. They also took 1 PTO day to cover MLK holiday because Wells Fargo did not provide that to their employees. They eliminated performance bonuses and the yearly raise is nominal. If you happen to be hired for a job that pays much higher than you current position they will only increase you salary by 10% of your current salary. we had yearly 48 hrs of community service time but Wells reduced that to 16 a year.  
good,"It's a great job, have job security, but do not get paid enough for what I do. Work long hours - most of the time 6 days a week to keep up with my duties with help from coworkers."
good,"Wells Fargo is great for the person satisfied with only make 32k/yr.  It is very difficult to reach a pay out.  And when you do, it is less than 1k for a quarter of a year of work.  Also, Wells Fargo will expect you to get a perfect score on every secret shop you get.  Any score that is not perfect is a FAIL.  You become subject to termination after more than 2 FAILS.  It is crazy.  I would not reccomend this Banker role to anyone,  However, there are other roles that many would rather work in.  Wells can be some place to grow, just not in the Banker role."
good,"If the former CEO and powers that be knew that their decision to buy a sub-prime mortgage company would sink a proud and profitable company, I wonder if they still would have made it?  Most of the good managers under Wachovia were either let go or demoted to other positions.  I say 'good managers' meaning the ones that actually took the time to care about you and had a legitimate interest in your career.  Current management is of the ""Do it or your fired"" mentality.  If you make your ridiculous sales numbers, then they accept you.  No praise other than the obligatory ""Good job, now get more next month.""  If you don't, then it's a 'Work Up or Work Out' system.  Negative reinforcement is standard.  Now, that may not hold true for the Western Divisions, but if you are stuck working under a former First Union (prior bank) upper manager, then your best hope is that they deem you worthy to keep.  "
good,lower pay. it was fine.  learned alot about investment management. co-workers were fine. 
good,This is an okay place to work. I would recommend it to people interested in home mortgages.
good,This position involves answering telephone calls from current Wells Fargo customers currently delinquent on there mortgages. Customers are on the verge of foreclosure. Your job is to develop relationships with the customers and work out a plan in order to get current on there mortgage debt.
good,High and very stressful sales goals. Didn't like started each morning speaking about numbers rather than customer service. Drove 45 minutes one way for work and was unable to transfer to a closer store. Decent pay. 
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work, however, I wish contractors were acknowledge for being a part of the organazation as well."
good,"Call Center environment. Very structured, no freedom. A typical day at work was being on the phone for 7.5 hours. Not great for one's health to sit for that long of a time."
good,I love what I do but I wish they appreciate their employees more.
good,"A typical day at Wachovia started with the morning huddles the purpose of these huddles at the time was to gain sales commitments for the day from each employee and to motivate them as well. When I was at Wachovia the economy was taking a turn, banks were closing down or being bought out, customers were taking out all their monies and keeping it at home. Our goal was to retain customers and that was my responsibility as a Financial Center Manager. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I bought lunch for my employees and or goodies for our customers, everyone appreciated this. Eventually I had to leave as my position was eliminated due to Wells Fargo buying out Wachovia. There were 2 Wells branches near by thus my branch would eventually close down."
good,Interesting place to work. Learn how to understand mortgages and learn how to excute paperwork to process a forclosure. A production environment.
good,"High Turnover, Numbers, numbers, numbers, impossible goals, decent incentive if you can reach the goals, non-compassionate management."
good,The call center is a very busy place and management is not in place like they should be. Many issues that requires calls to be escalated are lengthy because you have to wait on a supervisor who is most of the time unavailable.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Things were very unorganized and too much was asked of the the employees.
good,"Co-workers were the best part of the job. I have worked from Oakland to Walnut Creek, Concord to San Francisco and it was never a dull moment with the co-workers due to ethnicity, culture, food and fun. Days consisted of clerical work, data entry, accounting, fundraising and staff meetings. The hardest part of the job was the layoff and trying to find employment within prior to layoff date."
good,it was a good experience they just need to adjust some rules dealing with attendance
good,Warm calls/conference calls
good,made/recv inbound/outbound calls to collect mortgage payments over the phone. We also had fun contest to keep us motivated. As a whole deparment we had a monthly goal to obtain.
good,"I will gladly share my experiences out loud, but not through a website."
good,"a typical day at work would be helping customerst with their financial needs, transactions, meet schdule apointments, calling business customers and personal account holder that you have not spoken to in awhile."
good,The environment is setup in a way that quantity is valued over quality. I believe that there needs to be a balance of both and that mentality needs to be embraced from the top down. Production is recognition in this work environment. Opportunity for advancement is provided to those who produce.
good,Typical work day consisted of speaking with both current and prospective Wells Fargo customers in order to market banking products and services. Made both inbound and outbound sales calls. Spoke with customers in a call-center environment. Management can be very short and forthcoming if a banker is not meeting the required sales metrics. Most difficult part of the job had to be closing loans due to strict credit requirements. Most enjoyable part of the job was assisting those who needed help (i.e. money for a new car).
good,"I believe i didnt have the best of experiences here at Wellsfargo due to the lack of Management, therefore i would like to not say anything about it. Although i did have good co workers."
good,A typical day would consist of building relationships with clients and helping with financial picture. I learned how interest rates actually can help you broaden your financial picture.
good,Phone Calls on Clients account information.
good,Its a job. They really do not value most of the employees. They feel anyone can do the job and therefore do not pay very well.
good,"Training is a blast (6 weeks). Once you are on the floor, you must be on the phones at all times unless it is you designated break period in which you are unofficially expected to review products/services. Management is unsupportive, and the turnover rate is significantly high. It is hard to get to know co-workers because break periods are predetermined so you can only get to know those that log off the phones when they aren't suppose to or talk while a customer is on hold. The most enjoyable part of the job is chatting with people while walking out the building about job searches."
good,"The culture is great, the leadership could be worked on however the team members go out of their way to ensure customers have a great experience"
good,took calls all day assising customers with credit card bills and stamements payments and balance transfers
good,"I love working for Wells Fargo, But getting along with the management is a very hard task. I really think that they brain wash the Branch managers and service managers. Its really crazy how they act"
good,"Work with a great team, we create and update our teams policy and procedures routinely. We also routinely evaluate and make changes where necessary to our departments frequently used forms. With the ever changing regulatory changes, we work to ensure all of the changes are communicated to the field and are implemented accurately."
good,"My day is typically very busy with a lot of different responsibilities. The people I work with are smart and dedicated. Being new to benefit accounting I have learned a lot over the last 4+ years, i.e. organizing annual audits, improving work processes and communicating effectively with a wide variety of people. The hardest part of my job is organizing the daily and monthly responsibilities and meeting ever increasing deadlines. The most enjoyable part of my day is the people I work with."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I learned how to train other employees and learn how to buy cash for the bank facility. Getting to know and creating personable conversations with customers getting to know them.
good,"The company was a joke making women hold your bladders would not allow you to use the bathroom unless it was your scheduled break or you would be written up. The favoritism was unreal not how well you could do your job but how well you could fit in on a social level. Also promotions were based upon there same criteria how popular you were not how well you could perform your job on a Customer Service Experience. Was encouraged to think outside the box however when the team members did they were scrutinized and talked to about this.. The only positive part of this job was to assist the customers with there banking needs and to help them find solutions, however when you did this with stellar customer service which could take time with the customers, you were written up because Wells Fargo is all about how fast you could get the customer on and off the phone. Always wanting us to sell the customer a product a service.. And when you took the extra time to help resolve the customers issue you were than in jeopardy for being written up for your handle time. I learned that in my next job it would be quality customer service that i would commit to the customer. And educate the customer not force a unneeded product or service down the throats of customers who were talked into unnecessary products increasing wells Fargo's financial position to satisfy the demands of there stock holders. The employees were just a number. You were always encouraged to volunteer your time and i mean volunteer your time for projects outside of Wells Fargo and never recognized for the time you took out of your"
good,"On a typical day you are expected to open 2 to 3 checking acct packages and provide a total of 12 to 15 solutions a day. Solutions are a checking acct, a debit card, etc..."
good,"typical day: enter bank, secure area, let in 2nd half of opening team member. Do night drop deposit pull and record deposits received in duel control. Divide up deposits to be worked by tellers. Open safe deposit box vault and set it to day use. Go to team meeting. Retrieve teller cash drawer and go to day's assigned station. Try to finish night deposits prior to bank being opened to public. After bank is opened assist bank customers with their transactions and concerns. Look for cross sell opportunities to meet sales goals while giving the customer in front of you great service. At end of day, balance cash drawer, sort work correctly to be processed. Assist with Vault balancing and holdbag deposits to be processed off site. Make sure everything is put up and secured. Set security alarm and leave so you can come back in and do it all over again."
good,"Very busy work environment, dealing with many customers. I learned quite a bit about finances and the salaries of various jobs. Management was great at that time. Co-workers were just fine. Hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers who always thought you could or would take their money. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with repeat customers."
good,Typically arrive an hour before the branch is opened. Process night deposits and other opening procedures. I learned to multi-task more efficiently due to the demand of managers and clients. Management seemed disconnected from the employees. Communication lacked between managers and also between managers and employees. My co-workers were very pleasant and worked with each other to complete daily tasks. The hardest part of the job would be maintaing composure and efficiency when the job became more demanding. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and helping them solve their financial issues.
good,"On a typical day, there are a lot of people doing banking at our branch. You can meet different people from different backgrounds."
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to start with on a personal level skills for customer service. Their benefits are good. The values are good and advancement is very possible. Overall i would say its a great place to start with.
good,I loved this job except for the sales portion. I wanted a customer service only position.
good,Fortune 500 company. I put all my efforts in and love what I do.
good,Jam Packed Day with high call volume phone calls from irate borrowers in Forclosure and Bankruptcy. Majority of the clientel are borrowers in default not able to recieve assistance from the bank for loan modificactions. Many Customer are not able to make contact with there single point or contact during review for loan modification for assistance of home retainment. My initial contact with the borrower was to do my best to seek resolution for borrowers who seemed to be treated unfairly due to the status of there loans and make an attmept to reach out to there contact for assistance in regards to there defaulted loan.
good,was a courie went to banking center to collect mail.Work for a couple years.
good,There is alot of sales involved with my position. They want you to sell the customer every product and are constantly asking us about our numbers. There isnt any encouragement or rewards.
good,They are a okay company to work but they dont know how to appreciate there employees
good,this place is good for college students but not for a long term career
good,The branches I worked with were all wonderful. Management for my particular department very difficult to work with; no understanding or care with the passing of a loved one.
good,"The company has a well known vision, customers full financial success."
good,"Wells Fargo is good company to work for. However, the management in my department needed much improvement. Wells Fargo's mission statement stands for integrity and core values. The department that I worked in didn't have advancement which was very much needed at the time."
good,One of the best place to work if you are passionate about customer service. The company made giving awesome service a culture for all. Everyone was tied to giving outstanding service because it was a requirement.
good,"wells fargo at large is a god company. Though there are numerous things i would like to see changed at my branch, overal my work experience there has been rewarding."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Major wirehouse where client and advisor was second to profits and product.
good,I liked working at Wells Fargo but the management was pressuring at sales. They wanted you to pressure customers into getting things they wouldn't use or benefit from.
good,"The amount of pressure and stress placed on employees is not worth the pay. It is a great bank, however there are surveys and if you do not receive all 5's (even one 4) you will be penalized"
good,"Wells Fargo is a huge corporate financial institution with high expectations on sales for company growth. High turnover rate, aggressive sales goals in stressful environments."
good,"The pay is decent for a call center environment, could it be higher?  Yes it could.  My biggest problem was that I was lead to believe I could advance quickly and that has so far not happened in my almost three years of being there, the only ""advancement"" I received was phone banker II which is pretty much guaranteed unless you quit or get fired.  Now I'm at a point where I feel like I personally have hit a ceiling and will not be going anywhere from here."
good,"The people are great and the benefits and pretty good, but the pay is low. The push hard for commission based on performance.Between that and the government regulations it felt like you could be fired any day, ether for performance or a customer misinterpreting what you said."
good,A overall decent company to work for. I enjoyed my time there. Competitive environment worked every other Saturday. Competitive starting pay and loves to hire from the outside of the company.
good,"enjoyed volunteer events, did not like sales goals, got tired of hearing about the WF scandal and constantly having to explain that not everyone at WF is out to rip someone off"
good,"Management made it stressful. Work meeting were fun but most people that are there before you, think they are better than you. Had nightmares after this job. Pay is ok."
good,"Wells Fargo has so many problems, it's an easy target for criticism.  On a positive note, however, they are trying.  The people that I worked with were high quality.  The challenges they face, however, are daunting.  It begins with management and a silo structure that will not yield the kind of innovation necessary.  At one point, I was reporting to five different individuals and has very little to do!  Nice people, though."
good,"The overall culture sought after is the employee feels valued, the customer experience is the refocus, and Diversity with Inclusiveness is the mantra among the employees."
good,"Everyday we were pushed to sell products to our customers such as new accounts, credit cards and loans. Most of the time the customers didn't need these products but we were pressured to do so to meet quotas. I loved the people I worked with, we were like family and my boss was amazing. He was very compassionate and understanding and always had an open door policy."
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for but at the current time working with them their sales goals where unethical and management took a “by any means necessary” approach to meeting sales goals
good,"none at this time. nice people , lots of areas to work in . nothing else to say really.  Nice building state of the art. a place where you learn if you put in your time.."
good,Management support is lacking as well as consistent communication. The lack of support is the most frustrating and I am not able to depend on my manager for timely response or accurate information
good,"Derpending on location, branch can be slow or hectic. its really important to  have a positive attitude and be able to deal with crazies. overall great company to work at. have excellent opportunities for growth"
good,"In the five years I have been there, I have had 4 branch managers and 9 teller managers...that is not including the amount of time when the branch had either no branch manager or teller manager."
good,when I relocated with the company nothing was in my favor I worked within the company for seven years and when I moved away and wanted to stay with the company I had to take almost a 30k dollar pay cut because they would not take into consideration my years already within the company.
good,"Very high volume location and company. The amount of ""customer service"" they seek from employees are very high. Management is very aggressive when it comes to each client/ customer you assist."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Depending on where you work at Wells Fargo, you could either be in a great environment or the worst. There is no room for work/family balance when you first start out,"
good,Wells Fargo is hard to work for. With all the sales malpractices it has made employees lives difficult with new BAU processes put in place. They were not willing to hire additional people to support the new BAU process.
good,"When you work for a company for over four years and feel like you mean nothing to the company, that's Wells Fargo way. When i first started I felt like I was a valuable employee but the more I saw was that they definitely did not."
good,They have a lot of good aspects to them on paper. They try to be inclusive and they have policies to try to make WF a good place to work. Sadly it all depends on the management. With the recent lawsuit they are forced to make a lot of changes however those in positions of leadership are the same people that allowed the practices that lead to the lawsuit.
good,It is an alright experience working for Wells Fargo. I think the best thing with the company is being able to volunteer and give back to the community and sometimes get paid for it (Up to 16 hours).
good,"A typical day at work. there was not exciment in the office need more dinamic in the office for the mortgage channel However, working in the retail bank it was more fun engaging."
good,"Has the potential to be a great working environment but often falls short. Best if you work at a location with an understanding and motivational Branch manager. However, depending on the area, this can be a difficult task to accomplish."
good,Managers sit around doing nothing and don’t really know how to do anything but take conference calls and give rude people want they want so they go away
good,Was great but the departments do not know how to communicate with one another when we do certain processes. Did not like one of the managers because he didn't know how to be a manager.
good,"The job was very easy, management is very rude and act like they are better then everyone, very strict on dress code with new people. If you make a mistake some mangers have a complete melt down."
good,Execs made decisions to let staff go. It affected the work atmosphere and made it difficult to perform the job function. Laid off sales support staff and it increased turn times and we missed close dates and it negatively effected our customers
good,If you find the right manager who can take you with them it's a good place to work. Otherwise it's a pretty stagnant environment to advance your career.
good,"Wells Fargo's environment and mission was opposite for many years. lead to disengagement with poor leadership. however job description was enjoyable, and compensation was extremely competative"
good,"The culture has shifted based on executive leadership however there are opportunities to strengthen skills. The compliance space has become more defined and aligns to independent oversight, accountability and ""raise your hand"" if you see a potential risk."
good,"Fast pace environment, not a lot of down time. Made to feel like a number on a paper not a name or face; no team atmosphere. Work life balance is not good with the hours we work. Benefits and pay are best in the industry which makes it hard to leave. Everything else besides pay and benefits is sub par."
good,"I worked with a few departments and had a lot of fun with some of them. I would highly recommend the Compliance Advertising Review Marketing department, they were incredible"
good,"The third and second floor of the building are like oil and water, second floor is miserable to work in with the rules they follow and the managers I've experienced there, third floor is actually not bad, great managers, but there have been changes that are making it hard to work there recently, counterproductive changes that only make it harder to do your job. They are not flexible at all for schedules and unless you try to bid for one when they have it open, you basically will never get to change, essentially stuck with what they give you"
good,"This specific Wells Fargo was really busy at all times but that was no problem. Due to recent incidents of getting sued in California there was a mass email sent out to stop sales and focus on customer experience. However, my service manager at the time did not comply with this and proceeded with her ill mannered ways of pressuring sale goals onto the staff."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"It was a nice and relaxing working environment overall. But when the economy crashed back in 2009, 25% of the employees had to go. They don't prepare you for that."
good,One of the great financial institution to work with. We can learn many things related to banking. good number of leaders. Like the culture and ethics at workplace.
good,"the roanoke area is bad enough as it is...but the culture in this particular center is beyond me. I don't understand it very much. The training was a class of about 20, the trainer hadn't been on the phone in over 10 years, the class was disruptive and rude with the trainer simply ignoring it.This kept me from actually learning what I needed to know for the job. The job itself is literally one call after the other, over and over. It's not all difficult, but more draining. Breaks are too short. The support from management can be amazing if you start off on the right foot...if you don't you'll need to watch out. There are amazing benefits, discounts, paid time for volunteering...its just not the place for me. I like to be left alone. Being a quiet outcast there can be crushing. I recommend it still."
good,"Wells Fargo is a standard corporate environment. As a financial services company it is heavily regulated with the associated paperwork and processes. The only real negative was constant, extreme re-organizations, which made it difficult to maintain long-term strategies."
good,"Good benefit , kind of stress place to work at , management not always fair with schedules, paid consider good with annually raise , "
good,"The people were really good to work with, and the job wast to hard it was just way to many calls coming in and going out so i ended up leaving the company."
good,"I worked as a salesforce admin, it was a nice experience working with them. Maintaining the product application and following the daily baised tasks, working according to the requirement provided."
good,"Not a whole lot of controls in place to mitigate the risks and issues we uncover. The management team's are different in culture and it seems as if most do not follow the same protocol.  Instead of looking for solutions, they more so put band-aids on the problems that we bring to their attention."
good,"Work life balance challenging; fair compensation, changing environment and culture; opportunities for training and variety of work experiences; some travel"
good,"Not willing to change or be open to new ideas"
good,"Currently at a slow branch so can be boring at times"
good,"Wells Fargo was not a bad place to work, but the supervisor at our branch was sub-par. They were erratic, poorly behaved, and we barely got our schedule for the next week 24 hours in advance which made it very difficult to make plans or appointments."
good,"Wells Fargo was a good place to work but there is very little room for creativity, participation and advancement. Based on the experience I had the role was restrictive in that I had to perform it in an exact way, without receiving training or instruction in regards to the specifics, I had to feel my way into the specifics, while making mistakes."
good,"I've worked with some really fantastic individuals, but overall the workplace feel is really not for me. I don't feel truly supported in my development and advancement."
good,"El Banco es grande, poco crecimiento profesional, dia de trabajo es con mucha ocupacion"
good,"They treat you very poorly. They are always being fined."
good,Starting out its great but the wear on ya makes most people quit... if you can some how last a year and transfer to a new position it’s good but phone banking isn’t a long term move
good,Wellsfargo had really high sales goals and at the time put the sale before the customer. Individuals who didnt need anything were forced into products due to Wellsfargo's sales goals. Management was also a club you could only get into by cheating your way into it or because you knew someone that could get you in to the club.
good,"Wells Fargo is a good company to work for, but they are a culture that is embedded with micro management with very less opportunities to move to corporate. Much focus was on selling products to customers, which was a little far fetched and unrealistic. The benefits they offer are very good compared to many other places, if given a chance, I would definitely work there again without the micro-management."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The department I worked in had just had a major reduction in pay by eliminating commission .Moral was awful including Management "
good,"Manager are not true manager, but instead are employees that have been there the longest and have no experience managing and developing others. Majority of career advancement opportunities are given in a manner of an “old boy” system and minorities are mostly left out."
good,The gaming and unethical culture of Wells Fargo is ultimately why I left. The management and leadership was great and the sales training was top notch.
good,Not a bad place but negative employees do have a strong presence. It is hard to overcome the negativity once it spreads. I would say that pay could be better as well.
good,"The work was easy to comprehend and complete. The expectations of Management was stressful. Despite stressful environment, workers were pleasant and fun to work with."
good,"I did not enjoy the work environment. A lot of bickering & complaining. "
good,"A lot of good people work there, however the overall culture is challenged.  Gradual progress is being made to fix what is broken, however discretionary spending on projects to improve the business and client / customer experience is a void currently."
good,"Overall the company is trying to make changes in a way in the ever changing job market to keep up with regulations, customer demands and competition but seems to be falling behind for its workers in retail banking"
good,"I worked for them twice, they laid me off and then invited me to apply and when I went back they laid me off again.  Upper management is uninvolved with the day to day and new employees receive little to no training"
good,"the benefits are amazing, the call center works Monday to Sundays util 12 A.M from Monday to Friday, Saturdays gets super busy back to back calls non stop. Customers can be rude, and the Q&A will take the two starts reviews despite the fact that you were following policies and procedures and protecting the bank assets, the management was very poor people who went promoted because seniority or the were able to keep around for long. However, their leadership and professionalism was none. Good place for college students and beginners."
good,Good facilities and they provide shuttle service to employees.  Actively promotes health and wellness of employees.  Provides good training.  Generous in giving incentives for recruitment.
good,Your experience will be dictated by your manager. A job here is a roll of the dice depending on what kind of manager you have. The work is usually repetitive and can go from very little to a lot quickly.
good,Good company to start with but won't be compensated for skills unless you were to leave and come back. Company provides great benefits but on the lower side of the pay side. A lot of transition currently with higher up management and executives. Good opportunity to network and grow skills in any field.
good,"Is a good place to practice your skills, since the customer's situation are never the same, customers always leave satisfied with their financial solution, the locations are great you never can go to a different city or state and do not notice a Wells Fargo, their online banking is always renovating to make your life easy"
good,Gained a lot of experience with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. I received Great on the job training and very informative information regarding my position
good,"Working at Wells Fargo would be an excellent environment if the management was properly done. When you don’t enjoy being at work because of management, that is an issue."
good,Only thing I didn’t like about working at Wells Fargo was employees were not treated equally. Their was tons of favoritism and talking to upper management about it just made it worse.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Standard corporate environment with fair pay and benefits.  Inconsistent communication from leadership around goals and business progress, on a business unit level."
good,"everything you expect out of a Big Corporation. CUstomer Service is pretty good. new culture is btter than the old culture of sales. they are trying but have a long way to go. Work/personal life balance could be better. If you get hired as a Service MAnager, you can bet that you will be a teller most of the time."
good,"Once I was a top producer at Wells Fargo bringing in over 100 k a month with their collections industry. Then they quit caring, now you can bring in 1 million or 1 dollar and they wont care. All that they want now is a body to fill a seat. They only hire their friends usually you have to really, really butter up with the bosses. There is no personal development here of any kind, the work is boring, and the phrase when given is cheep, if ever given. Along with an over zealous politically correct culture."
good,"Management was good, provided quiet working conditions, and allowed a healthy work life balance to employees. Training could be better due to no formal training."
good,"Working at Wells Fargo was easy enough. The problem is your work life will vary depending on your manager. The job I had was easy and laid back for the most part, but my manager had 0 experience doing the actual job. Despite having little to no clue how to perform our daily tasks, she micromanaged heavily and was critical of our work. She was also fairly strict on her own rules but never followed them herself. The benefits were fairly good. It's not the worst place in the world to work, just not the best."
good,"I really enjoyed working for wells fargo i gain alot of experience, but the managers needed to be more supportive. I felt that i was being discriminated by my mánager."
good,Wells Fargo's a good company to work for if you want to be pushing something on someone that they don't necessarily need. You'll have someone over your shoulder harping at you about how long you're on the phone with a customer and then that same person will hard but you that that you're not providing enough options for the customer
good,"Upper management needs revamping. The company itself needs to show they care about the employees. Not much room to grow unless you have connections. "
good,"I was recruited heavily to come aboard.  Once I joined, the details of the opportunity were vastly overstated.  I asked for a change in territory but I was pigeon holed into the location I was hired for based primarily factors that have no business in a corporate environment"
good,"Very competitive culture. Tons of Favoritism. But overall a great experience, gave me my first real world experience working for a corporation. Definitely start off as a teller and work your way up if you wish to go into management."
good,Acceptable place to work only if you get a good management team which is hard to find in mortgages. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage (WFHM) has consolidated from over 20 mortgage centers in the USA to less than 10 so there have been many closures and layoffs over the years. Lots of management changes and working conditions are not great. WFHM is a very good place to get a mortgage as they are honest and competitive but they have a long ways to go before considered a good place to work in mortgages.
good,The company might be decent but the department isnt what you wpuld assume. Training was not professionan and work wad not praised only repremanded for errors.
good,"The work is good. Most of the co-workers are friendly.  The only thing that draws me  back is that some managers like to ""micro-manage,"" their group or others being strict on break / lunches times."
good,"I was quite excited when I started at Wells Fargo. I liked my team, especially my supervisor. This remained true despite significant changes to my team. Throughout my year here, I was lead to believe there was a high chance of me going permanent. Everyone seemed to like me, and I was doing a good job. As it turns out, I do not meet the required prior industry experience for full-time hire. In order for me to become a permanent employee now, I'd have to actually take a pay cut from my contract hourly wage to my future salary. So I'm leaving soon. I just wish I hadn't wasted time here I could have spent elsewhere. The onsite managers have been great, though a little muddled in their communication of these required qualifications for permanent employees. And at the end of the day, no one I interacted with had any say in final hiring decisions. The disconnect between upper management and day-to-day employees is apparent."
good,"this an productive, fast pace environment.  workplace culture is good. hardest part of this job was not being able to leave until the phone que were empty"
good,"It had a lot of perks, it was a fun place to work, but it mostly depended on location."
good,"Fun at Workplace and Very productive in work. Management is good and working environment is good as its banking industry. Ambience is good. "
good,"I don't believe  there is any corporate culture. not sure why people stay there for years. maybe it is the job security. it is no fun to work there.very heavy culture , slow , politics."
good,"A lot of big companies like "
good,"Wells Fargo is such a large company that it is difficult to speak to the culture of the entire company.  However, home lending was a satisfactory place to work."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Be ready for things to constantly change in the workplace. If you aren't a fan of change. Wells Fargo is not the place for you. Career advancement is attainable. You choose your career path and your manager coaches you toward that.
good,"The company is all about WHO you know and not WHAT you know. Unethical practices are still occurring all while employees attempt to learn new new processes and procedures. Managers go behind emplyees backs to verify they are failing and make sure to point out every flaw rather than to help employees work on them instead. The advavancement of the company is wonderful, but the constant micromanagement and unethical work environments make it a VERY hard place to work unless you enjoy what you do. Their diversity programs are amazing but they recently overhauled them completely and removed a lot of very important and necessary programs employees could've benefited from. They're more about listening to the managers and corporate lenders than about what the customers or employees want."
good,Fun environment competitive friendly not too micromanagement like other companies but that could depend on your supervisor or management some could be strict for no good reason
good,"My review is very specific to my local branch and does not represent WF as a whole. My branch had very difficult customers and management that did not support employees. This lead to a very negative work environment, which is my main reason for the bad review. The customers also play a strong factor is this job not being enjoyable, as they are constantly screaming and yelling about things out of your control."
good,"Great company with many benefits such as healthcare, dental, vision and paid time off. 401K is matched at a great percentage rate. Management differs in the different areas of Wells Fargo. "
good,"stay away from the front end of the business with Wells Fargo for long term, but new to the industry great opportunity with solid training.  Great benefits"
good,I started working their because I was going to school and needed a job while I was going to school.  It is a great place when you need to work and pay the bills.
good,"Not bad a good entry level fulltime job, good customers pretty good training, management can be aggressive and non supportive depending on the branch, tend to promote to assistant quickly but sloe in promoting to managing your own branch"
good,Most managers are prejudice & chose weaker candidates over stronger ones for a position. Why post a position if intentions are to hire someone already
good,"Job was very stressful. Managers on top of manager; meetings all of the time; nobody every got anything done? But overall, a nice place to work until they moved the operation to Florida and let everyone go....go figure???"
good,Management could be a little more in touch with their people management skill. The outside of the company is a totally different picture of what the actual inside is operating.
good,"My recent Manager at Wells Fargo is bias, she isn't suitable to be a manager because she is not professional. She doesn't raise you according to your work performances but according to her favoritism."
good,Production driven over quality. The company originally was focused on doing the best we could on each loan but then became more of fast and faster processing while sacrificing quality. Once they started hiring overseas in India it got worse. Now they hire more there and lay off domestic workers.
good,"An ever changing dynamic environment with a supportive, cohesive team. I had really good team coordination and relationships across the entire project teams."
good,"Transition Team very bad, not motivational and just used treat tactics. Unreasonable goals. The management team after training was rude and judgmental.  Instead of creating team spirit, they talked about team members in meetings in a negative manner.  Wished I never loft credit cards services to fraud."
good,"I devote much of my day having in-depth conversations, in person and by phone with my customers to manage their financial needs. My daily projects include: building and managing lifelong customer relationships, understanding customer’s financial needs and showing them how to get the greatest possible value from the appropriate recommendations, developing and maintaining relationships with Wells Fargo partners to maximize opportunities."
good,"I am a full-time telecommuter and have worked across 11 different teams.  I have worked across several administration areas including firewall maintenance, OS compliance and remediation, and web server maintenance.  Department reorganizations are frequent so I have had many managers, some more involved than others in advocating for their employees.  The company has seen some tough times in recent years and much chaos as a result.  That has made it difficult to make lasting contributions, feel solidly in position, and challenging in making long-term working relationships.  Creating and deploying quick and effective solutions in emergency compliance/vulnerability situations, and working as a team, is the most enjoyable aspect of the job.  Many talented people work there but are often not included in decision making.  Telecommuting has been a great benefit but that is largely being stripped away and is rarely available for new hires or those seeking a new position on their own within the company."
good,"Closed down insurance department after it was uncovered bankers were opening fake accounts. Was a good department to work in at the time, however compensation structure changed frequently."
good,"While I enjoyed most of the people I worked with, the job was stressful and management wasn't the best.  Also, they said there were no sales goals, however they still had us push sales and accounts, even when it was obvious customers didn't like hearing about these things."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"New LOB to San Antonio. Still working out lots of small details. Very customer focused. Not much opportunity to advance although you are told there is. It is very much a numbers game. Micro managed on your calls. Time on the call, hold time, etc"
good,The only thing with Wells  Fargo I worked there for about 3 and half years and was let go with no severance pay. I knew employees there for less than a year who was offered 6 months severance pay
good,Placing and receiving phone calls from customers and other team members to assist with the servicing of home mortgages. Complying with federal and state regulations when it comes to procedures and guidelines. Meeting expected metrics and stats for your role.
good,"Good place to work.   I have to be honest, I had talked to a lot of people who absolutely would not work at Wells Fargo.  I found it to be a good place to work."
good,Follows a good way to assess people and pays for performance. Clearly calls out the areas of improvement and helps understanding them and move forward in improving those competencies for a win-win situation.
good,"Only company that prefers to promote within, however only to keep from competiting with salaries from outside companies. Benefits are ok, but salary is significantly lower than other banks for experienced employees"
good,Multiple times in the last 10 years I saw departments gutted with layoffs of 50% or more of the staff being let go.  The insecurity of positions within the company causes stress for employees.
good,"Not very innovative, long standing team members set in their ways.  Very hard to introduce change via new ideas.  Many approvals required before getting anything moving."
good,"Good work life balance"
good,It’s a easy job being a teller but i was a commercial teller which means over worked and under paid . The commercial tellers do the most work and Wells Fargo always is low on staff so i was also doing work of a lead teller but they wouldn’t allow me to apply for the lead position yet . I felt unappreciated so i left for better opportunities. Not to mention all the drama . I stay to myself but it was a lot of drama especially the managers !!!!! If you call out for personal reasons they tell all your business to the entire staff like nothing is confedential . It feels like a disfubfriobal family you want to get away from . And the customers treat you like ish.
good,"Good place to work, management was always there to help with any questions or concerns."
good,"Great teams, unclear priorities, and lots of opportunities to grow if you are willing to be flexible. Hardest part of the job is maintaining course to drive change."
good,Overall a good company to work for. The company is dedicated to improving business practices and core vision and values. I also appreciate their commitment to diversity and community service.
good,Like all businesses there is good and bad. The compensation is better than the other jobs I have had. Though I do not like how they categorize their jobs. Banking doesn't know how to work with creatives. It is all facts and figures.
good,"The salary is low for job function."
good,"Commercial banking team and commercial real estate banking team in McLean, VA are great teams.  Retail senior management in McLean, VA and Baltimore, MD are ruthless."
good,With all issues WF is been having the last 2 years many changes have ocurred that makes it challenging for employees to follow proper procedures. Culture continues evolving
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I have been working for wells fargo for about 4 years now and the reason I have to leave this job is because I relocated and unfortunately wells fargo is probably the only company (that I know of) that does not honor transfers for its employees. Apparently I have to have a medical condition to be accommodated close to home. Annual raises are peanuts. Bonuses are peanuts. I am a lead teller with supervisory responsibilities and a banker makes more money than I do. Very unfair.
good,"You had to make sure every transaction we process, whether it was redemptions, exchanges, or adjusting trades. Everything had to be processed by closing of the stock market."
good,Team members are a pleasure to work with.  Middle Management tends to look down at people below them.  Especially if you were from a company that Wells Fargo acquired.
good,"The pay is NOT competitive, you will make 30% more working at a competitor, the job security is good, but advancement is based on social connections, which I do not prefer."
good,"I was a teller, commercial teller, and then a lead teller. I was up for 2  Service Manager Positions in other states and they basically stopped me from interviewing for this because they said my tellers looked up to me and they did not like that I was applying for jobs elsewhere."
good,"There were many changes that took place in 2017/2018.  Minimum productions standards increased, along with more pressure to attend meetings, account for every hour of each day.  Too many changes to discuss in writing."
good,Busy day depends on the days of the month. First and end of month super busy. I honestly just work on customer service skills. I don’t like my management they had favorites. The culture was very diverse.
good,"Its an environment where some take it as a job, others take it as a career. Its really a matter of your goals and perspective. I've seen people move up, and I've also seen qualified people passed over. The culture of the entire industry is changing, as banking is shifting from brick and mortar to more online resources. If you need a quick buck and a literal 9-5, then this is a good fit. If you want a culture that promotes growth and development, maybe this isn't for you."
good,All the people do there fuss and complain about leaving . The job is honestly full of drama and I will never go back. I honestly didn’t want to go back after the first week because of how bad it was but I got through it. The manager was rude and was somewhat racist .
good,I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo for many years until a merger with a company whose cultuer was much more cut throat and teamwork was not espoused as a true corporate value.  The individual performers were rewarded and promoted in such a way that it deterred team collaboration.
good,I have been with this firm for almost 20 years so I have a lot of experience in the finance business.  I have had many jobs from working in a brokerage branch to travelling the world to working in the backoffice supporting the Financial Advisors.
good,"The customer were great to work with I  really love to make someone"
good,"Sales goals are gone, woo-hoo. Your performance metric is now customer service surveys which managers will emphasize because their pay is based on it. Limited support from management. Never had an observation or 1 on 1 the entire time I worked there, so pretty much got to do what I wanted! Customers can get downright nasty in your chair, so you just have to sit back and enjoy the show. WF reputation has the FA's and other execs fleeing, so be prepared to defend and deflect! Not really a good place to advance your career, I saw people without degrees become managers. Pay is Embarassing."
good,Pretty typical big bank culture. Learn a lot from your immediate manager and seasoned employees. Everyone does their job and grows together.  You're responsible for doing what's right for the customer as well as what's best for the company.  Which sometimes can cross paths.
good,"Wells fargo displaced the whole work site in Rancho Cordova, They did not care what happened to their employees, Our site was one of the most experienced and profitable sites and they canned all of us"
good,Collections was hard and unless you are good at removing your emotions I wouldn't suggest it to anyone. The goals they set were hard to reach and the calls were very intense and alot of the time negative.
good,I really enjoyed working with my colleagues. I was not challenged intellectually in my position and felt like I learned very little. It was a lot of busy work.
good,General lack of understanding from the people making decision. A lot of job were allocated overseas which is not conducive  to working banking hours over here.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Depends on who you know. In the call center there is a lot of corporate politics. The hiring process once you're inside is based off if they like you.
good,"It’s an OK place to work. Nothing special about it yet nothing bad. My hours were cut to part time for awhile, making this the reason I quit. Could have been better if it were full time."
good,"Wells Fargo & Company is an American multinational financial services company headquartered in San Francisco, California, with central offices throughout the United States."
good,"The job was interesting, and they stressed the importance of accuracy and attention to details. You job performance was measured by metrics as to how each call went, and how helpful you were to each participant in the 401k plan."
good,"Like most large enterprises you tend to be along for the ride.  Pay scale was not great and raises are meager, all things considered.  Nothing stood out as exceptional."
good,"not a bad place to work but it all depends on management, my district was rotten all the way from my manager all the way up to regional manager... "
good,Management tends to be passive aggressive in some of the Roles. some managers can be very unsupportive when it comes to moving onto another role. Training is pretty minimal which can be stressful when taking on a complex role.
good,This was a temp position through an agency.  This job did not last long and there were no permanent openings for employment at the time. This was a nice place to work with a great supervisor.
good,"If you are in certain cliques or networks your raises & advancements are almost assured, if not then you watch as management brings in less qualified and less experience person's off the street for higher pay and level than people doing the job already."
good,"Management need understand that order for a team member to grow, there should be a level of professionalism and decorum involved. Having both a Bachelors and Master's degree in business, the company can learn a lot from other successful business especially when it comes to People Management. Unfortunately management is not carrying out the vision or mission of the company itself which leads to the disruptive culture. Not all management are out of line at the company, but enough to bring a negative view of the company."
good,"Wells Fargo is a horrible company to work for! They don't pay their employees! I worked there for 5 years and only received a 10 cent, 35 cent and a 25 cent raise."
good,"Being such a huge company the upper management has no control over what each district manager does and since I worked in so many different districts and know how the company has a whole works and should be worked from the top down. In my experience, always talk to the people who currently work there."
good,"It started out a great company to work for, then it took a turn.  Don't get me wrong it's still a good company.  The pay increase they did helped and was nice, they do try to create a welcoming culture.  I did move positions and ever since then is when it went downhill.  I switched departments to enjoy some downtime on the phones, four months after I joined, they took away that department.  Then with the settlement, they took us and put us on a special team which was great, but did end up keeping some of the team on that special que, then the rest they had us take overflow calls, basically putting back to what our normal job was, no benefit for either banker or company.  I put in for time off in December before the department I was in shut down, only thing keeping me from having that time off was the department itself, when they took that away, my time off waitlist went up so high management was not willing to put it in since I should have gotten it."
good,"High pressure sales in all aspects of the bank. I worked there several years ago so things may have changed since then, but it was very high pressure which caused me to leave."
good,Management was very motivating and hands on. but felt like just a number. no matter how many goal I hit somehow I never received my bonus. Great training!
good,Management quality varies. Sales are still expected even though the mission doesn't make it seem that way. Bonuses were driven off customer service and branch sales growth.
good,"I was fortunate \enough to get my foot in the door and work my way up, but after almost 7 years of working hard, hitting goals, being promoted 3 times and then being in that position for 4 years, I have hit a wall."
good,"Too many managers"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells is a good co overall, however I was in a situation w almost no training for a job I was new to and very poor management. Moral was pretty low and there were frequent firings"
good,Excellent health care benefits. Good work environment and good coworkers. Too much micromanagement and excessive meetings take away from time spent on needed work.
good,"Not a fun place to work.  Was always stressed as to when the next layoff was coming.  Didn't like feeling like a number, no matter how hard you worked or how good your work was."
good,This company is after mortgagees who cant pay their loans. They denied people with above 720 credit scores and plenty of reserves. Clients were able to go to Quicken Loans and close the loans which were denied by WFHM. The crazy thing is that WFHM would buy the exact same loans they denied that were approved by Quicken Loans.
good,Typical 9-5 work day. All holidays off and every Sunday off. Hardest part of the job is trying to meet sales metrics on a daily and weekly basis. Bonuses given quarterly for meeting metrics.
good,"When I started with Wells Fargo the mortgage industry had just collapsed.  The environment I went into included layoffs and people quitting.  However, I went on to a better department and enjoyed it for a year.  But, I wanted more money, and after another year transferred to my last department. That department changed as the laws changed.  What started off as a salesy processor role, turned into an underwriter role that went through several internal and external audits.  The process was broken down, morale changed, managers were over worked, team members had mandatory OT; and transferring to a new department or role became lateral moves with no raises. My last manager was great, but I went through a series of dysfunctional managers before that. Overall, Wells Fargo had excellent insurance, a decent PTO structure that was transparent, several discounts and lots of outlets."
good,Small branch with 2 full time employees besides my part time position. Coworkers did not get along making for a stressful environment. Management did not help defuse the situation.
good,Love the co-workers. Best part of the job. Job is stressful but the clients and transactions are interesting. Management is overwhelmed and not sure how to combat problems.
good,Wells Fargo lacks making the employees a priority. If a family emergency comes up it doesn’t matter you are expected to work as scheduled or modify your emergency to fit their needs.
good,The work place culture has changed a lot in the past couple of years. Employees no longer feel secure. The career advancement no longer appears to be available.
good,"For the most part it was a good company to work at. My coworkers were excellent, hardworking and dedicated to customer satisfaction. We frequently used each other as a resource problem solve.  However, I didn't feel local management was interested in employee input or workflow improvement and the communication was non-existent.  We saw our manager maybe every other month."
good,"I worked for the company for many years. They have a high turnover rate, high layoff rate and are concerned with moving operations overseas to cut back on spending here in the United States. Since starting with the company, it has had mass layoffs and workplace stability is always a concern. You never know when your last day may be. The employee incentives have decreased significantly over the years. Advancement is always available but if there is a layoff, there is no option for internal replacement elsewhere in the company. The largest bank in the United States but greed has taken over the once wholesome family oriented company culture."
good,"Many contractors, not a,lot,of FTE opportunities, very slow hiring process and unresponsive Human resources recruiters. Questions not answered with much detail"
good,if you like being cussed out daily and have to read scripts all day and note everything you do through-out your day and sitting and looking at two screens and being on the phone all day then wells fargo call center is for you. if you used the bathroom you have to write it down and how long it took and that goes for everything you do in the day. the scripts you read have to be word for word with no changes or mess ups or you will be pointed for it. management is a joke.
good,"For most of my time working for Wells Fargo I have enjoyed being a team member. However, after 2016 it seems as though there is not much focus on how team members are treated by higher ups and customers. The work life balance isn't great and there isn't much room for advancement anymore. My current role has to be the most overworked and under paid."
good,"Decent place to work. Ample opportunities to learn skills. Management was spotty. Workplace culture was lackluster."
good,Company attempts to care for its employees but in the end it’s about their bottom line. If you have a great manager things will probably be a lot better. The manager can make things happen for you on the back end
good,"I was contracted to work with Wells Fargo for 6 months. The training was subpar and the culture was hectic. Fed wire investigations has a steep learning curve and if you're unable to grab it, there is little room for assistance for you to gain that understanding."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Lack of vision and strategy to turn around the current situation to regain its brand and credibility. Most jobs are getting outsourced to other countries so there is no career stability in Wells Fargo any longer
good,Not very conductive. Disorderly and not properly staffed.  No metrics to keep one motivated. Extremely understaffed while management does nothing but point the finger ...if they even show to work.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working as a HARP refinance processor.  Management was great.  The company decided they would not provide a product to replace the HARP refinance, so our department was placed on an AML remediation project, which was totally new to me.  I enjoyed learning the AML process."
good,Promotions were limited and nearly impossible to achieve. Easier to leave and come back than to be adequately compensated.  Current management is running a great company into the ground.
good,"An employee's opinions of Wells Fargo from a branch level can be determined by the attitude of the Branch and Service Managers. Wells Fargo has a lot of amazing managers which encourage development and make work a fun place to be everyday. "
good,Big team size. Typical big corporation working environment. Not much room to project own ideas. Micro managing is common. Given sufficient time to finish tasks.
good,if you lile cuatomer service the company it id a great place to be and also if you are good handling complaints and dealing with difficult customers and managment people
good,The people are an amazing group that offer support and developement.  Supporting my team members in their growth within the company has been the m ost rewarding part of my position.
good,"This is a great company when you don't want to apply any sort of critical thinking skills, as well as make any decisions for yourself. "
good,"Wells Fargo was a good job, they offered competitive benefits and pay however they didn't offer enough hours to offset the pay and benefits. However the job its self did allow for advancement opportunity."
good,"I was contracted by Aerotek to work with Wells Fargo on a temporary basis.  I loved the work I did and that I got to help agents improve their skills, however the company overall, I feel does not support their employees."
good,You are just a number. Your work history or performance or attendance does not matter! I loved my Lead Teller job at this branch! Just never felt appreciated.
good,Paid $13/hour starting which now they offer $15/hour starting good money but lacking of morals in mgmt and hr is unhelpful in fixing discrimination issues. Workplace bullying by upper mgmt was the reason I quit after 3 years of service. Reported issues to my boss about my assistant mgr and my gm ignored my concerns and then my gms boss took their side and all the mgrs ganged up on me to get me fired.
good,Given plenty of opportunities for learning different skills but mirco managed to the point where its hard to complete my job duties. More responsibilities for the same amount of pay and very little recognition.
good,"Wells Fargo is great if you're a fast learner- as you won't be trained on anything!  I was thrown head first into my position and sent to work from home after 2 days- I was essentially given phone numbers on who to contact if I needed technical help, how to contact my manager, and how to contact HR.  Other than that, everything is literally tribal knowledge- and you'll definitely need to reach out to other business partners to learn your way around the institution.  Wells generally likes to hire contractors first as this gives them a way to determine if you can ""catch on""- if you can, great, you'll be an FTE in no time- if you can't, you'll be back with your agency."
good,"When the department was managed well, it was a very fun and rewarding place to work.  During that period I earned a very high income and had lots of enjoyable moments."
good,"it was good experience, got a chance to learn new technologies and got to learn many methodologies working in wells. Got a chance to lead and work along some of the best in business."
good,"Depending on your department, you had very little or no job advancement chances.  There was good health coverage.  Everytime you would get close to making a bonus, they would change the guidelines.  This happened about every 3-4 months."
good,When  I was working there everyone was so stressed out with the sales goals. They wanted employees to basically push products on customers to make sure you met your sales goals.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo had great training and benefits. Depending on the position that I had during the years I was there, the manager could be really great or a couple of times, the management team was unreasonable. The most difficult part of the job was the goals that management set I considered unreasonable to be able to do a good quality job."
good,In this position one is an IT factory worker. Each day a queue of tickets is filled and when it is completed more is added. Rules are learned as you go along and mistakes are the teacher.
good,the training process is great and seem supportive but once you are in you are on your own and responsible for your self development managers are always moving around so constantly inconsistent policy's and procedure enforcements
good,This is a data entry job. Rules are strict. No cells phones. No to much talking and frolicing amoungst other employees. You have to meet your quotas and type at least 10000 kspm
good,productivity numbers seem to matter more than anything. Poor management and unrealistic expectation result in long hard workdays. New hires take 1-3 months to get hired so fluctuations in staffing has huge impact on workers when someone quits. Everyone there is consistently held hostage to work 10-12 hour days to ensure poor planning meets requirements for division leader in another state.
good,Great time working at wells until we got new senior management no support always negative. Management was always looking for something negative to say and no recognition.
good,Wells Fargo has a standard corporate culture with high ethical standards.  Wells Fargo intends to exhibit fairness and a good customer experience to all.  Their online products must conform to guidelines for accessibility.
good,"The company is good at marketing and protecting itself legally, and in finding innovation products to market...and providing jobs. However, they still seem unable to put themselves in the place of a typical customer. They still bury pricing material in terms and conditions and product fine print...they just don't ever seem willing to come clean on all the borderline items...like full, clear, open disclosure on all products and service features...positive and negative from a customer perspective including pricing and fees. The company still has a clear internal bias in it's own favor...they cant seem to figure out how to love their customer the way they love themselves :-) "
good,"Managed 10 underwriters looking at credit requested from $100,000 to $5,000,000 from businesses along the east coast. Enjoyed working with my team but did not enjoy the Wells Fargo metrics. Metrics first, customer last."
good,Flexible work schedule and demanding environment.  Great customer interaction and provide a wide variety of services.  Executive management is rarely involved and tough culture with all employees being remote.  Love the customers and the ability to work with them.
good,"Mature PMO, many projects with disperse groups. Integrated systems for resource, costs and documentation. Must be able to forecast resources and cost within acceptable variance."
good,lousy pay to employees. Their goals can sometimes be unrealistic and often wants you to work more than they are willing to pay.the best thing is the name of the company on your resume.
good,"The majority of upper management is disconnected with the job and the people.  Otherwise the company is okay, the benefit are pretty good, and lower management is competent."
good,"Working at Wells was okay. Appears many changes are taken place at Wells Fargo and hope the environment has changed for the better. Wells Fargo has much talent, many dedicated employees who work extremely hard and long hours. They all deserve the best from a from a major institution."
good,"Worked in one group where the Manager was top rate; the next group, the manager was text book Narcissist and sociopath and it seemed to run in groups of them. They hired people from their church and promoted them; they constantly denigrated their managers and other teams (knowing those teams, it was all a complete lie); given that the calls were recorded it is too bad the calls are not audited and the person questioned about what they say and do."
good,Great place to work but manager really made a difference for my experience. Wells Fargo was my first employer and I was able to learn a lot. I began as a teller and ended as a personal banker.
good,Strong long time company. The company is taking measures to make things right for account-holders.  My immediate manager was great and he worked hard to foster a good team culture.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"This job has cultivated my client service skills and I enjoy the people I work with. However, there are times where it seems management doesn't have your best interest in mind."
good,Focus of office is based on customer interaction.  Everything that happens is customer focused.  Volunteer paid time off.  Company is very focused on community envolvment.
good,company was great. however supervisor is HORRIBLE. has no regard for the people under her command and would do much better in a position with no people under her.
good,"Typical day at work starts with phone conference, team meeting and daily targets to achieve project deadlines. Workplace culture is great and team work is very important."
good,"nice people, average corp FI salary, lacks really strong leadership and drive for customer focus across the enterprise.  Business transformation in progress but lagging competition."
good,"Wells Fargo gave opportunities for advancements, although typical work related issues started to arise. Politics will always be part of a job, and sometimes ruins what you have created for so long, and felt like this is the time to move on. Also, after the whole fiasco with Wells in the consumer banking, it created a domino effect where the jobs are starting to shift towards oversees and too many job opportunities are leaving the US, hence job security is no longer there. Workers are afraid to lose their jobs due to Wells cutting budget."
good,"I was offered FTE after my 18months with WF.  I passed due to the micromanagement that was part of the daily grind.  The people were about 50% engaged in operations or working at half speed,"
good,Lack of values in the company led to their downfall and the employees who tried to do the right thing would pay the price.  Great benefits but the quality of life if you were in the branch was awful as a manager as you were expected to be there from 7 in the morning for conference calls until 7 or 8 at night for more conference calls everyday.  too much sales integrity and false promises to customers.
good,"I worked for Wells Fargo in 3 different States, Henderson, NV was fun and Management was great! Good Management is key to an employees success and happiness."
good,"Wells Fargo strives to achieve the ""One Wells Fargo"" goal. The opportunities to meet people are endless and the atmosphere is great in my building and on my floor. The management team does a tremendous job of helping answer work related questions, along with being personable and respectful, no matter what your job title is."
good,"Being in this company for so long, my experience has been a mix of highs and lows.  I've gained a multitude of skills that are only valued on one's present position but undermined when it comes time to appraise one's performance, which equates to little or no money.  That's all I'll say about that."
good,"I had a very good manager, but the management above him and further up the chain did not have a clue of what was going on or how to do the job. The politics of advancement was ridiculous. You either had to be friends with management or related."
good,"All day is spent at computer. Will learn a lot of regulations, policies. Will occasionally be up trained to other positions. Room for advancement and also able to move to other positions within the company"
good,Pay and benefits are lacking.  Hard to advance.  Education & increase knowledge occurs on your own time.  This is typical bank environment between BofA and Wells.
good,"I spent 3 1/2 years originating mortgages as an HMC there. After a year I was able to hire Jr. HMCs to work underneath me and work my way up to becoming a sales manager. I got good branches to work at and found branch personnel to be somewhat cooperative in providing referrals. I left because I found a better opportunity elsewhere, but I would not object to working there again in a different division than home mortgage."
good,"The culture at Wells Fargo was interesting.  I was allowed to do my job without much interference the last year I worked there.  For several years, I was micro managed and over scrutinized.  They also had a system that ensured the employees that performed the most efficiently would get an increased workload.  On a regular basis, 1 employee could get up to 5 times the workload of the person sitting next to him/her."
good,"OK place to work, nothing special. Pay raises are not very good. A lot of time off. Company culture is not the best. promotions based on who now not how well you do your job"
good,"Very fast paced high production environment. Management was lacking, large disconnect between employees and managers. Pay could be more competitive as well."
good,"Good experience working for Wells Fargo, but the advancement wasn't there for financial growth nor able to work overtime to make it worth the biweekly pay"
good,overall the 7 years I spent at wells was good. I met some friends I still stay in contact with today and learned a lot of leadership skills while int the bankruptcy department.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"It was a good place to work."
good,"It was stressful at times because it was basically sales. The hours were low to avoid having to provide benefits. My peers were nice, most of the time."
good,"I can say my job itself i loved, unfortunately depending on the department it is based on who they like and not who is qualified for the position. I had been a temporary employee for 11 months and completing tasks that a team lead would be responsible for. I trained employees, completed quality reviews and was a resource for many people, due to conflict of personality I was denied full time employment and then had my contract cancelled. I do not believe this is an issue in all departments, but definitely get to know who will be managing you, they can be your mentor or your enemy."
good,"I advanced with a lot of opportunity. Management helps out alot, and a great company to work for. There are lots of different positions with potential to grow."
good,"Only care about productivity, don't let you use you PTO, easy job for what you are doing.  Not worth the effort it takes to become a full time employee."
good,Ok company to work great benefits. room for advancment but pay is not enough for all the work you do.  I love the fact that the are very involved on volunteering
good,Site leader was an inflexible manager that kept her supervisors and team leads on phone call meetings most of every day. She was not open to outside suggestion from associates let alone her managers.
good,One has to be very flexible to work at Wells Fargo - guidelines change all the time. They are trying harder to provide better customer service.  They try to give little perks to employees.
good,"It is a very strongly regulated environment."
good,Overall great place to work but you can always make improvements. I enjoyed my job helping consumers who were about to loose their homes due to hardship.
good,Management was inconsistent and constantly changing. Unethical sales goals led to poor customer service for customers when providing banking services. Only concern was for maximizing their sales to receive bonuses.
good,They hire just about anyone it seems and w/ out much training. Hard to also bring in more business when they are constantly in the news about doing something wrong.
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with at Wells Fargo but I hated the forceful politics and negativity pushed when up for promotions! It was very irritating to receive 4/5's in all categories of review but then told no one is getting a raise although you were a top performer!!!
good,WF is going through a lot of management changes due to the fraud. They are trying to regain people's trust with that they focusing in restructuring all the teams.
good,"Management lacked focus and work ethics. The team was wonderful to work with and lead by a good individual. Favoritism and management roles with people who don't know the job on hand is one of the concerns but not easy to bring  cultural change.  Takes effort , dedication and a genuine desire to bring that change."
good,not too bad overall.  there is definitely some micro management.  It's a job that can get you by with what they pay but I feel there are better options out there.
good,"The people were great, training is great, benefits are okay, and they make you feel a part of a team. Being a collector, anywhere, is difficult. I really liked all the managers."
good,"I gave this company eight years of my life and worked myself to the bone, but when I had to go out on stress leave, I was treated with disdain. And when I returned to work on a three-day work schedule, they found a reason to get rid of me. Not conducive to family life when you have small children and life challenges."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo is a great opportunity to grow with. They are defiantly supportive in employment and the lives of community services, and offers a lot of support to the needs for the people in disasters as well."
good,"Pre meetings, prep meetings, debrief meetings, follow up meetings, and the like take the bulk of most days.  Several priorities linger because multiple points of view opine before any action is ever taken"
good,I Wouldnt work there again because the work/life balance can be non-existent t because of the stress of the environment. I watched unethical things take place and reported them but no solution was made. After I decided to leave due to upper management trying to cover up incidents instead of taking ownership and resolving these issues. They didn't even want to do an exit interview with me to resolve the issues to ensure they wouldn't happen to another team member.
good,"Working at Wells Fargo I learned that I could not impact change. The site had accommodations like a self serve cafe, TV in the break room, microwaves, refrigerators, and a freezer. The second break room had a Foosball table. The site was clean and the people I worked with were dressed casually to the extent that some were wearing shorts to work. Upon speaking to others that worked at the site I discovered that most of them were under contract employment. Training was not something that was given a lot of thought. The impression I received was that I would either know how to complete the function with little to no training or that I would no longer be working there."
good,I worked in Wells Fargo for over 7 years and it has been a very enjoyable place to work. I bolt my first home and i also build myself throught various promotion.
good,Review emails and check voicemail
good,"A typical day as a teller at Wells Fargo was to count all you money at the beginning of the day.  Make sure the vault had the right amount of money in it.  Then you would take peoples deposits/withdrawals as well as try to sell them any product, (ie. credit card, checking/savings account, etc).  Your performance was based solely on your sales."
good,I really enjoyed the work family I had when I worked at Wells Fargo but was not a fan of the pressure of selling products to keep my job. Upper class management was not professional at the time I was employed there but my branch manager as well as my service manager were great. I would give Wells Fargo workplace a 3 out of 5 rating.
good,"affiliated with a particular service center but had flexibility to help other areas as needed, direct manager was great and trusted us to work our pipelines effectively and efficiently, upper management micro-managed and ever changing"
good,The best part about working for WF were the people I worked with. We tried to help each other get sales because we knew we were only as valuable as the numbers we put up.
good,"Great Experience met some great people , not in the company but overall in the customers. Pay was really low for the amount of responsibilities .  Management more for the next customer than for the employee. The stress levels on a day by day was very hard  and they were really inconsiderate when i found out i was pregnant"
good,"You never felt safe if someone in management didn't like you. Your total job security was based on other agent reviews. If you got a poor review, they only focused on that and not the good ones. Those were set aside as not important."
good,Pay is less than average. focus is on the customer and team members are overlooked. Lots of company propaganda without any action. Lots of talk about employees being important without any change. Middle managers are excellent but have little authority when it comes to compensation.
good,Started as a part-time teller and advanced quickly to management.  Had excellent mentors throughout my employment there that showed me the ropes and helped me along the way.
good,"Overall I enjoy working at Wells Fargo. The company is great for recent collage grads that are looking to start a  career in banking. One thing I would say Needs Improvement would be the job structure, some of the day to day activities make it hard to perform at the best of your ability."
good,"Personally, I liked my time at Wells, especially after they did away with individual sales goals. The reality is, your team is going to determine how much you enjoy working there. A great manager and great team members will make you love it, despite the nagging customers that flow in. "
good,This role definitely had a lot to teachable. It was a fast paced environment where priorities changes continuously so we never truly had all of the information. I guess it didn't really help that they were in the headiness in a rather negative light.
good,"Well Fargo is not a bad place to work, but the company has been in some trouble lately. The compensation system has changed, and the incentive was terrible this year. It did not compensate for the raise in our insurance."
good,Very nice place to work. Fast pace with a number of releases and projects to work on. Enjoyed my time working on the project. I learned a number of things while working there.
good,"It was a good place to work, Solutions were definitely a must get! I did like the emphasis on community and home life. Managers acted like they cared."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Very busy due to the First Interstates merge with Wells Fargo"
good,"Wells Fargo would be one of the coolest places to work if advancement was fair. Its not what you know its who you know. It doesn't matter if you have an extensive background, managers select who they want."
good,There are many wonderful people at Wells Fargo and I enjoy going to work to associate with them.  There comes a time when being held back career wise and advancement outweighs the amiable atmosphere.
good,"Easy job being a teller, hours suck and never got weekends off. Hardly took any breaks, high in sales, but most of employees were fun to work with. Become a little family working at a branch."
good,"in short, wf is a place for those who do not have a clear direction on where they want their occupation to take them. i find myself in this category, so for a placeholder job, this is good. for a career that is fulfilling and rewarding, not as much."
good,Very frustrating - can't get issues addressed because no one cares.  Very reactive to regulators vs. proactively identifying and addressing issues first.  Bade culture
good,WF provides quality benefits and is a good environment for learning. The workplace environment also provides opportunity to build quality professional relationships.
good,"Wells Fargo was a nice job honestly, great place to work, with great benefits. I felt that it just really took a lot of my time away from life and family involvement."
good,"You could work hard and never see a promotion or raise. Many employees there worked very hard and some were better for roles than others, yet were passed."
good,"typical work  day is very slow, not ,much customer service interaction"
good,we were forced by our peers to sell unnecessary new accounts to customers even if they didn't need them.  we were required to ask every time they came into the store regardless the fact that we had already done it previously.
good,you can learn a lot but be very smart about it. Company is going through changes and they will not communicate with you until the change has been done.
good,"the company is going through changes which includes closing many locations and displacing thousands of employees.  They did offer relocation packages and retention as well, but this was not enough for the damage that was caused."
good,"Work environment is friendly to work and their PTO/benefit is good. A typical day will be similar to a lot of companies out there, lots of OT and give bonuses at the end of the year."
good,Don't expect that when you start working here that you will be able to advance and do what you want to do with your career. There is plenty of opportunity but when they open positions they already have people in line for that position. I can't tell you how many times I have been given a position but they still have to pretend and entertain other candidates just because they applied. It can be a total waste of time but it's important to make an impact so they forget about who they have in mind for the position you are applying for.
good,WF switched branch managers too often. Loved my roles as teller and banker and loved my customers.....................................................
good,I did enjoy working at Wells Fargo but felt this job I recently took was unsatisfying and poorly trained. The pay in my last position paid well but was not a good fit.
good,"Infrastructure is very weak and a support system is not solid or reliable.  "
good,Fast  paced environment with lots of work to be done.  Reorganization and shifting of responsibilities make it hard to stay focused on tasks and deadlines. Good place to work to learn new skills.
good,This company has an awesome team structure with a completing deadlines and projects that need to be completed in a fast pace environment. Being able work for Wells Fargo gave me the skills that I have been able to use in my work role later on in my mortgage career.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Good place to work, depending on the area.  Only downside is constantly not knowing when the next layoff will occur.  Fast paced but can be rewarding.  Management however does not always have the employee needs first."
good,was very strict  - lacked the family cohesiveness for a working team. Managers were not qualified based on experience and often lacked the leadership needed to motivate.
good,good people for the most part but wells fargo culture is not for me. I felt like I was in grade school the way they watched over me and made me follow a precise schedule.
good,Pay in banking during this time was very low. Salary would not have covered anything but the basic necessities. Job was very stressful. Ag economy was not good at the time and the bulk of my job was restructuring loans and working with attorneys.
good,"I don't like how they pushed everything to be out of house. It left your Supervisors defenseless. No HR, the scheduling was handled off site. So even temporary changes for emergencies wouldn't go through. That was ultimately why I had to leave. My department was great and supportive. My direct supervisor was pretty clueless because he was new and from a completely different department, but everyone else there was very nice and knowledgeable. "
good,"Meetings most of the day"
good,"But everybody was funny. We were never busy, so phone call was a must. Trying to bring customers in as a challenge but doable. Sometimes we had to be creative ,"
good,"Not much room for advancement but great job security and benefits.  "
good,"Employee morale is a struggle with recent news findings. Seems like the company name is in the news every day, and that has taken a toll on management and employee retention."
good,"great benefits as far as paid time off , stock option and 401k."
good,Decent place to work depending on your manager.  Every department is very different in terms of workplace culture.  The compensation is good for the work that is expected.
good,why do I have to answer this?
good,"Really depends on if your into banking. At first I came to learn more about financial products, services, and planning. Wells did provide all 3. Nevertheless if being confined to a cubical isn't your thing than stay away. Big company, a lot of resources. "
good,There was lots of turnover when I worked here. The management team was completely unfair and used their authority to their advantage which is why the turnover was so high.
good,They basically changed the job description after I started working there. You might like this job if you can handle being yelled at all day by grumpy customers.
good,This company has its ups and downs I have been there over a decade and the lack of opportunity is shown.  It is all about who you know and the pay is not comparable to the market
good,Some days were slow. Most of the time it was fast pace. quick and productive calls. We would have a team meeting usually every morning. We had a sale goals.
good,"fast paced  company goal oriented  with no chance for advancement goals were often to high to achieve, work load fluctuated  moving job load  hard to handle , management were uncaring and slow to act when help was needed"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Little to no direction and supervision, boss spent his time trying to convince his off-site manager that he was actually at his desk working, when he was actually staying home most days and not working. His boss thought he was ethical, but he was far from it."
good,This would have been a great place to work if the home market was doing great. In 2008 the market fell and so did its manage structure. This is a high stress place to work and management is always pushing the employees for more sales that they made up there own sales.
good,wells Fargo was a great place to get my foot in the door into the banking industry. it also gives a large range of other career path opportunity as well as training and licensing.
good,It is a decent job. I have been here almost six months as a contractor. I am not finding anything I like with Wells so I am branching out. My booses are ultra passive aggressive.
good,"It was alright working at Wells Fargo, since new management I feel it was unfair the way I was treated.  I enjoyed working for this company and I thought it would be a last long employment, my estimate was completely wrong."
good,"I loved working at Wells Fargo because of the opportunity to work with people and be a part of helping people understand their finances as well as options available to them. Great work life balance, good hours, just would be better if the pay were more. Benefits were good, time off is available, just need to increase rate of pay."
good,It is great to have structure in your life and the fact that WF gives so many paid time off hours and sick time and holidays it is a great career for someone who has a family.  The management could have better incentive to really get the people who are passionate about their job up the ladder or be a resource to help them see the best way to do so.  WF Does not harbor a management structure that tends to lead by example which is an important aspect of any leadership role.
good,The senior leaders came from sales background and that culture permeated itself throughout the organization in terms of the decisions made. There was not much emphasis on people and developing talent. Pay was pretty good though
good,"I enjoyed working there. The benefits are good. I had a lot of PTO days. I generally like the management there. I think they appreciate their workers in general, once you are in the right area."
good,"When I worked for WF, sales was their number one concern over customer service.  If customer service was their main objective I would work there again  However, sales is the main concern and I don't like deceiving customers."
good,"While an expert level of work was expected (and rightly so), the hourly rate was very low."
good,Great learning experience.  I was always assigned a new task.  The job was interesting; however the management was sub par and the pay was less than stellar.
good,Need more stable income. Management changed over too much. No assistance from upper management. Looking for stable income to enjoy life. Looking for ability to advance.
good,"I like this company well enough and also understand about the FCR but its rigid and the turn over here is ridiculous, due to a few unbending policies."
good,"By interesting place, I mean highly stressful in the call centers. There are a few golden managers others are very meh. The most off-putting role of my job is essentially having to help fraudsters when they call in impersonating the customer. It's often blatantly obvious when someone is calling in impersonating a customer. It's also quite funny but nonetheless, it's essentially another lawsuit waiting to happen."
good,The number of hours worked and the low pay rate for the number of hours worked were not nearly enough. The job was not a very safe place to work. Management were often demanding and unsympathetic.
good,"Overall I would love to be employed by Wells Fargo again."
good,fun to work but not a lot of career development. pay is not great and is very hard to advance. management is not great. the job is not hard at all. the most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits
good,Great place to get your foot in the door and learn the industry. Boss bought lunch a lot. Was positive most of the time. Best part was helping the customers for sure.
good,"Wells Fargo is a pretty decent workplace. The current position I am in is flexible which I appreciate and allows me to handle things if necessary. The pay is decent, however in this role I believe they should offer more. The advancement within Wells is very difficult."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I was hired by the Premier One department. Wells Fargo management claims that this is their future yet they hired and lost 45 plus people that were hired during my tenure.
good,Favoritisim was involved and its sad but most jobs are like this but what can we do about it we just have to deal with it and just try are best to fit the spot.
good,"A typical day in the Foreclosure department was to use company related programs to quote Reinstatement and Payoffs quotes along with auditing. Being accurate with attention to detail was important. Also made phone calls to 3rd party bankers with any discrepancies when quoting for the borrowers. "
good,"All positions are being relocated to the southwest closing 56 locations and relocated them into 2 centralized locations.  The reason for change is to regulate rules, laws  and regulations by the company, government and commissions."
good,Great banking experience given with this company and these positions. Was between a few branches as a floater and management at some is great while there are some branches that need someone different
good,"Constantly looking over your shoulder."
good,"Didn't really feel like I existed in this company, Lack of leadership and people who actually care about you as a person or even a employee. Don't think I would ever go back."
good,"Job is fine, co-workers are great, but the work is long and hard for bare bones pay and benefits. I love the people but the job is not rewarding and the upper upper management is out of touch."
good,Entry level department- treats employees like we are in high school and morale is low. Very hard to move up since everyone in the department is applying for the same open positions. Low pay
good,Unknown expectations going in. Great supervisor and coworkers. Told several different months of when our incentives would start. Hours not flexible. Strict work schedule at desk. Policies change all the time.
good,You need to care more of people's religious beliefs also during trading introduce the SVT faster then just a week my team that I was training with we all needed more time
good,"Wells fargo is good place to work with life balance and fantastic environment."
good,Wells Fargo is facing well known challenges but is committed to addressing them.  Workplace culture is positive and compensation is fair.  External change is both disruptive and positive.
good,"As a teller, you will be expected to stay alert at all time, which is reasonable. If you're used to a fast paced environment, then being a teller might not be an option for you."
good,"Attended career development training but not much infrastructure in my team to implement it."
good,"Overly complicated internal processes, constantly changing processes, too many people involved in multiple projects...project resources stretched thin many times."
good,The firm's or perhaps the region's standard of excellence and client service is well below mine and what I am used to making working here quite aggravating.
good,"When I was working there, I had a great team.  I worked with amazing people however their policies I did not enjoy.  I was part time but they expected me to do full time work with my referrals.  It was cut throat that people would steal the referrals and every month I thought I was going to lose my job for not making the bare minimum.  I'm pretty sure things have changed now but the location I worked for had great people in it, they just had to survive like everyone else and willing to do whatever it took to get it.  This experience helped me with the position I work for now and will never look back."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"It was an ok place to work. I worked full time and a set morning schedule which are the pros. However, it was also extremely stressful, Out of my class of 23, only 15 advanced. We were then placed in a 2nd training course, where only 11 advanced. Currently, nobody from my team still works there."
good,"Management at Wells Fargo is good about leaving employees alone to do their jobs, but they also do not like employees pointing out issues.  Likewise, reporting colleagues for violating company policy will quickly result in being shown the door."
good,"Company doesn't provide advancement to help build a award winning career."
good,"Wells fargo is a good company to have a stable job at, but they truly do make it seem like it is easier to advance internally than it really is and the management can definitely vary"
good,"Decent place to work and pretty good wages. However there are a lot of low level managers that like to assert their power for no reason. Also the company needs to support and encourage, work from home, a standard."
good,"As an employee there was a lot of turnover as far as qualified management and employees. I worked at one location who had as many as 6 people hired/left in a matter of one year. "
good,"I was a teller at the Granite Bay location inside Raleys. That location no longer exists."
good,"The company is evolving and with that there are painful changes. there are areas in the bank that are well managed and productive. Others are not. I have been there 24 years and have a wonderful story of opportunity and relationships. "
good,This job was not verify difficult but I enjoyed my co workers and the overall environment. I also enjoyed the dealership relationships that we have and liked my overall job.
good,"Plan on micro-management, not much integrity, on the phones all day back to back calls. "
good,"Overall, this organization is okay. They offered a decent wage and benefits. The management was okay.The work culture was good. The majority of the staff were decent people."
good,The work environment is tense given the level of details required on the job.You may not get a second chance to make a positive first impression but with persistence this dream can be achieved.
good,Worked for a superb manager who provided challenging work that fit my skill sets.  She also provided great coaching and positive feedback. The workplace culture was collaborative and productive.
good,"Management needs more people skills.  I think they set unrealistic goals for employees but do not follow a set goal of their own.  "
good,"Wells Fargo was a good company in general, but I feel that there was a lack of advancement where I was.  And upper management seems to lack leadership skills."
good,The company overall at this point has room for growth and improvement. There is a need to show more employee appreciate in some certain dept. since bonuses are not an option for them.
good,"A typical day is constantly on the go and being able to multi-task because there are quite a few things that get thrown at you. As management you need to make sure that you are able to coach your team, keep in state and federal compliance and maintain a consistently high level of customer service."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"fun place to work "
good,"Management can be conflicting and often unprofessional, overall if higher levels of management were involved they would do their best to treat others with respect."
good,I did not agree with polices or Management style. I enjoyed my team of co-workers. The hardest part was mandatory overtime without notice. I learned that the financial industry is not for me.
good,"The employees were a joy to work with. Developed wonderful relationships with many there.  The benefits were great, however the work/life balance was way off. Upper management did not have any consideration for employees."
good,Overall it is good. Management should be much more better and salaries should also be hiked. Work culture and work life balance is awesome in wellsfargo.
good,Good place to work overall. leadership structure has room for improvement. Culture of caring is promoted but lacks follow through by upper management.
good,My former manager was a great friend and coach.  He was always available whenever an issue arose in my department.  The culture was friendly and there was a lot of activities to keep employees engaged at work.
good,Weekend installs were required once a month and flexibility was not given to work hours before and after the install.  Management was very strict on hours worked.
good,The job was great and most of the staff I worked with but management was terrible and was ultimately why I decided to look for a new job. I was having problems with them that affected my work because I felt I was singled out on many things and treated like I didn't know what I was doing when I continued to do my job correctly but I will admit I made a few mistakes that corrective action was taken but not when others did the same things. I was basically made an example of and humiliated each time I made a small mistake and then talked to as if I was an idiot.
good,Working at Wells Fargo was a great job while I was in school. I worked in a college town so my managers were used to working around student schedules. I did not like the pressure that was placed on employees to make sells. That is why I left.
good,"management needs work"
good,"Organized place to work, however most of workers were contractors.   hard stop for contractors after 18 months.  Management was decent. A lot of teams, so typically for senior titles you wont have to wear as many hats."
good,the management is not clear at what is going to be the next move one min your working a good shift the next min your basically thrown to the wolfs.  theres favorites and if you haven't made the cut your out of luck !
good,work day varies but can be very fast paced some days. culture is well founded but company and managers tend to overly micromanage. customers are the best part of job
good,"When you have a good manager things can be completely different. However, it seems like at Wells anyone can be a manager. No degree needed just a little experience"
good,I was able to learn a lot of things at wells fargo but after a few years it was time to move on.  There is a constant churn of new emlpoyees and thus a confusion always reigns.
good,"Lots of work to be done when busy, however they tend to hire too many at one which leads to lots of layoffs once business slows down. Most offices have a great work environment with great managers, but with wells fargo as a whole, yo.u will just be a number"
good,"the most enjoyable part  of my is learning about customers and building relationships. "
good,"Great Environment, with a lot of diversity, I learned to problem solve when it came to banking concerns, there was a lot of opportunity for advancement after working there for a year."
good,"Do not wish to complete . It is provided on my resume..."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Had too many goals to meet before any money was awarded. Management had their favorite employees, such as the rich ones or well known in the community."
good,I would take calls to help customers with their banking needs. The staff was a lot of fun and I truly made some life long friends. The job itself was very repetitive and not challenging enough.
good,"The office I worked for has been closed down for several years, so I can only comment on the overall corporate policies that effected me while I was employed by them. Lots of regulations and paperwork for the large corporation. High expectations, little recognition.Many chances for other positions within the company Good benefits."
good,"Lots of training and vacation time, various perks such as paid time off, lunch provided frequently and  flexible shifts. Sometimes the company is understaffed."
good,"The company is average in every way. There has been much controversy with Wells as of late. It's a culture of sale first, customer second. Hence the issues they have had with setting up unauthorized accounts and the fines which have come from that."
good,Had to have energy by keeping up on products and policies. Always listening for the clues from the customers and managers on what to do to make your goals.  Focus on getting business which made it hard from time to time.  At time managers were okay but other times it was disenchanted.
good,Workplace culture has improved since the company was in the news for creating fake accounts. Hard to move forward unless someone takes you under their wing.
good,"Highly stressfull place to work an almost impossible to advance your career. I was promised promotion and so ""trained"" at the position to then be told that the position was to be offere out of state. then I trained the new person"
good,"Extremely demanding environment.  You were pushed to the limit to make your quota, that was the only way you were able to get a bonus. It was a 24 hour a day operation.  The customer is always first.  The majority of the staff were always looking for better opportunities.  Advancements were few.  The best part of the day was leaving."
good,Management is very unorganized and there is very little training to equip you for the job that you are working. There is no professionalism between management and team.
good,This position was just alright. It eventually got me the experience I needed for career advancement. The hours for the department made it difficult on the family.
good,"The benefits are some of the best I have ever had or seen.  The pay is about average.  The culture of big banks is to only get bigger, and to do this you have to meet sales quotas."
good,"Cultural diversity is something they say but not as they do.  Barriers exist and customer centric is a marketing and advertisement.  Women and minorities make up 49%, the rest are white American male and are relatively balanced.  Corporate office in NC has issues with retention."
good,I would come to work just to be around the people I worked with. it gave me an upbeat spirit. I was greeted with a smile by my supervisor and when I needed time to myself I was allowed that time without hesitation
good,There is not enough time in the day to complete tasks. Not enough staff for adequate training. It causes stress that affects my daily life.  I do not find personal interest in this job and I do not feel fulfilled.
good,"Work-life balance can be challenging if you are not careful.  Benefits are affordable.   Most enjoyable part is entering the buildings and saying hello to friendly faces.  Most challenging is the amount of time spent on Instant Messages and conference calls, leaving less time to complete tasks."
good,"Monthly goals and metrics were required to be met, however management and coaching teams were not always effective in providing aid.  It was made to seem like there was always help available, which for the most part was true, but it was not always positive or beneficial."
good,Definitely was a job not a career. Although I respect Wells Fargo and their company the majority of the time felt like a number. This is before they made massive changes to their company structure.
good,"There are a ton of benefits and options available to assist you with every area of your life.  They are very supportive in your work like balance.  I facilitated the curriculum to new hires and prepared them to be successful in their new role.  I learned a lot about developing myself as well as developing others.  The hardest part of my job was adjusting to such a relaxed cultural where certain behaviors are not typically tolerate in the workplace.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the people.  Also, delivering information is such a way people actually learn and can apply the information.  I love seeing the revelation of new information in people."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Every part of the job is judged on how fast the work is done and how many units are produced. The people that work there are great and are really the only reason that I continued to work there.
good,"the short time i was there was a great place to work it was through temp agency, management was good in training but the only thing i did not like they told me it was a customer service job and ended up working as a sales agent for the products they have"
good,"Due to the merger of Wells Fargo Bank and Wachovia Securities (now known as Wells Fargo Advisors), the  Wachovia Securities brokerage systems were integrated with some of Wells Fargo Bank’s systems."
good,Good job for people who don't have a formal education. Get decent pay without learning hard skills. Can advance without schooling. Just be able to get on the good side of management and their managers.
good,"I think WF has a lot of opportunities for a variety of areas.  Each area has their own culture, management style and development steps.  My personal experience started great, but changed once our group became part of another sub channel.  The growth opportunities, recognition, and development strategy changed and a negative way.  In addition the resources and tools used to help facilitate day to day functions changed as well.  Management and other associates started to leave and take on other positions outside of WF. Which brings me here to continue my search."
good,Upper management is ruthless! They all lie to your face and threaten your job when you have a bad day/week in sales. They mandate that you make your sales by whatever means necessary.
good,"Great learning and advancement opportunities, training in various"
good,Senior management not held accountable for actions. hard to advance to certain dept and areas. raises are small or nonexistent. The benefits are worth staying for. A lot of favoritism and people advancing based on who likes them and not skill or previous work. Some of the senior management lack business acumen and common sense and make decisions on a whim. Not a very stable place to work at currently due to large number of lawsuits and fines. Typical corporate America.
good,"There are major pros and major cons here, that makes it hard to make a strong conclusion.  Pros are great, you have freedom to work from multiple locations, offices given, remote laptop access given..they allow you to go on multiple events or trainings throughout the year.  They have a great organized pipeline management system with ability to have clients apply and upload what's needed electronically.  Sounds like they treat you like an adult right?  Not exactly. As with any bank servicer, it's more than a challenge to reach high and consistent level of income. The payout does not match how much work you will put into each loan file, biggest gripe you will find from any veteran Lender.  Even when you're rolling, you will have a 'drawback' you have to constantly cover to negate your earnings.  This makes it hard to put the customer first when you have to consistently have 8-10 files you are working diligently on at the same time, which is what you'll need to make a good living."
good,"Having been a part of two other banks which ultimately merged with Wells Fargo, I can say that the upselling requirements on tellers was unrealistic and ultimately caused serious tension in the branch. I would not like to work there again."
good,I enjoy working at Wells Fargo. My co-worker are great.  I don't like the way management is.  They seem to have favorites and they make it clear who they are.   They play games and change their minds on a daily occasions.
good,the main goal everyday is to hit your goals given to you by management. once you finish training you don't get anymore until you get another position. the coworkers are always team players. the hardest part is when you have a slow day if you don't see a lot of people then you cant hit your goals.
good,Company is good but the communication isn't good. Support isn't best based on the structure of the environment. Difficult to communicate with overseas contractors.
good,"My department is currently overstaffed, and for some reason just added 14 more underwriters to our portfolio.  We have very little work to do and can only get one file per day before we run out of work.  In order to be eligible for bonus, we are required to decision 7.50 deals per week.  When we can only work one file per day it is literally impossible to get a monthly bonus."
good,"Recently Wells Fargo has had some negative media publicity; but in my opinion overall its a very god company to work for. They are very pro-employee; almost to a fault, and there are plenty of opportunities for advancement in most departments. Wells Fargo is better know for job stability than for what is paid to the employees, but the benefits are great."
good,9 to 5 workplace schedule always getting off by 5 or 6 some saturdays as well. Can be a hard job as if you are not very knowledgeable about banking are other apsects.
good,"Daily calls to set appointments with business & personal account holders for financial review."
good,Fast retail banking.Cash handling skills required. No more sales pressure. Upper management always want more than what you provide. It may never be enough.
good,I enjoy working with my co workers. I like the distance from home to work and insurance is good. I also enjoy my schedule. I just wish some job some job opportunities in North Carolina where in Georgia
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I enjoyed the experience at Wells Fargo, however, I felt the communication to the customers were very restricted. We were restricted to what we could mention to the customers that would benefit them; suggestions were suppose to be in benefit of the company regardless of the persons preference. "
good,"Increasing micromanagement practices being employed.Not enough accountability and intense focus on extremely short term solutions, which always come back to haunt."
good,"The hours are good.  Pay is fair.  Work/life balance is very good.  I work remotely."
good,I worked several projects per month and always met my dateline. I had the opportunity to work with several different managers in several different departments.
good,"Proactively sold products, checking, savings, consumer time accounts, credit cards, home equity/personal loans and lines of credit. Provided maintenance servicing for existing clients and referred customers to other areas of the bank as appropriate. Resolved difficult customer situations effectively while delivering friendly customer service and ensuring the highest level of customer satisfaction. Duties included complete review, decision, and condition clearing for Home Equity and personal accounts. Completed a final review of credit, appraisal, and income. Met crucial deadlines as requested. Assisted in the development and training of other staff members in processing. Performed many additional duties/activities assigned by management."
good,I think they can do a better job being upfront and honest with their employees. Also I think the company struggles to offer job advancement within the employee ranks.
good,"made a decent wage and was my introduction to the banking and phone industry helping customers with their accounts and also selling products to customers that could use them , such as Credit Cards , Personal Loans , and Home Equity Loans"
good,All banks are the same. They all want you to sale regardless of the fact that they keep telling us the employee we have no sales goals. Which is not true because if you don't sale then the bank makes no money. If the bank makes no money then you have no job.
good,It is a decent job for people who do not want to move up or work a standard schedule. I would not recommend the job for most people. The benefits are nice though.
good,nothing special.  found the culture to be cold and uninviting.  managers were in San Francisco.  the people that trained me were helpful.  would work there again for the right team.
good,Challenging work but fun place to work . The vacation package was very good along with the health benefits.  As far as advancement to move up or move to different department was a challenge.
good,"They no longer exist, so there's not much to say.  During the 2008 bank issue, they were bought out by Wells Fargo.  I was gone by then, so I don't have anything to say."
good,Had access to training yet never had the time to complete because of so much work.  Employees were constantly looking for better positions due to unhappiness in their role
good,"This was a temporary employment opportunity after escaping hurricane Katrina with my family.  Wachovia gave me a working opportunity when it was difficult networking to find suitable work opportunities.  The people were friendly, supportive, knowledgable, and professional.  I met alot of new people who were willing to share their expertise with a newcomer."
good,"workplace is different depending on location, uptown is more professional they seem to treat employees better, the wells located on Harris Blvd employees are not treated as good and work place is okay"
good,"I love the job, but I feel there is not much room for growth or opportunity. I have a business degree, and there are people there who start in positions above me with no degree, and only a high school diploma. I want to be at a job where I can grow, advance, and learn more often. I haven't learned anything new since I started there, which is very discouraging."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The pay and bonuses were good. It was easy to advance if you worked hard and got good customer service feedback. A typical day started with a conference call with your DM then a morning huddle with entire team. My duties were scheduling, cash management,  approving complex teller and banker transactions, ensured all team members met every customers' sales and service needs exceptionally and followed bank regulatory compliance at all times. I learned so much about managing money and how to protect myself personally from fraud. I enjoyed the close relationship I had with other team members. There was no work/life balance."
good,Typical day was looking at every potential customer and trying to direct them to the bankers for a product. This created a stressful environment since the middle management felt pressure to perform which they then placed on the entry level employees.
good,"If you are willing to put in the time and hard work you can grow within the company, the only thing I would say is the culture has changed a lot over the years"
good,"The immediate managers and co-workers have a good team mentality and work well together.  Unfortunately, as you go up into the higher management roles there is a major disconnect.  The regular support staff are highly overlooked."
good,benefits are great as well as other incentives for employees and their families. Management plays favorites against other employees making it hard to produce and stay on track
good,"It is very important to network with other business professionals, Its best if you have a personal book of business and clients. Always present your self in a professional manner."
good,"Coworkers were amazing and direct reports were amazing. Immediate manager was awful. Blamed me for all of her shortcoming even though I did my job and hers without support from her because she was to busy calling HR to try to fire our staff even though we were already short staffed because of her. It seems that is the culture in the Houston market. I transferred from out of state and though it was stressful as well, at least you felt valued at work."
good,"Be prepared to be coerced into committing unethical and illegal activities at the insistence of your managers. and if you stick to your convictions as I did and refuse, they will make your work life so miserable you will quit. When you promote they will promise you the salary you want and then when you are hired on they lower it without even informing you"
good,"You can have really good days or really bad days here. Staffing is generally awful, but if you like your team it's not so bad. You are not getting paid enough for how much work you are doing compared to other banks. However, if finances are what you like to work with, then this can be a good company to be in."
good,"Good place to start career, but management is hit or miss. People are encouraging but mid level managers mirco manage. Upper management can be reactive instead of proactive causing unnecessary office politics."
good,"I love Wells Fargo as a company. However, the aggressive sales environment is too much for anyone. Stressful to say the least"
good,Not very much security as far as contract work is concerned.  You can be let go at their discretion if their monthly budgets are impacted negatively. The hourly wages are substandard and need to be adjusted for the Charlotte area.
good,"Management is not the greatest, unless your manager likes you. They will let you sink. They also do not provide good training methods for tellers once your on the floor."
good,"Better Leadership, Inside the branch level the branch manager has know authority they have to get everything approved from the district manager which some times could be a problem for the customers.  Other then that good place to work."
good,"Some of the trainers are  nice/ nasty but informative and helpful. But, there is a lot of gossip, pettiness and stealing of time so be careful. The company and the pay is nice, and you can enjoy working with the nice customers. But its the bad attitude employees and managers that makes it horrible. And watch your time!!"
good,Overall the company itself is a good company. They offer a two week teller training program & it's by far one of the best one's I've attended over my banking career.
good,"At first I really enjoyed working at Wells Fargo.  It was challenging and gave me opportunities to grow.  It was not your day to day routine job - which I like.  However, I did get burned out.  The job was suppose to be temporary and lasted 5 years.  I traveled 2-3 weeks a month and was hard on the family life.  Management constantly changes which results in lost of communication and team work.  With everyone getting burned out frustration rises within the team and this makes the atmosphere unpleasant to work in."
good,This company seems like a great company to work for until you do something they dont like and become their  target and they find a way to fire you!!!!
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"In depth of capabilities and breadth of opportunities, an absolutely world class institution. My career has seen the highs and (through the recent period) the lows where retail management lost site of managing people versus numbers. The tide is turning back to the heights previously warranted and Wells Fargo continues to be a great place to begin and advance into a career."
good,"It is a fast paced environment that it is expected to work more than 40 hours a week to keep up with the demands.  The training provided is great for all levels of positions,  The systems and process is streamlined and user friendly so you can focus on the people. (Customers and team members)  If you are good, there are many avenues to move up.  If not, the pressure is great to meet their high expectation."
good,"I didn't really get to experience a whole lot before finding out the branch was going to be closing down nationwide. The time I was there, I felt under a lot of pressure learning all the new tasks that I have never experienced before. This job had many duties that I had never done and I felt rushed because it was such a busy environment and had no time for error. There was a change in branch managers during my employment which I felt made things a bit more intense. It was very hard for me to find out that the branch was shutting down because I was a single mom and needed the stability of a job."
good,Good company but the compensation is lacking. Reputable company with good top trainers and management. I feel as though Wells does not properly compensate its employees.
good,"Good company.  All the cuato,erst knows your name and the coworkers world well as a teamember and Individually. The managers are always there to help you and the coaching ando developevent is awesome"
good,This was a better contract with Apex Systems. The hourly rate was good and the job was good.  The hours were long though. Good role and great fit for me.
good,I got laid off due to budget cuts due to Wells Fargo having to pay fines and fees due to them opening fraudulent accounts. This was in a completely different area from where I worked but internally had to cut back in workforce.
good,"I loved working for this company, I disliked the management. I felt that the company wasn't concerned for any of their employee's needs as they should of been. Co workers were great aside of weak management."
good,"The job required to obtain a memo and W9 tax form for making payments on mortgages, condos, townhouses, etc.  I used Microsoft Excel and an internal system to create a worksheet showing payments.  We, as processors, were basically the back-end of the whole line of the mortgage process.  I worked there for fourteen months as a temp to hire, then they closed the whole building down and laid off about two-thousand people."
good,"I enjoyed working with the team at Wells Fargo,but i felt like my security was at stake.  Ihad toleave the company to protect myself and my family.  Overall it was okay."
good,They have terrible ethical practices. They say one thing and do another. Not for the better of the situation but to gain profits for their business. no caring behind the scenes
good,Wells Fargo can be a fun place to work at it all depends on who is in management. Having a work/life balance is hard considering the branches always seem to be short staffed.
good,"This is not a company where ideas thrive or are rewarded, you will have to fight, claw, and scratch for any semblance of opportunity, the leadership group is old and stuck in their ways and in many ways clueless and out of touch with the times, that said, they do treat their employees fairly well, and the benefits and time off are more than adequate."
good,Dealing with customers.  To give great customer service.  Management is different at different locations.  Co-workers are great.  No Hard Parts.  Customers.
good,"spent eight hours at work and shared banking experiences with teammates,learnt a lot from employees and company`s policy and procedures,working for individual and company success developed.giving excellent banking services to the client is the most enjoyable."
good,do as much as possible as quickly as you can and be sure it gets done before you go home - in the least words possible by management
good,"Wells Fargo as a company maintains a stance on diversity that is progressive for a bank. I enjoyed working there in a diverse environment, and enjoyed participating in company employee groups."
good,"I enjoyed helping customers being successful on their financial needs.  I loved to coach, develop and promote employees. "
good,The organization really believes in work life balance. 9 days on and 1 day off. The ability to work from home was a great asset that company offered and there were little long hours.
good,Ok place to work salaries not competitive Direct manager was fantastic long hours with little rewards more training  excellent benefits stressful environment
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"A typical day at Epic Int would be answering multiple emails. Balancing quick books, making payments to vendors, reviewing and requesting payment from the government, administration duties, order office supplies, correctly filing invoices in share point, checking mail, delivering packages to correct employee, sending out packages, answering phone calls, arranging travel plans for employees and arranging important business meetings."
good,"typical day is pretty steady, when it comes to the first, third and the fifteenth of the month we get a pretty heavy work load. I definitely learned a lot while working with this company, had a big part in my customer service development. management can be lazy depending on location. Co workers were ok."
good,"It is a job that ask alot of you at times it does not give back, at times you dont fell valued."
good,The compensation and benefits are above average.  Your quality of life in the branch is determined directly by the quality of manager you report to.
good,"wells fargo is an awesome company to work for in general,but at my branch management needs to step their came up asap. they like to micro manage too much and to tend to show favoritism towards other employees. again i do say its a great company to work for as far as benefits,stability, and job advancement."
good,"I excelled at this position and reached or exeeded goals. However the compensation was not strong, and this is the reason why i joined chase."
good,"Working as a teller for Wells Fargo definitely goes down as the worst job I've ever had. The managers always seemed to be hassling tellers for petty reasons beyond my understanding. The senior tellers would pair up with bankers and steal sales. When you're thunk you're meeting your goal, a piece of paper has already been passed across the counter with your customer's name on it. The sales goals were way too high. When I walked through the doors, I always felt as if I were fighting for my job and to keep my sanity. I could tell so many stories one would only sit in disbelief. It all depends on who you work with, and this crew right here, well let's just say that they could make a preacher curse."
good,"Definitely dont like the company, but loved being a teller. I had the best team where I was. We always had a great time working together which made it worth going to work everyday."
good,"It is great to work for a company knowing what is expected of you each day. Wells Fargo also ensures that each team member has ample time to spend with their families with a fairly good schedule to balance both your work and family life. "
good,"work/life balance is uneven, demanding job that requires a lot of input from management. Salary can be attractive but bonus structure is not"
good,"A typical day at work for me starts by me getting there 15-20 minutes early.  I like to start my system up, read the newspaper and enjoy a good cup of coffee."
good,"A typical call center; QA and metrics have to met. My coworkers were fun and helpful. I wasn't a fan of how the department was managed. There's a lot of micro managing that happens throughout the day. If your numbers drop at any time of the day, you were being coached by a team lead, supervisor, etc. The sales structure wasn't what I expected."
good,Wells Fargo is the forth largest bank in America protecting customer information and running the business are their primary concerns.  This affects change in the overall environment.  Change is very slow and sometimes outdated by the time it makes it to production
good,I am looking for  a new job so that speaks volume ..employees don't leave companies they leave managers.  This company management doesn't listen to the team and no work life balance.
good,very calm atmosphere have to work with difficult customers and the pay is low. you do learn to cross sale which is important. the managers are flexible with the schedule.
good,Call Structure could be a lot better. Work flow not reasonable. That's all I have to say. I have nothing else to say about this review
good,Wells Fargo will push you to meet extremely challenging sales goals until you can no longer take the pressure and you are replaced with someone new who unknowingly thinks they are up for the challenge.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"wells Fargo is a great company to work for"
good,"On a typical work day requires for me to meet deadlines, respond to emails. Stay focus on whatever project I'm working on. Everyday can be a new learning experience. I enjoy team work and helping others and always willing to learn new job functions."
good,"I worked at Wachovia - Wells Fargo for about 4 years. Everything was great when it was with Wachovia. They truly cared about their employees and took care of them. However when they were bought out by Wells Fargo that's when things went south."
good,"At Wells if you work hard and make the right connections you can get moved into a good place.  However, the obstacles for advancement are great."
good,"The work environment is pretty good, however, management leaves a lot to be desired. For contractors there is no job security, you get an extension through a set date then are terminated by management with no reason. It would be one thing if management would tell you to your face since it is in the same building, instead they have your contract agency call you right before you go home and tell you."
good,"Working for Wells is good. Do what is required, and it usually pays off. I was promoted rather quickly when I first moved to Polk county due to my sales performance, which was greatly appreciated."
good,Great Pay and Benefits. Awesome Training sessions. company gave its people a chance to excel.  Career not stable and many lay-offs in 1 year.
good,"Wells Fargo doesn't value their customers. They only want your business if you are willing to open several products.  Checking no savings,  they drill you for the savings account or credit card.  A product must be pushed in your face every time you go to the bank.  "
good,The job requires a lot of product pushing and making sure customers are always right. It is contradicting and can be very overwhelming. The management has its pros and cons.
good,Wells Fargo knows how to pick its employees. I loved my coworkers they made it worth coming to work. management was horrible and it was easy to get stagnant with no growth opportunity.
good,"the numbers you have to meet everyday are ridiculous. as a phone banker you have to meet an average of the call, warm transfer to sales and referral rates. they demand you pitch something to each and every customer. too stressful, not worth it"
good,"Very hectic job, have to be willing to put a lot of work and time into this job and you will receive a good outcome. Management isn't the best, not encouraging. However they do give a lot of paid time off and work very well with schedule."
good,"Micro managed"
good,"A good company to start with to get into the banking industry. I could make the advancement process easier and fair all around. I love to help people in the most intimate areas of their life....personal finances. I am also the business specialist who handles all aspects of small business lending, accounts, etc where I partner with my clients on behalf of Wells Fargo to help their businesses grow."
good,"If your branch is located in a shopping center or mall prepare to be in non-stop motion. The experience can be quite physical surprisingly."
good,"The job is good. Wells Fargo allows flexibility with work/life as well as good personable managers and teams. Though working for such a big organization does bring in restrictions to how the work is done. It tends to lead to more of a cog role than a fulfilling experience. The office is also very sterile and no-nonsense. Overall it is a good company and has wonderful employee's. But it is a financial institute for a reason, definitely not a start-up or new-age tech company."
good,"Inbound calls"
good,"Learn about the government regulations in reegards to BSA, Bank Secrecy Act.  Tested the software that support the bank secrecy act."
good,"Fast paced environment where you learn to work with daily deadlines and multi tasking on numerous accounts. Learned everything I know about Insurance with them. Great coworkers,management currently not as good as before. It can be difficult to see steady growth within this office."
good,"The company overall is great, they have great benefits and reasonable salaries. The company provide good technology tools and resources to learn on your own. company sponsored training is null. Flexible hours, flexibility to work from home now and then."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,If looking to develop a career in banking (Big Bank) then Wells Fargo is the place to start.  There are many great Team Members to work around.  But ultimately due to increasing industry restraints the lower level employees are feeling the crunch and as a result the joy of the environment is quickly fading.
good,"Management is an essential key to your workplace experience. Some people can't deal with the stress of sales goals. The job is really cushy, except for the sales portion. If you aren't comfortable with that, then this isn't for you. Advancement depends entirely on your sales numbers. If you are employed at branch with low foot traffic, then you are not gonna get a promotion. Tellers at busier branches get promotions, while not properly knowing how to perform as a banker. As a result, there are TONS of turnover for platform positions. Strong positive leadership eases the stress of performance goals. So, again, it depends on your management. Good management will encourage growth and career development. Bad management will just want quotas filled. Customer service is a dying breed at Wells Fargo. Being pleasant and greeting customers, with a pleasant tone, will always be there. But when it comes to solving someone's problem or opening a new account; the new account will trump everything. Everything considered, the job is not hard. It has its faults, as does all employment; but you take the good with the bad. You work normal banking hours, with most holidays off. That aspect is much better than most part-time employment. Perfect part-time job for a college student. The health insurance is expensive, but the vision insurance is great(I haven't enrolled in dental). If you let it stress you; it will crush you. I seen employees break down and cry, because of a mistake that will cost the store an account; or not meeting sales quotas."
good,the first thing i do is detail count my drawer log on my computer and as soon as we open up the doors start helping costumers with great costumer service and process their transactions and advise my costumers how to be financially successful. at the end of the day we would lock op the building and put away all cash and costumer information. exit the building and go home.
good,"wells fargo could be a great company to work for but their training needs some serious improvement because it's like you get thrown right into what you're supposed to be doing and you get information thrown at you daily and it's so much that you can't retain any of it because it goes by so fast. Also you have so many people telling you twenty different ways to do one thing and only one way is the correct way, so you don't know which way to use when it comes down to it and the goals they set for their new hires are outrageous."
good,"Work life balance and processes are poor.Management not that good,very political.Only good thing is the pressure of deadlines like in service based organisations and hike twice per year."
good,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers, providing execellent customer service, met a lot of nice people. I could not manage the stress with the sales and the managers always talking to us about numbers. We are tellers not salesmen. After 2 years I never got promoted due to my numbers."
good,"Flexible management, need to work independently and in a team environment occasionally to meet deadlines.  A job that requires accuracy and limited errors with the dealings of accounts."
good,"Very goal oriented, numbers are extremely important for career advancement, be prepared for weekly meetings about sales. Most sales are tied into the idea of being what the customers wants, but then managers push for more sales."
good,"It's a great company to work for on the corporate side, however in the branches, it's a lot of pressure to hit sales, often having to bother friends and family, and cold calling. The store manager's attitude will very by branch and usually play the biggest role on whether to enjoy the job or not."
good,"You'll learn to sell, they're a very intense sales environment and you'll need to push yourself.  As long as you're willing to learn there's room for advancement."
good,Helped many clients succeed financially and built many lasting relationships. Also learned how to manage my finances better as well as share that information with everyone i encountered.
good,Was very customer friendly. Upbeat place to work for. The only downfall is having to make sales. Alamogordo is a small town and to meet the sales expectations of a large corporation is extremely hard.
good,"sales driven and number driven environment, fast paced management worked hard to make things fun. Must be flexible and willing to accept change to work in a call center."
good,Enjoyed the doc prep area. Bank itself pushed to many bank products onto customers that were unnecessary. Has programs to inspire workers
good,"This can be a very stressful environment at times, very sales oriented, but a great place to grow a career and develop your skills."
good,"Ok place to work, as long as you have the right training and do what is right for the customer.  If you allow their sales tactics interfere with your integrity, this could have a negative impact."
good,"Working as a Certified Collector 1 at Wells Fargo has been somewhat of a challenge. Originally, I was advised that the hourly pay wasn't the best but that it was easy to qualify for the monthly incentive that is available to the employees. After excepting this job, I found out that it isn't easy to qualify for incentive and that there are many things that can cause you not to qualify for it. Secondly, when you do qualify for the incentive it does take two months for you to receive it. If you do not make your numbers, which goals change every month, you are at risk of losing your job. This department has a very high turn over rate because of this. Other than what I have mentioned the job does keep you busy, you have a set schedule, and you do get to help not only the customers get back on track financially but you get to volunteer to help the community and participate in fun activities with your coworkers."
good,"Good company; however, the company needs to pay decent wages to retain talent.I have worked in many departments. Most have excellent training except for mortgage."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Overall, mixed review.  Co-workers were great.   Met a lot of really great people. I enjoyed working with customers and found it to be rewarding.  I really enjoyed working for my 1st supervisor, who always treated me like gold, and would always go to bat for me. My performance was exceptional under this supervisor, and even received a promotion. I can't say the same, though,  for my 2nd supervisor, who was the complete total opposite.   We would get written up for not meeting a certain metric, and constantly threatened with a formal warning, subject to termination.   This supervisor was very unsupportive when it came to going to bat for their people.  As a  result, I watched my performance drop dramatically, along with everyone else's  in the group.  In addition, systems were so bad, they affected the proper servicing of our customers by breaking down daily."
good,This assignment gave the opportunity to learn about the Mortgage and Banking business.  I learned about how Home Preservation works.  I also got to use my SQL coding skills.  This allowed me to become more proficient.  Wells Fargo gave me a change to learn SSRS and to use my Business Skills such as gathering business requirements.
good,"Had the ability to increase my knowledge within so many areas, management, customer service, sales, risk, and process improvements."
good,"Great pay and benefits. Managed by branch manager who was at best a mediocre banker at one pointe. Must be able to have every aspect of your work reviewed and second guessed by those who do not have the licenses or credentials that you may have. Very big disconnect between district banking team and the regional private bank. "
good,Management at my location was unlike anything I've ever encountered. There was no desire to teach or develop anyone and everything always got passed down because no one wanted to actually do the work.
good,they really like numbers and will do what they can to get them if you hit your numbers things are easy if no then they will make your job hard
good,"Assisting Operations Specialists with member and other department or branch research requests"
good,It went from being focused on quality and customer service which was what I personally loved. To only being about the sales and when it didn't benefit the customer it became a real issue. I have no problem with telling or sharing a product or benefit with anyone when it truly does help them. I have an issue with it when it makes you question integrity and being a just cause. I pray though that since I left that they have hopefully gotten back to being about the quality and customer service since they have gotten rid of some of those in higher positions that were pushing for this.
good,"Responsible for performing a variety of loan documentation duties on complex loans, using comprehensive knowledge of policies and procedures for loan products. "
good,My time there was very rewarding.  I leaned a lot regarding how to provide exceptional customer service.  There are a few individuals who do not adhere to the spirit of the company's culture and take certain liberties with their sales practices.
good,"Management was nice but..."
good,Job was temp position. Had to sit in a cubical all day and the job was very repetitive. Wells Fargo was gracious and provided free snacks and coffee.
good,"I wasn't suited towards that job as I was required to cut the conversations with my prospective clients short in order to help more people. "
good,"Pro's flexible hours"
good,"Wells Fargo Home Mortgage overall was a pretty great place to work.  I did have to work seven days a week quite often, due to working open houses. My typical Monday-Friday would consist of work from about 8:30am.-8pm.  I left because of a layoff in the company."
good,"Management was not very good about keeping you updated. They would tell you what you did wrong, but not how to fix it. I enjoyed all my coworkers. We were like a little family."
good,I learned how management lies and change rules that are not in accordance with policy than will let you go. There was nothing hard about the job other than the new management that came on board and made everything difficult.
good,Most enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers and when customers come to my branch and bring business because they love my service.
good,Research and analyze history of home repairs and insurance claims to determine future plan to transfer home back to HUD for re-sale
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Everyday at the location I was assigned was very busy, we were located within a busniess area were high volumes of transaction would take place.  Position requires the teller be very detailed with all transcation, little room for mistakes.  You are responsible dealing with large amounts of cash, so you have be very focused and watch every step so you can balance your cash drawer by day in."
good,As a teller you are forced to sell bank accounts. While I was there I worked for a small local branch with many regular customers. A new manager came in an pushed selling accounts on the teller to customers we saw everyday. Needless to say the sales were not that high as all the customers had been pushed relentlessly to open new accounts. I tired to explain this but the only care was the numbers. Also the compensation to the tellers for getting a customer to sit with an account specialist was $1 per account opened while the account specialist received a percentage 5 - 10% of the amount the account was opened with. Some of my accounts were $3k - $5k commissions for my account specialists. I did 90% of the work.
good,I learned how to sale banking and financial products to add value to my clients. I identified opportunities to help clients with their banking needs.
good,was ok to work for. one thing I did dislike was that I was not explained a lot just thrown into training with out a lot of guidance.
good,Good place to work over all hard to advance in the company. Took on many roles in the company from teller to Loss prevention . The most enjoyable part of the jobs was helping save homes.
good,Unrealistic sales goals with overstaffed branches. Great hours. Unethical practices of some employees or managers to meet sales goals
good,"Definitely a glass ceiling if you don't know the right people or have a degree no matter how long you work there or how dedicated you are. (Or drink of you are in Collections) Expect new middle management every 6 to 18 months who feels the need to create new guidelines and reorganize all of the departments and locations without taking the time to get to know the work or the people. More credit needs to go to the people doing the everyday work, in the trenches."
good,I enjoyed employment here as a first job. A fast paced environment in a strict setting with amazing management. Many acquired skills.
good,"Really great people and sane working hours, but frequent restructuring. Great benefits. Best big bank to work for. Major focus on teamwork."
good,"The pay is not great, especially on the operations side. There is a definite ceiling unless you want to go into sales. I am very disenchanted with this company, as I have worked here four years and outperformed many of my peers, yet still have not been given promotions/raises which have been promised to me by management. Very stressful environment to work in. Ultimately, the ""Together We Will Go Far"" vision could not be further from the truth. They do not have their customer's best interests at heart, the only thing that matters is sales numbers."
good,We are told to assess the customers needs but it is really for our own benefit.  Low base salary and low commission makes for a not so happy employee.  Goals are not able to be met since we are advised to push on customers in a saturated market.
good,"I was in charge of bringing in new business for Wells Fargo by way of refinancing mortgage and auto loans. I enjoyed the experience and loved the salary. Unfortunately, this was not a secure place to work. The first office I was hired for closed down and I was moved, and a couple of months later the second office closed. This time without being moved."
good,"Responsible for Customer satisfaction while handling large amounts of money on an everyday base. Customer service, reconciling cash drawer at end of each day, provide same duties as tellers in addition to handling compliance of audit operations and regulatory issues, workflow scheduling, transaction approvals, teller training and teller supervision."
good,"Work flow was busy and exciting. Making a positive difference in a person financial and personal life gave me  warm good feeling inside. Helping a customer to consolidate bills for a much lower interest rate and help them have a positive disposable income to survive each day was exhilarating. Sitting down with a customer or talking on the phone with a customer and talking to them about their families, friends, husbands, wife's and assisting them with their financial growth was a great experience everyday."
good,I am satisfied with current position but there's minimal opportunity for growth in current environment.  Recruiting efforts are ongoing but I'm looking for alternate opportunities.
good,"The experience at Wells Fargo has left only a sour taste in my mouth and I have hardly anything good to say about it. From the harassment to the discrimination to the applause for unethical behavior that may either get you rewarded or fired; this work environment is not conducive to anything positive."
good,"A typical Day is answering call and handling concerns"
good,no better or worse than anywhere else...employees are asked to do more and more each year in this market of companies striving to be lean.  No one does just one thing anymore so personal development is more diverse but has less depth than ever before.
good,"Respected and dedicated professional with experience in administrative areas, legal documentation, as well as numerous loan products for commercial and residential real estate. Possess exceptional writing, presenting and interpersonal communication skills.  Adept at assessing needs, generating options and implementing solutions to meet job requirements and the clients expectations.  High performing, energetic, very organized and ready to move upward to the next step in a successful career in Charlotte, NC."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Repetitive 10-key & sitting 99% of the time."
good,I would work here again.  It has great work life balance and opportunity to learn and grow.
good,"Good people working for the company, other than a few bad apples. My manager, in particular, was rarely at work on time and left early profusely, yet held everyone to an accountability of perfect attendance and punctuality to the minute. Very sales driven, though they like to hide behind the veil of customer service leading to sales. Otherwise, the best banking position I've held, and the easiest as far as tools for working (software and equipment were user friendly and did not break)."
good,"a typical day at work is processing transactions and insuring that customers needs are met"
good,"•  Manage a pipeline of delinquent loans"
good,"There is a significant restructuring in the HR Community at Wells Fargo.  The various functions within the HR roles are centralizing at the corportate level and timelines are staggered.  Overall, the centralization movement is a very slow process.  Individual goals are not aligning with the timeline for the changes in the organization thus I am seeking advancement opportunities outside the organization."
good,"This is a great company to move up in, excellent benefits. Wells Fargo sets the mark in banking whether its in service or sales. Saying that they don't pay you overtime but expect you to work six days a week, if you are up against your forty hours they'll ask you to take extended lunches. A business need will always take priority over anything family related, good luck getting an emergency day off. My store in particular they hired under qualified bankers instead of promoting over qualified tellers, they weren't even given the opportunity to apply for the positions. I have to say that all depends on the particular district manager. If you want to be in banking gain your experience here and then run."
good,"it was fun, fast paced but a lot of imformation to remember. it was always busy at the branch I worked at so that made time fly. the pay was low. 11.50. I do miss it at times but I don't like the mandatory Saturday. I worked 6 days a week"
good,"It's a decent place to work; not a lot of room for advancement, however"
good,"Loved working with people, so made my job enjoyable.  I learned about cash handling experience."
good,"A typical day was 7:30am to 4:00pm, I worked primarily independently on queues I was assigned to monitor. I would access databases designed to track bankruptcy proceedings. I would update the file, call attorneys if necessary and note the account."
good,"The management at WFC at least within the group that I worked with for most of my tenure, seemed to be very focused on who you are personally rather than paying attention to your level of professionalism or you actual abilities.  It was all too easy to be thrown under the bus by management if something went wrong and you made the mistake of accepting even partial responsibility for the mistake.  "
good,"Typical day was making outbound calls-either manually or with the automatic dialer or taking inbound calls.  Very little time to take a breather.  The training was a waste-It didn't have much to do with the actual job!  They taught us where to find the procedures so that we could work independently, which is fine.  However, when we had customers that wanted to speak to a supervisor, NO management wanted to take the call!  It was almost like high school - ""clicks"",  if management liked you-you were part of the ""in"" crowd!  Big turnover with employees."
good,This division of Wells Fargo is far from ideal.  Old company and old business model pretending to be innovative.
good,"The culture changes yearly, new focuses are rolled up monthly. The employees are great and a great opportunity for advancement."
good,Employees arrive ready to work. I learn the importance of team work and how working together results in success. Co-workers created a family environment which made working fun. The hardest part of my job was leaving any task undone at the end of the day. The most enjoyable part of my job was serving customers especially difficult or irate  individuals and seeing them leaving satisfied.
good,"Customer Experience: Created and implemented outstanding customer service experience to meet high sales objectives."
good,I worked on Collection's at Wells Fargo. I learned that collection's is not for me! Hardest part is calling and asking customers to pay the credit card they racked up and listening to them say they can't! When I worked there they had a decent bonus program. Management was good though
good,I worked in two different departments. I actually got displaced after nine years. I was able to come back full time within nine months only to be terminated after I was actually scheduled off. I felt because of my work ethics that they where nice enough to give me the day off and  the team would be short however they pull my calls based on a two hour work schedule mine you not a full eight hour day and said they noticed my talk time was low. Once they said my talk time was low those was grounds to pull my calls to say that I took short cuts to make my time low. I've said all of this to say if management don't like you and feel like you've been there long enough and not want to pay you retirement than your as good as gone the minute and opportunity opens up for them to let you go. The actual wire transfer with the customers was a pleasure. The hardest part of the job was trying to figure out a back to basic program of the do's and the don't and pushing calls over . To sum it all up for me was finding the quality and quantity in this job as far as the customer was concerned. The most enjoyable part of this particular job was satisfying the customer in a timely and efficient manner.
good,"Bad Pay, Bad work but lots of other benefits and co-curricular activies to do."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I have been here 2 years and there has been 3 major layoffs. The mortgage operations  citing lower demand for home mortgages. Especially during the winter season. my job is not guaranteed for my future and livelihood.
good,Some of the co workers was okay and fun some mangers as well was nice
good,"The job was fun I encountered practical engineering problems and I obtained a lot of exposure in the process. Nevertheless, the remuneration package was not sufficient."
good,I worked for HP and they had the contract for Wells Fargo Bank.  We provided their voice support.  Wells Fargo's contractual relationship with HP seemed to no always get followed .  HP still provided that support and maintained the SLA's.  We worked in a high volume fast paced environment.  I learned to adapt quickly and work on new platforms.
good,"Although they constantly say that you shouldn't sell a customer something they shouldn't need, associates are often under extreme pressure to make goals or lose their jobs. But if you're good at selling, it makes moving up in the company rather easy."
good,"Wells Fargo is not the worst place to work, but unfortunately this company is focuses on quantity rather than on quality. "
good,"Good people, but favoritism plays a huge role. Not that I had that problem, but for other s it may."
good,Ok financial institution for a early start in your career. Management depending on which branch you placed can very from place to place. Advancement in the company is very hard even when you are achieving your sales at certain branches while others vary. If you find yourself not moving up and making quarterly goals you may find yourself leaving and coming back and getting the role you actually want a better option.
good,can get a job with any wells fargo bank anywhere in the us after 1yr in current department.
good,You have to sell in order to keep your job. Had great co workers but if your not a sales person then this is not the job for you.
good,Working to make sure the customer is pleased with our service about the escrow calls
good,"Most busy days will be on Monday & Friday. It consists of high volume of customers and extensive internal office works."
good,"Was very busy and then started slowing down due to management. then had a hard time closing loans, and they let many people go due to the reduction of business due to loan issues"
good,"Challenging sales goals to push yourself to be better, but environment is not supportive to fair play.  Achievement is treated with suspicion of cheating."
good,I liked working for them. I would work for them  again except that they aren't hiring at this time.
good,"Mundane. Overworked. Little Pay. Culture good, but going down hill."
good,"Learning curve never stops here. Good Place to work."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Great company to work for if you can get with a good management team. Large company that will lay you off if the business decides to downsize.  Management is inconsistent. Politics is a large part of the corporate culture.  You will be asked to do more with less at every turn.  Good benefits.  Good chance to learn with employee development and tuition reimbursement programs.  It is a large bank that will present opportunities and challenges in a professional career with work life balance and self development.  Pay tends to be appropriate for the given market and titles.
good,"They say you can earn an extreme amount of money in bonuses but only 3 people get the bonus out of hundreds, being a top sales performer I was surprised when I missed the bonus by one technicality and that really affected my desire to continue growth with the company."
good,"open accounts, greet customers, handle customer concerns and issues"
good,attached to the phone  and time tracked for everything. even using the rest room
good,"The companies main focus is sales and pushing to offer things that really are not needed but with boost numbers. Management works in a numbers pep talk whenever they can because if you don't meet your quota then neither do they."
good,"It was fine except when they mixed up on the time zones."
good,They play politics and you have to get in good with someone in order to advance. Benefits are great.
good,"Processing customer complaints and determining which mortgage account they are referencing, lots of research using several systems. Write report and forward file to case worker to contact the customer on resolution"
good,"Wells Fargo is a large and is a good company, depending on the department worked could be very demanding and stressful."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,I worked on the HAMP modification process which was constantly changing.  Wells did their best to keep us informed and up to date with regulations and requirements.
good,"with all the changes in mortgage industry in the past few years, reform, etc., a lot of customers would be combative about the paperwork and time involved in process."
good,"Every company has its pros and cons, but overall, I had a positive work experience at Wells Fargo Insurance."
good,"very sales and goal oriented. slightly difficult to maintain home life and progress in the company due to the hours they request you work, work schedules mainly include weekends and night when wanting to progress"
good,"A typical day at work was trying to get through the day without being a focus point. Either bad or good, expectations were set from your previous faults or successes. One slip and your confidence is lost within the branch. "
good,"typical day at work was sales sales sales "
good,Most enjoyable part is helping great people across the nation and make them feel good about resolving their issues. Worked with some great people from a co-worker and customer standpoint.
good,"Overworked, underpayed. Over stressed, underpayed. SALES SALES SALES. Wells taught me a lot which enabled me to go elsewhere. A great place to start but not a great place to stay."
good,I learnt how to work with people including management. The most joyful part was when I was able to help customers
good,"Overall not a horrible, but I was surprised how little all banks paid their employees."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"High pressure of sales goals, poor management skills to help push and commit to helping tellers and other positions at the bank to reach sales goals. very sales oriented and not very in tune with customers and actual needs. Job security felt as if it was based off of sales and how many sales you made per quarter (every 3 months) "
good,If you don't like sells you won't like this job very pushy with sales ! Everything else is okay it comes with it's perks.
good,"When I first started at Wells Fargo, I was under different management which was extremely supportive, motivating, and even if you disagreed with a decision, management respected the employees with explanations that made sense.  Due to a change of direction in underwriting, a few of my colleagues and I were grandfathered within a different group because of our abilities to truly underwrite applications. I love my team, they are a work family and we get along well.  We can bounce ideas off each other and help sort out difficult SOPs and policies to avoid audits.  We are a true unit and has survived a lot of change in a short time. My direct report also was moved into our group, and I absolutely adore her.  She works hard to take care of our team because she still carries the values of our previous V.P. However, our new V.P. is now making our lives miserable.  Often our questions are not answered,  promises were made that after two years are still not kept, there is an unbalanced focus on the three teams that report to the V.P. and that is causing undue burden on our team. Mandatory overtime without proper notice due to failures of proper training and staffing of the other offices have been made.  New hires have a higher title and income with less experience in the product. This is causing low morale and downright anger because  underwriters on my team make less money, have lower titles, and more work cleaning up poorly underwritten applications from the larger, inexperienced and badly trained new staff.  The bonus and monthly evaluation structure is also unfair. Judgmental underwriting"
good,Overall good job. Reaching sales goals extremely important
good,Assisted customers with their banking and financial portfolio.
good,"Glorified telemarketer (Central Sales). You are on the phone calling WF customers, which the majority of them do not want to talk to you or have an ongoing problem with WF. The management team is full of false hope, just trying to motivate the sales team to reach sales goals that really only benefits management. You learn to hate corporate America and especially your cube. I did well at WF but left for a better job...I really don't recommend working for Central Sales unless you absolutely have to."
good,The retail side of Wells Fargo is always changing and there is a high turn over of upper management.  This makes the day-to-day activities very complicated and ever changing.
good,"I partner with Relationship Managers in four different states to service ultra high market value trusts and agency accounts for affluent clients."
good,worked my way though the company by starting in the grave yard shift working from 11 at night to 6 in the morning. learned how to working in a team environment.
good,Took calls assisted with balances and transfers. Made financial recommendations. Hardest part of job was dealing with customers with financial issues. Most enjoyable part of job was making customers happy. Management was always helpful.
good,My experience at Wachovia was a good one in which I obtained my first banking working experience.  The reason I left was because of the lack of pay and the tedious nature of teller duty.  I needed a greater challenge and my plan of advancement through the ranks fell short due to the lack of turn over during my length of stay.
good,My overall day consists of interacting with customers maintaining  their accounts and any other banking needs. In interacting with different people daily it allows me to learn diversity to better serve and deliver personalized service to fit specific needs. I love delivering quality service to my customers and it gives me a sense of accomplishment when my customers are pleased with my efforts. I also like being a team player mostly a team leader building the moral of my coworkers.
good,"Typical day at work involves checking voicemails, email, and database for documents. I analyze that paperwork being submitted for underwriter review and if it's complete per government and company guidelines I submit it for next level review. I learned how to provide solutions for customers who are going through hardships due to various conditions. Management is consistent for the most part. Co-workers are also consistent with adhering to company policy from time to time. The hardest part of this job is maintaining equal amounts of time for every task that one has been given throughout the daily process. The most enjoyable part is being able to save homes by giving modifications to customers who were in dire need due to external circumstances."
good,"Maintained a courteous and professional manner with incoming customer/peer calls with commercial / personal debit card disputes along with pin/signature based fraud claims."
good,"Customer Service"
good,"Greet customers and co-workers."
good,Wells Fargo has a lot of opportunity to develop your career.
good,"My typical day will be to take inbound and outbound call for mortgage clients who are looking to pay there mortgage, look for payment assistance or ask general questions about products and services offered by Wells Fargo.  It can be fast-past but there are day when it is very slow.  I have learned a lot about mortgages, and the loan types.  My co-workers are young and energetic and keep me laughing the whole day."
good,"Management was okay, although if you needed any sort of scheduling change they were no help. They were also always very busy and if any advice or help was needed they would refer you to the team leads although they're power and access to the systems were very limited. And working one Saturday every 3 weeks is mandatory no matter what. The people there were great and you have no trouble making friends there. The collecting part is rough, always trying to hound people for money isn't the funnest job in the world. They do have a cafe but it's very pricey."
good,"always in a changing environment and/or new processes.  great opportunity for making money with all the overtime and bonuses, but took time away from family"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Management was very much a micro-management style, I personally believe that work defines us and our ability to succeed at our work can truly make us happy. With that said, I find micro-management to be counter-productive."
good,"Once the switch happened from Wachovia to Wells Fargo things got much more hostile and the environment became unbearable. otherwise job is very easy, hours are nice, and pay is decent."
good,our shift changes depending on the workforce and decisions of the management. my bosses are strict. but through this company i learned that integrity is non-negotiable.
good,"In my honest opinion, there is no such thing as a typcial day at Wells Fargo. Depending on who and when you ask, you may receive several responses about the job. I learned a lot in the 7 plus years I was employed. I worked with a plethora of Managers and Co-Workers with their own individual believes and personalities. One of the most difficult aspects of this job was the constant changing of procedures, rules, and standards. What was acceptable Tuesday morning may not be the same by the day's end. So in some extent it kept things ""Fresh and exiciting"", but on the same token it cause a lot of frustration and confusion. The managers didn't always to take the time to explain it thoroughly, rather a trial and error situation that can become disastrous especially in the Finance field. In my time there I worked in three different departments, but I always felt like there were no real advancements to be made, just lateral movements."
good,"Busy day at work constantly servicing customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and greeting the customers and cooking. There is really hard part about this job. It is fast paced, but that is what I'm used to. I learned to stay focus and do my job and provide the best possible service to my customers"
good,"Currently manage a staff of fourteen bankers, two RBPB’s, three service managers, a Store Manager 1, and between fifteen to eighteen tellers. Since being at the Parker Location have made a huge impact into the development of the Douglas District management team with half of the Store Managers in the district having been developed under my management here at Parker. I have been in charge of running the weekly Wow call for the district where each store manager and there store champion gets on and we have a robust discussion around their store wow and deploy and assess their activities. In the two years at Parker my team has been able to grow deposits $71 million dollars, increase our high value households by 238, and raise our NIAT $536 thousand. Have also been able to achieve coaches bonus every quarter since taking over Parker."
good,"The co-workers and culture was great.  The pay was good as well.  Expected to work very long hours, and unreasonable expectations.  For example you are working hard, 70 hours a week and timelines were not met.  WF says why didn't you work 80 hours?  I understand on occasion working long hours may be expected however when it is your day to day it is not good."
good,"•	Build relationships and provide expert financial advice and great service."
good,Not much to elaborate on.  Its a basic call center atmosphere.
good,"A typical work day would start with regular trading application production issue."
good,There is lots of freedom but this is not for an individual who does not self motivated.
good,After 14 yrs and a few mergers my work atmosphere is no longer healthy.
good,"Validating mortgage servicing files."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of lots of changes which is ok. I learned so much at this company. Wells Fargo overall was a GREAT company to work for, however. management was terrible. I would definitely go back under different management."
good,I had several job positions at Wells Fargo. The opportunity for advancement was there.
good,"They the revolving door affect, they teach one way of doing things and it changes weekly. Constant huge changes that you have to keep up with no job security for entry level, only mangers supervisors and general managers"
good,"VERY high pressured workplace.  Much is expected. Fast-paced and ever-changing.  Presently, turnover is high.  Co-workers are nice.  Learning to be able to change gears quickly.  Have met many very nice people here.  We are now experiencing a turnover in employees.  Each day brings a lot of change and challenges. My manager has been helpful"
good,"start the day with conference calls and huddle than prepare the team to be ready to open , start reviewing reports and organize and reply e-mails available to support and coach the team also to care about clients overall handling complex situation and solving problems, coaching on the spot and informal meetings with the team.  have to prioritize tasks to provide excellent service to the clients and maintain the team motivate and engage, make appointments with companies to visit them and educate financially the employees, review operation and have meeting to the operation manager to make sure the good functionality of the business, in general be responsible to excel in all business areas and provide an outstanding results of the business daily, weekly and quarterly."
good,Over all the pay is low compared to other similar jobs with other companies such as Green Tree that starts collectors at $16 hr.  Emvironment is very professional and management does encourage movement with in the organization.
good,I enjoyed coming to work the crew we had over 9 years together where fun and hard working.. I learned a lot from this job and appreciate all that was given by Wachovia
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"A typical day at work includes providing exceptional customer service to our clients, opening new accounts, processing loans, making daily outbound sales calls, and to ensure the daily operations of the financial institution are within compliance. I have learned that assisting clients with their daily financial solutions as well as their future financial goals is very important. It gives the client a peice of mind and a sense of trust to know that someone who has the skills and capability will be their guide in assisting them with all of their financial needs. Management is important in every company because the manager provides daily structure and order to the team. My co-workers were hard workers and we all worked together as a team to contribute to everyone's success. The hardest part of my job was preparing for the audits. It was a very intense time when we knew we had to prepare for a bank audit the day before it actually happens, however we would always receive a passing score. The most enjoyable part of my job was being that banker that was able to assist my everyday clients. It gave me great pleasure to provide them with the level of service that they expect and deserve."
good,"Management ""manages up"". It is difficult to feel like someone is advocating for you. Projects are often chaotic and ever-changing. Nobody knows who is in charge."
good,I was responsible for preparing change orders and balancing a large volume of cash on a daily basis.
good,"If you're into forcing people to buy things that could potentially ruin their lives then this is the job for you. If you're into management that doesn't care about your feelings and doesn't know what positive reinforcement is, this job is for you. If you are able to put your personal feelings aside and work for a money hungry bank, this job is for you. Wells Fargo doesn't give two donkeys about their employees and only cares on the number of referrals or warm transfers (to sales) that you get. If you have a bad day? Oh well that's not good news for you, be prepared to have somebody on your rear the entire day."
good,Wells Fargo is a bank that really focuses on sales numbers and percentages. it gives you an opportunity to start a career in a more structured environment.
good,"It's busy everyday and it's a great amount of repetition, however no day is the same. It's fun and challenging and there is lots of room for growth. I don't personally agree with the sales part of it all but it is a bank and that's hwo they work and survive.  I believe more in giving the member what they need to be finanicially fit not set them up for disaster in order to get a bonus on your check. Management is good but also very assertive with the sales goals. They almost seem impossible sometimes.  The team works as a team and lives by the saying, ""leave no man behind."""
good,I really enjoyed the benefits of the company that would be the biggest factor to work with Wells Fargo. The culture has went down hill since the conversion of Wachovia to Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo hours are not good for a family and lots of pressure to sell and refer items to customers more so than to help the customers. The pressure of selling can cause anxiety and it is hard to move out of phone positions with the company.
good,"OSC is a very fast paced call center, very easy to get burned out, quickly. Management is never the same. Constantly switching teams. HR is a joke, the don't take concerns very seriously. Lots of pressure to make sales. Sales became #1 focus, ethics thrown out the window."
good,Learned a lot at Wells Fargo and enjoyed my time there.  I was there for almost 2 years and couldn't of asked for anything more and hope that I can move my skills to a new company in the future.
good,This is a great job for any college students looking to gain knowledge of banking and finance
good,Good pay and benefits. Reverse discrimination.  Anti Christian values and rules. Met a lot of great people.
good,"Taking orders all day"
good,Loved the job & work environment but got laid off after the demand was no longer there.  Wells Fargo just over hire intentionally knowing they are going to lay off their employees.
good,working in the retail stores was beneficial i thoroughly enjoyed that but once i left the retail side of wells fargo management went down and was the worst decision i made leaving the stores.
good,"Busy, customer service with sales goals.Handle situations professionally with serious work environment."
good,A great place to work and grow if you like and are dedicated to sales and working towards steep goals.
good,"From day 1, you should make sure you know the in s & outs, otherwise, most team members will take advantage of your lack of knowledge."
good,"Identify and Manage customers needs to establish effective financial solutions"
good,"I learned a lot there, worked there for 26+ years, started from high school as a reconciler, settling bank deposits, later maintained data bases for monthly volumes, which were distributed to management. In last years became work director. Love work with numbers and issues."
good,"Typical Day at Wells Fargo- A typical day at wells fargo consist of assisting customers, upselling the customers accounts, offering them better product. Cashing Checks, Processing Money Orders/ Bank Checks, deposits, withdraws in a hectic enviroment."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"At first this job was exciting but quickly realized it required heavily on meeting sales goals. For the most part I was able to meet goals. I have no problem being in sales but I just didn't enjoy feeling like I had to beat sales from customers or pester them with the same sale attempt questions each time I saw them. Gained a lot of professionalism experience, customer service experience and communication skills."
good,"I worked in a small town branch and the goals were the same as in a city branch. The people and management were great to work with, but, they expected you to 'sell' add-ons and upgrades even when it was not the best choice for the customer."
good,"Been there for 7 years with 3 years in retail banking.  Retail banking is a horrible place to work for unless you like that type of micro management, sales environment.  Once I went into corporate banking, it was better.  My manager was awesome and very supportive but unfortunately, there was not much room for advancement.  It did not help that internal transfers or promotions did not provide much of a raise or compensation.  It is true what they say about how people have to leave to another company and then go back in order for them to get paid more."
good,"customer care up front working the teller line making sure customers have what they need and profiling for product placement. Setting appointments and calling customers. "
good,"Review pipeline and follow up on files.  Call clients with status or email, whichever contact method they prefer.  Answer team questions and go over policy and guidelines on programs.  Make sales calls to realtors.  Work on different referral partner programs with 3rd party vendors."
good,"Wells Fargo has been a good company to work for, they have very high goals which are attainable but are hard to reach.  Life/work balance is not good, if you are a single parent or a small family trying to stay together, this is not a good place to work.  There is a lot of micro-management and people are promoted to positions that are not fitting for them, such as a manager with poor people skills."
good,When I worked at this company it was great but not enough hours
good,"I had a good and bad experince at Wells Fargo. Great Pay excellent benefits , many great Managers . But when it comes to the Top Dogs , no comment . Sales pressure is insane , Everyone is unhappy , Sales goals are crazy it makes people sick , to the point they go on Stress Leave ! I think people like me hold on to this job and deal with the stress due to the great benefits & pay ! but my advice DONT DO IT"
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo Bank is helping customers financially."
good,Wells Fargo is a great company for a single individual looking for a career start.  It has been my experience that they are not a family oriented company.  I enjoyed my time with Wachovia starting fresh out of college and advanced quickly in my career.  It is very important to interview your manager before you accept a position.  The most enjoyable part of the job is making a difference in the lives of other employees and customers.
good,"I gained great skills at Wells Fargo specifically working swiftly and accurately and building relationships with people. However, the sales culture is a bit too much for me. I did not advance in the company by choice however I don't think the sales culture decreases in upper level positions."
good,"Wells fargo is a great company, However they can become more like pest when you are trying to learn all the information and get into the flow of things. They focus more on sales than customer satisfaction"
good,"A great work environment with outstanding leadership. The day to day work of helping clients overcome their financial difficulties was an outstanding opportunity to learn how to build trust and exercise good judgement. It was a very enjoyable opportunity but I was quickly discouraged when I saw how the advancement worked. While the immediate, in-store, leadership was an excellent example the opportunity for advancement was based simply on 'who you know' rather than tangible results."
good,"Very hard working people here at Wells Fargo with not a lot of work during the day. constantly running out of work but incredible co-workers, a manager who truly cares about you as an individual and the hours are great."
good,I learned a great deal about the mortgage industry and the processes in which one must go through to obtain or refinance the home they currently own.  
good,"Everybody in the company is replaceable."
good,"Wells Fargo was a decent company to work for, although in my department there is no universal guidelines on how one group can be successful versus another. "
good,"Hardest part is Support environment."
good,"call and sell bonds. alot about fixed income. management was fine but will get rid of you, even if you produce, in order to make their bonuses."
good,My typical day is spent receiving conventional conforming loan files for both initial and final underwriting reviews. I am in constent communication with loan processors and loan officers in order to provide updates on files. 
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Underwrite consumer mortgage loan refinance requests. I enjoy the people that I work with and the job that I do.
good,Good company to work for if you are interested in the banking industry.
good,"The company as a whole is a wonderful company however my manager is not at all familiar with the word ""Confidentiality"". She discussed everyone's personal business with all of her subordinates."
good,"Wells Fargo, along with any other bank is based on selling. If you do not like selling then steer away from this field."
good,"Typical day would start off making sure all the fixed income systems I supported were up and ready for the portfolio managers to begin their day. Once that was finished I would start my day as a Project Manager working on various projects or step in as a Business Analyst and help write procedures for new projects. The management had an idea as to what they wanted to accomplish, but the funding was never there. I enjoyed my co-workers and loved working with them."
good,I love what I do. Management is unfair. The hardest part of my job is constantly going above and beyond with recognition. The most enjoyable part is knowing I do what I do well.
good,"Sorting and Distributing Mail, Entering Information into databases. I learned alot of things such as Filing, Shipping and Receiving, and Operating all mailing machines.."
good,"worked in close-knit, friends and family favored office that allowed managers to openly patronize and ridicule employees. rules of engagement changed with the wind."
good,"A typical work day would be plan out by scheduling your time with appointments, outgoing calls, service issues, and work compliance. I learn to management my time, how to prioritize to be more effective with my work tasks, how to ""peeling the onion"" and over come objections. Management would always start off good and friendly but when your store did not perform well, management would be torn down morally by the next level of management and the morale of the store would not be positive. Working just in one year with wells far I went through four managers. So, there was no consistantacy. Typically the coworker where great and most part felt like family to work with. Hardest thing about the job was getting people to show up for their appointments. Most enjoyable part was serving the customer to help them to achieve financial success and getting praise for it."
good,Very comfortable workplace with very reasonable hours and reasonable pay.
good,"Received wonderful experience. Upper level management was poor and unclear when making large layoffs, but it's about what you would expect for working with a large company"
good,Banking for one of the largest US Bank. Liked working there just didnt get paid good enough.
good,great job to have right out of college. Great co workers. They did have extremely high expectations with are leads they offered.
good,It was a corporate type job. I learned how to work with money on a daily basis. Learned about investments. Loved that i was in a full time job with great people!
good,"This job was one I took after the mortgage business went south. I hadn't worked with an bank that provided saving accounts or interest bearing accounts before. I had plenty of experience in helping people with their mortgage needs. So, I figured it would be somewhat similar. It was sales based job with some customer service attached. People would call in to my workplace needing some sort of service. I would profile them for products they didn't have as I provided them their customer service. I did very well, and I always met or exceeded my numbers. The hardest part of the job was actually working every weekend and not being able to spend time with my family. I enjoyed the sales aspect of the job and my co-workers"
good,"A typical day consisted of processing deposits, withdrawls, transfers, foreign exchange, servicing the ATM, safe audits, and customer referrals. The hardest part of my job was sales, in regards to products that customers did not need, and would be charged for. My coworkers were amazing and we were a happy team."
good,a typical day at work was very tidious.i learned how to manage money there.my management team was very tactful.my co-workers always enjoyed my company.there was no hard part.the most enjoyable part was helping the customers succeed financially
good,"My job was difficult, being in the foreclosure department. Telling people that they have to move out their house. It was depressing after a while. And management did not make it easy."
good,"Paid medical claims all day, with was mundane. They days went by slow, but did enjoyed the other staff."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"A typical day at work: Walk the teller line to get customers to my desk, whether it's for service or making a sale. I profile customers to offer them products and services that meet their every day lifestyle and also build srtong relationship."
good,Their overall goal was to save the client money by having minimal state-side workers and off shoring work to India. They had room for improvements but overall ok company.
good,Company is customer oriented...typical day at work results in productivity...Learned to adhere to policy and procedures ONLY...Management is acceptable...Co-workers are team players...Hardest part of the job is adjusting to the constant daily verbal changes or written.
good,"A typical day starts of busy, learing what is going on for the week, meetings, projects, training, etc. There is always something new to learn in this changing environment. The process today can be a thing of the past tomorrow. Co- workers are team players for the most part, sharing information, and pitching in where needed. Management is helpful at times, employees are not always given the authority to own a problem or situation, rather encouraged to use the chain of command. I would say the hardest part of the job is running into obsticles that could delay the completion of a task. Learning who the SME is or resource to get the task done. The most enjoyable part would be getting an acknowlegement of a job well done."
good,Working with clients with different values and making sure they are reaching their financial goals. The hardest part is selling over the phone due to low walk-in traffic the limited amount of products to be offered in this economy.
good,What I like about working at Wells Fargo is that they have a
good,"Wells Fargo has for decades enjoyed a low risk, sales & service-based bank branch business acquisition model on the consumer side. That model is now under pressure both from expense and growth expectations. They are just now addressing the cuts they needed to make after Wachovia, 3 years later. The current growth strategy is an untested, radical departure from what has worked in the past. It is especially radical considering their very conservative tradition- expect some breakage soon."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was working with a team. Had a lot of team mentoring. I learned how the financial technical platforms of data were so secure for their clients and anyone working on the project to migrate from one platform to another.
good,I would typically talk with 70-80 people a day over the phone about their bank accounts and helping them add on more bank related products. I learned how to avoid overdraft fees and how to balance my money better working at a bank.
good,How to juggle several tasks on a daily basis. In prior jobs I was assigned duties that needed to be completed on a daily basis but nothing compared to the duties that have to be performed in a bank. I learned to play close attention to my tasks and make sure I don't commit any mistakes.
good,"Work with clients in an inbound and outbound sales atmosphere establishing and servicing new and existing personal insurance policies including: personal auto, homeowners, dwelling, umbrella, motorcycle, RV, renters, and other sport vehicles. Serve as a mentor to new agents on the job assisting with sales and systems development. Consistently meet and surpass monthly agent incentive sales goals while mentoring and assisting existing agents and agents new to the department. Agents under my guidance have met and surpassed monthly sales incentives. Develop relationships and recommend products to protect individual assets and well being. Develop new customer relationships through inbound and outbound calls as well as instruct and collaborate with personal bankers in retail branches to service and uncover customer insurance needs to protect our customer base."
good,same as other one reveiw but with teller line more cash handling
good,Too many changes due to the mortgage market. Nothing in place to support the loan officers.
good,"Great company to work for, unfortunate that there were so many lay offs."
good,"typical day: make daily schedule of breaks, lunches, customer service hourly representation, and goals; open branch; conduct business; maintain hourly checkins with entire team, manage breaks and lunches, continue checkins, communicate via email throughout day, communicate with upper management for effectiveness and next day goal, weekly goal, monthly goal and quarterly goals."
good,Great place to learn financial sales
good,The job is difficult. Customer are hard to handle and complain about everything. I learned how to handle every different situation possible.
good,Reviewed loans for any potential errors that may cause financial restitution to be granted.
good,Being a teller is the most difficult and under paid job ever. There is alot that takes place behind the scenes that customers are not aware of.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The Company as a whole Is not bad you just have to choose the best department for you to work In.
good,The job itself was rewarding in the sense that our team helped achieve the goal of getting families into their new homes. We typically took 70+ couple minute calls from mortgage consultants and specialists a day and provided simple information/statuses and completed VOES for the majority of calls. The environment was pleasantly casual and my teammates were very enjoyable.
good,I enjoyed working for Wachovia. I resigned before the Wells Fargo buy out due to unrelated issues.
good,Very aggressive sales. Requires a strong sales background to be successful.
good,"Wells Fargo is a sales driven company. they charge higher than usually and thrive on the ""sub-prime"" lending. salesmen are encouraged to get prime customer to take sub-prime rates."
good,"Working at the Wells Fargo Phone Bank was a lot of fun. The managers and supervisor's are great and the co-worker's all seem to get along pretty well. It's the things that happen throughout the day that use to bring each and every one of us down! If it wasn't our bonus they were taking away, they were getting rid (or making worse) our health benefits). By taking away our bonus, I mean Quality Assurance would find a reason to fail you on a call. and bring down an average score by mere percentage points..and there goes your $3000 bonus. It simply didn't seem right. The second down side was the fees they were charging to the consumer's accounts. I won't go into it now, only to say that I found myself empathizing with the customer's, making excuses for the bank, and feeling a little bitter myself as I, myself am a Wells Fargo account holder. I like our customer's to much to lie to them. Now let me be clear on something, I was promoted from customer service into the sales dept after my first year. I was one of six. There were 99 applicants. There was a time when I was very proud of my position, A time when I believed I was helping people. But I was wrong. Then to add insult to injury, we are to encourage people with bad credit to apply for all loans, personal lines of credit and credit cards. Yes, this will lower their credit scores, however if we discourage them from applying, that's a violation of Regulation B..and a ZERO call for the banker. The customer just wants someone to give them some honest advice. Don't we all hope we get that from our financial advisers? I certainly don't"
good,Working here was exciting and different each day. Co-workers for the most were approachable and easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job was advancement.
good,"Awful training, and too pushy on sales. I enjoy the people that I work with however, my bosses seems incapable of doing a good job teaching/coaching me in what to actually do. This is a good job and wish it was better. Another component is that it is not exactly what I want to do for the rest of my life and it could work for some people it just does not work for me."
good,"My last position with Wells Fargo was a very stressful, deadline driven, 100% accuracy required job. These were things that were directly attached to the management for which I worked. I enjoyed my job (as I do all my jobs) and looked forward to going to work for the most part. I was able to mesh with most of my co-workers, however, the younger ones seemed to have a clique of their own. This didn't really bother me, since I understood the age difference and when they had more complicated issues, they felt comfortable to come to me for assistance. Contact with my clients on a daily basis was an absolute. After all, they deserved the consideration of being updated on any issue and reassurance that their issue was not falling between the cracks. I provided all documents, presentations and other clerical needs for my consultants. I found that routine tasks were the basis of my job and looked forward to doing special projects or system testing."
good,I have met a great deal of interesting people here. My supervisor was helpful in my acclamation in the company.
good,"I have worked with them for 19yrs,was a good place to work. In the past few years has be come very very agressive in sales, which has become very stressful for a lot of employess. This has lead to a high turnover in jobs"
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo consists of an overly busy environment. There is VERY little time to think or breathe, overall the work is very fast paced and calls pour in one after the other. The most enjoyable part of the job is that there are televisions, gaming consoles, and foosball tables to enjoy at break times. The management is consistent of a call center and they micromanage very closely."
good,If you have to ready to do whatever it takes to make your numbers because the goal setting Wells Fargo has is impossible compare to other banking companies.
good,Meet your quarterly requirements. Solict new business. Do offsites. call on potential customer over the phone
good,"Answered phones, made outbound calls, greeted customers, enforced WF policy as it pertains to fees, opened and closed accounts and safety deposit boxes, ordered checks."
good,Banking needs are what most American needs. making sure that every customer has what they need and I was as pleasant as possible. I learned alot about the banking services. Some of the management were great and others took advantage of some of the tellers skills. If you go above and beyond and learn everything then you should be an asset not just another teller. Some didnt think that way. The co-workers most of them worked as a team and not as a one person duo. The hardest part of the job was making sure to count your money both ways not to give to much or not enough as to make your drawer over or short. The enjoyable part is making sure the customer walks away happy and content.
good,"A typical work day would be reviewing files and loan documentation,guidelines and getting the file Clear to close!"
good,"A typical day revolves around viewing several thousand mortgage document images on a computer screen. All the documents from each home loan must be separated and labeled according to how the many different users of this information wish. Since there are so many different users of this information, standards for how documents should be labeled change often."
good,Hard to balance personal and work related issues with close minded managers
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"OK place to work, not much in house training. You know what you know coming in, and then reach out from there."
good,"A typical work day included: referring products and services to customers, handling customer's transactions, handling cash, providing excellent customer service, etc. At this job I learned that building customer relationships is very important and keeping their business is also important. Management was great. Co-workers helped one another to gain success. The hardest part of the job was sales because sometimes customers didn't want any other products other than the ones they already had. I had to learn how to persuade the customers along with meeting their needs. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people and learning new things."
good,"Good comany to work for if you are looking for a steady job without advancement. Low salaries and they request you to be discrete at all times. Theyu will keep you if you behave and if they need you, if not, they will not hesitate to let you go."
good,Would be a great place to work if goals weren't so extreme. Company has made it harder to be able to comp out for quarterly bonuses which than leads to not being able to get a raise or get promoted. Training makes it seem that its all about service but when you actually start working your forced to come up with ridiculous sales goals which makes you wonder what happen to service... Management is lazy and are not willing to coach and develop. There more into nit picking and discouragement and un-motivational
good,bought out by Wells Fargo. No longer a bank. Was a good place to work.
good,"There are daily goals that consist of checking, savings, and debt cards. This bank doesn't focus much on overall revenue."
good,A company with good culture and values. Has great incentive and vacation package
good,"Decent pay for entry level position"
good,"Wells has always been responsive to questions and issues, both online and through my local bank. Their fraud department is first rate. When my credit card was compromised, they responded immediately with a new card and did not hold me liable for any of the charges."
good,I have met some incredible people while working with Wells Fargo. I will never regret the time I have worked with the company so long and 2 times over just because of the people I have gotten to know over the course of time.
good,"My coworkers were nice. However, the work wasn't very challenging. I spent two hours doing work and the rest of they day doing nothing. Also if I found opportunities to help improve processes, the opportunities would be taken away by a coworker and manager."
good,"The job procedures were not hard to learn. The way that the productivity hours of work was calculated was not accurate at the time I was employed there. I didn't find out until I was let go that the productivity aspect had been calculated wrong in the system. I really "
good,It was a difficult environment due to the mortgage meltdown.  Loss Mitigation is tough. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to save someone's home.
good,Okay. Sales were pushed. I think they have changed that. Management was at times unprofessional. Clients where not the nicest/ could have been the area I was in.
good,"The company is good but management can be a bit disorganized. You meet people every day. Their office of work is small , so everybody know each other. Team engagement is not really what it supposed to be. You can be feeling bad about how other teammates treat you sometimes but overall it’s a great company. The best thing Is to meet cool customers. We have fun in communicating with them."
good,I worked there and made a lot of money.  When management see's you as a threat though they will get rid of you no matter how valuable an employee you are.
good,This is a good company to work for. The opportunities to move up are hard to come by as it is very competitive.  I have learned a lot about the industry and feel confident in my skills.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Amazing company to work for- given the right management. The company itself"
good,"excellent work life balance , no much opportunuties to learn , dont advice to join as contractors as they do not internet access and very baised traetment ."
good,"Good people, but dishonest practices and expectations.  Great benefits, good training, and potential upward mobility.  However, the sales goals (at the time) were unreasonable for a small town branch."
good,Good company as far as compensation. However at time you feel replaceable despite exceeding all expectations. Lots of turnover in many departments. Be prepared for continuing change.
good,I have enjoyed working for Wells Fargo. I have been with Wells Fargo a little over two years and they have really taken care of me. It is a great company to work for.
good,"Great company and benefits. 2 cafeterias, comfortable lounge areas, lunch rooms. Wages are great. They are consistently grooming you for further development."
good,Too restrictive. I felt like I was going to work with my hands tied behind my back. Hard to actually do my job with all their security requirements. My team was getting locked out the computer all the time. Very difficult to get their accounts reactivated.
good,Fast paced team to work on. Have to keep up to the demands of clients and the product partners. Wells had a good reputation when I was there. Great people to work with.
good,"Company was great place to start right out of college. But depending on what group you go into, room for advancement is very limited and political. Most of the people there are people who have been there 10+ years. A lot of turnover with the analyst/associate roles."
good,"I organize all the files, incoming and outgoing correspondence for compliance, I deposit all the checks for the day and organize all the breakfast and lunch meetings for the office."
good,"The positives about working at Wells Fargo are that you get the sense that you are working as a team to complete your tasks and that there are many benefits. On the other hand, the negatives about working there in my opinion outweigh the positives. They are not very lenient in terms of your schedule and almost every week I saw myself working at least 10 hours more than I originally wanted. Also your sick days are very limited so use them wisely."
good,Wells Fargo is a good company to work for. There are alot opportunities to grow with the company. My manager was very  flexible and had an open door policy.
good,This was the first time I had an opportunity to work from home.  It was a nice experience even though it was short term.  My position did bring value in helping to get new team members up to speed in their new jobs.
good,I learned more about customer service and sales. My service manger and lead teller where a big part of my growth at Wells Fargo. My dudes where to talk to customers as they walk in to the branch. Make large deposit  to customers account and balance after every shift.
good,"Poor leadership. Lack of communication. No teamwork. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, What do you say about a company that wasn't all that exciting?"
good,Earlier it was good but in recent time its not great to work.In case if we want make a technical shift from one stream to other stream its almost hurculaine taks
good,"great Place to start your career."
good,"How much you like your job really depends on the branch that you work for. I've worked at three branches in five years and all three had different management styles and three different atmospheres. Some are more casual and fun, while others are micro-managed by insecure management that will only help out when they get something out of it too (ulterior motives). I have applied to 19 other positions in the last 3 months to transfer out of my branch and the manager keeps stone-walling me and refuses to allow growth in my career path because it would mean she'd lose a valuable and knowledgeable employee. Higher ups are EXCELLENT and really do care about you for the most part (district managers are also hit or miss). Benefits are excellent even though HRA keeps increasing their copayments each year. I felt like I had adequate training and know how to do my job well. Here towards the end, I feel undervalued and unappreciated. I've seen managers with seven years of experience get fired with no notice for trivial mistakes, so the job security in the company is minimal. They are also the lowest paying corporate bank for all personal banker jobs. Go to BOA or somewhere you can still make commission and have opportunity for advancement."
good,not fun working there manager was not good at all other workers were not but the specific team I worked with was not nice to me. They don't treat contractor with respect especially my manager
good,I dont want to right  a review - this is a bad requirement.  No person should be giving a standard review of a past employer on a website.  These should only come in a face to face and should be tempered with tact.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Great local team and local managers. Benefits and pay are top in market. It is a large bank and your voice is not heard. There is a lot of restructuring and changes internally.
good,Not much room for growth. If you are looking for a position that can challenge you and help you grow them this is not the place for you.The work culture is relaxed however management is not very open to suggestions to improve the processes.
good,"generally positive place to work. The DUC or distribution and utility center is the national mailroom for Wells Fargo nationally, and is over one million square feet."
good,I was only there for a month and a half switching out printers it seemed good doing that job.The building was big and people were nice. I took some printers and either relocated them or replaced them.
good,"Be punctual and you will do fine. not a whole lot else to say, other than that i had a great time while i was there and im sad to see it go. Salutations"
good,WFB is going through many changes and the work environment is very unstable. Jobs are being eliminated on the sales side due to the fact that the company is focusing on retention.
good,"I've enjoyed my time at Wellsfargo.  It is a good company for people who enjoy helping the clients. I just personally have goals and felt because I'm a great performer I was not able to move and be promoted due to the supervisor wanted the performers to stay on his team, but there's no room to grow on that team."
good,lots of work with a lot of governance.  due to that can only really manage 3 - 4 major code releases per year.  very rigorous SDLC project lifecycles and lots and lots of documentation.
good,"Great transition from military to civilian life, good cohesion, pay could be better but in a sense fair, good tips into investing and savings , great training"
good,"Free lunches and drinks during our working hours would be nice. Offering voluntary days off, to be recognized for good work, daily and to really get employee's feed back to make it a better work environment."
good,"A typical work day consistent of pipeline management, and generating new business for home loans. I learned the different loan products we offered and guidelines that changed daily. My management was very supportive and instrumental in my success. We often had team building exercise especially around the holidays. The hardest thing about my job was breaking new to a client if a their loan was declined. The most enjoyable thing was sharing the experience and helping clients become first time home buyers."
good,Wells Fargo is an unique employer to work for. There are many opportunities and management team are eager and willing to help team members be placed in the correct department that best fits their talent.
good,"If you're trying to get into the banking or finance industry it's a great place to start. Job is really easy, you'll learn a lot as you go, but they do want you to learn everything quickly and if your to slow they will write you up for performance not up to standard and there is no opportunity for overtime, if you're hire for 25 hour teller they will not let you pass those 25 hours. If you go over they'll tell you to leave early  the next day or take a longer lunch."
good,"Low wages for a lot of work. "
good,Good place to work. Good room for advancements..management was always helpful. Sales was somewhat hard to met for tellers.  Would have liked to moved to CSR position.
good,Very disorganized chaotic environment. Very high turnover of employees. Poor hiring decisions made by management. Highly qualified candidates are overpromised by managers and end up disappointed and leave quickly.
good,"If I knew Arabic or Somali that would have been helpful. Customers/clients are very rude and impolite. To be honest it was a bit of a shock. That being said, of course there were a handful of decent people. I'm a likable person but I did not feel any kind of warm reception at this location. This is a very niche market, I'm sure other locations operate differently."
good,"My experience with Wells Fargo is always that they have a high-caliber, professional team. This was a short-term, remote, contract position. I was provided with quick, but thorough, training that helped me succeed in the role."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"It was a job, Nothing more nothing less it was a paycheck. Lots of referrals, that’s really all they care about. Sell sell and more selling, If you’re good at selling this job is good for you."
good,got hands on experience on selling and up selling to better assist customer needs. Was educated on different banking products and how they're used and when to pitch and how to pitch them.
good,team meeting which often run over the allotted time. tendency to make other people feel intimidated when they propose new ideas or ask for assistance.
good,Pay and management were considered above average. Although lofty production goals were required adequate support and assistance was given. Overall a good place to work as my department was not affected by some of the negative consumer finance issues in media.
good,"I do not have anything good or bad to say. This is a contract position. So far, I am doing well and I enjoy working at Wells Fargo. I enjoy working for my manager."
good,received a better opportunity with another financial institution.  Wells Fargo was a bit more focused on sales than customer experience.  Not too bad to work for
good,The stress that wells fargo place on their branch employees are extreme and often you as a person can be overlooked.............................................................
good,"I met some great people and some not so great managers, high pressure on sales and a lot of competition. Pay is good, the pressure was immense. Some of the managers werepresj"
good,"You need to have a clear strategy to lead teams. A lot of meetings, but you could manage it well, if you are prepared. I loved the fact that i was responsible to implement the roadmap that had a direct impact to the revenue growth target."
good,Overall decent place to work. The only problem I really had was when they started pressuring us to harass customers tio apply for credit cards they didn't want too apply for. I felt this hurt my credibility with them.
good,"Wells Fargo has great benefits to their employees and pay a great amount of them on your behalf. The only opportunity that I would say is that they don't have very many growth opportunities if you are in the Retail Banking division. They do not do cross training to allow you opportunity outside and into other divisions of Wells Fargo Bank. Their mentor program is garbage and when talked to about development programs, they insist on making sure management doesn't have these conversations often as they don't have opportunity for you to grow."
good,"Highly competitive, stressful, Low paying. They would hire any young kid coming off the street. It wasnt a good sign that I moved up to store ager withing a month"
good,"They strive to provide excellent customer service, great work place to work and a very professional office environment. Diversity and inclusion is totally a big part of the company."
good,"I was not there during the best period for Wells Fargo. My work experience was during the height of its ""issues."" I had a great team but what was asked and required of us became too much."
good,Yeah I’m gonna I wanna go get some lunch today to pick it you guys are going at home I can pick ya guys tomorrow and then I will was a way you can come and get it if ya guys can get them done with it I’ll pick ya guys I’ll be fine I just got to get my stuff ready and I will wanna go pick ya guys up
good,"Long hours on your feet, the front line tellers are not allowed to sit down at this location, I am diabetic and have permanent damage to the nerves in my feet from the short time I worked here. That was the only issue I had with this job 7 plus hours standing in the same place left me hating this job.  The managers sat in a back office and did not care how much anyone complained about it."
good,"It can be very busy depending on the date and time of the month. I learned and develop a lot when it comes to banking, which includes •	Providing excellent customer service."
good,Wells Fargo is my first opportunity after graduating college. I have learned a lot about working as a team as well as self-development. My main critique would be the lack of career advancement and recognition.
good,"Very relaxed, not much work. Poor work culture. Indian management is poor. Salary is very good. Lot of politics. Work culture in US is far better. Many of the teams in India are just for name sake."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Career advancement opportunities, always learning new things. I learned many work skills such as providing excellent customer service and meeting and exceeding sales goals."
good,Very clicky.  Management allows certain people to get away with stuff and not others.  They wont allow you to get to the median pay and will stop giving raises just because you are too close to the median.
good,"It was a decent place to work, with decent work accommodations. I wasn't there as an actual employee but as a contracted employee from a staffing agency on work to hire."
good,Working for this company helped me grow professionally. I was lucky enough to have such amazing leaders that helped me grow within the company and as a person. The down side to this company is that their personal goals and branch goals were high for some branches who did not have the traffic to meet those goals. If goals were not met disciplinary action was taken. I was very lucky to have such an amazing leader/ team that will help each other consistently.
good,Good office and entry level position. This position is ideal for individual who likes to sit for 8 hrs and can be on computer all day. Office culture and morale is low.
good,Management should have a little bit more experience in the field that they are supervising. Allow for more collaboration amongst employees to further development and job performance.
good,"rinse and repeat type of job.  if you are good at doing the same thing over and over, this might be for you. management only cares when you make mistakes.  if you do things correctly, no one notices."
good,The SeaTac branch was always short staffed and many times I was left working the teller side on my own with 40+ customers in line angry and yelling at me. I was not given proper training due to short staffing which then lead to me being let go. Despite working 40+ hours a week and no day off they didn't even care.  I was set up to fail and my manager did everything to fight it but uppers mismanagement  don't care for their employees not care for that branch.  Many times we requested help and they catered  to other benches
good,"Decent place to work aside form current direct management. Job is fast paced and ever changing, but enjoyable. Co-workers and staff are great. Good benefits. Workplace culture doesn't always align with real life. I was given the opportunity to get my licenses with lots of study time at work."
good,"Work family is great, however, high turnover rate due to the stressful and demanding nature of the job.  Great hours, flexible PTO, and great benefits."
good,Work load not balanced in the loss mitigation department. If you didn't meet the certain amount per hour they had at the time 10 reviews per hour. You were written up for performance.
good,"Very structured contact center, they are focused on the numbers! Customer care is their number one based off of previous reviews. Co-workers were great, management could be better."
good,Responsible for assisting customers calling into the bank to resolve issues and open new accounts. Obtained a very high sales goals/metrics with referring additional products & services. Advise customers on product options and financial solutions. I learned how to deal with tempered people. Management was reasonable. The culture at the work place was fun. Hardest part about the job in my opinion was the call volume. I enjoyed helping solve other peoples problem and the in office environment  .
good,"Mandatory Saturday's"
good,I had a good experience at Wells Fargo and would recommend it to anyone looking to learn about all the different lines of business within the typical large bank.
good,"I have worked in the public for over 35 years. This was by far the most stressful job I have ever done. But I did it and was proud that I did. Would do it again if I had to, but hope I never have to. Paid descent, but not for the stress. Got a lot of paid time off but could only take if they approve. Could never get approved for more than 2 days. You can take anyway but you take a point and can only get 6 points. Hard to get fired because they have a high turnover. Co-workers nice. Ethical issues."
good,Sometimes the people you work around can make your life and workspace  miserable. In my case this was it. I wish I would’ve transferred to a different wells. This is a nice place to be IF you have a decent branch manager and people around you.
good,"there are many departments at wf. if you start in a call center, you have very little mobility. start where youre with customers or numbers rather than starting in the call center."
good,"Working in a financial institution is by far the best learning experience. You learn so much for yourself as far as how things work and realize that over 90% of people aren't aware of how banking works period. It is self rewarding to teach others the knowledge you gain from your position. Environment is based on management. Whether you mind your own business or not, you will work under both types of management... good and bad. When they are great individuals, it's great! When they aren't great individuals, it's very bad. It's all politics and you have to be good at this if you intend to grow in this field. Most challenging part of this job could be the stress behind achieving sales goals; however, the most enjoyable is always the team you get to work with. Operations side is mostly about tracking every monetary interaction while achieving sales goals and handling cash transactions. Banker side is most flexible if you have emergencies, and it consists of you having a portfolio."
good,"Mortgage loan originator.  Job was full-time or more than full-time.  Working evenings, and weekends, and do not want to do that again.  Location was very close."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,compensation was decent however I did not like the back to back phone calls feels like you never got a break from the phone and the phone calls in the fraud department were long not a bad place to work but you have to find the right positon and department to work for . training could have been better you learn the most on the job floor out of the training room .
good,Upward mobility can easily be achieved for professionals interested advancing in their careers.  The El Monte campus offers many different positions in both customer and non customer facing roles.
good,"Innovative business professional with broad experience guiding client facing websites and internal team-based solutions, client relationships, systems transitions, and enterprise-wide transformations. Keen business intelligence to coordinate vendor products, project management, analyze user experience, and lead remote teams. Excellent communication, interpersonal, presentation, and listening skills to translate complex resources for non-technical audience and stakeholders. Passion for new technologies, systems, and solutions, including persona-based and device aware applications."
good,"I loved my job there for 3 years and then they started making changes. That change brought a new csr in and she hit me and my managers never would report her, so I left. She hit me bc I told her the lady in the drive they couldn’t hear me on the intercom bc she was being loud."
good,"No advancement opportunities and stressful work environment. however, benefits are excellent. Help is limited and prefer you to work independently. You feel invaluable."
good,It really depends on your management team. Some are very accommodating and believe in a life outside of work so they will try to work with you schedule. Others are not so flexible and don’t believe in allowing you any shift changes.
good,Average kind of work culture. management needs to focus in resource management in a better way. Worklife balance is good but its declining daya by day due to policy change
good,"I had several mixed feeling working for Wells Fargo on 2 different occasions, but like any position within a large bank, it really depends on the direct department you are in and the management within that department."
good,Respectable income potential as a home mortgage consultant but there were serious process issues while I worked there. A large portion of commission was tied to customer satisfaction surveys
good,"While I was at Wells Fargo, they did push for numbers often. Since leaving this has changed. Scripts were often used for every transaction, gets some taking used to."
good,"Stressful work environment with poor management direction and support.  Long demanding days with little to no recognition from management.  However, company benefits are outstanding."
good,"Wells can be a fun, challenging place, if presented with the right set of challenges/goal and more importantly, getting to work with the right people."
good,It was a nice place to train yourself into the banking world but the hours were bad. I started off part time and they expected me to stretch out 20 hours over 6 days. Then they moved me around to so many branches and  did not accommodate the fact that I worked a full time Job. I felt like for all the time I spent there I should have been made full time.
good,"It's an opportunity to learn about the banking and process.  There is opportunity to build relationships with partners and clients.  Advancement is there, but you may need to relocate."
good,"Normal banking environment. Normal working condition 8-5. Strict dress code."
good,"Was a productive work place, mostly friendly environment, my manager cared and took personal interest into his employees. All around decent work environment but just wasn't for me sitting behind a desk for 8 hours a day."
good,It was ok it was hard sales goals were rediculous girls would cry and pray every day to meet their daily goals. I was let go for not making my quarterly goals.
good,The fluidity of the organization is impeding innovation and progress.  There is a strong and talented team member base that has continued to contribute to the goals of the company.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Nobody really likes this job, my manager came off as very eroding. He didn’t even like his job as he said in many meetings. When making calls customers are already upset because of the way Wells Fargo is portrayed in the media. It’s answering calls everyday from customers that already have a preconceived notion about how the call will go. Constantly repeating yourself & procedures all day. Most stressful job I’ve ever worked. If you have anxiety/ low patience/ adhd this is NOT the ideal job for you."
good,"It's an okay company to work for. The benefits are good, but the compensation for the work needs tremendous work. I wish I had gotten paid more for what I did and how stressful it can get."
good,I enjoyed working at WF.  There is a lot of ongoing training and compliance that consumed alot of time.  The technology was superior to most companies I have worked for.
good,Nice place to work and great people.  I worked for Wells Fargo on and off for several years.  I was contacted to come back to WF in 2016 and was excited for the opportunity.
good,Mostly interacted w/ ERC management. Very little interaction w/ Wells Fargo. They would come to the office and mainly interact w/ our onsite managers.
good,Great company for women to work for. Good wwork life balance. Great initiative for employees. Great management. Alot of opportunity to learn new things.
good,"Wells Fargo was my first experience within the banking industry and I did learn a lot from them. It is a very fast-paced environment, so expect to be busy from beginning to end. The hardest part of the job is learning and keeping up with the regulations. During the few years I was here the sales expectations were extremely high. Overall Wells Fargo was okay, the pay and benefits were good. I left because I the time my management team only saw sales numbers vs experience/skills and unfortunately I was not a pushy sales person."
good,"I was a remote contractor, very good environment and tools for accomplishing my job. Enjoyed the people and position Team accomplished a lot in less time than expected."
good,Job was extremely demanding and stressful. Overtime was mandatory everyday. Management even wanted us to work on our off days. All Management cared about was their numbers. Little to no recignition. Pay was not great good benefits though.
good,"Was in wellsfargo when the culture was to get as much profit as possible.  As a customer service rep, we were left with very little info and too much to worry about.  every single second was counted in there."
good,there is a lot of diversity a lot of activities and always something to work on. good experience good people. work oriented. regular workflow. business casual wear.
good,"Site in Charlotte offers a lot of amenities.  Difficult to park close based on size of location.  Once your inside, everything you need is there.  Good facility."
good,"Wells Fargo is a good company to work for overall. "
good,"Wells Fargo tries very hard to be a reputable company but through gaps in management and oversight, I'm still embarrassed to tell people where I work."
good,Very Competitive. Awesome work hours. Leadership was great. Good Pay. Great Work Hours. Always room for Advancement. Recognizes real hard work.Great Location
good,Because I was a Contractor at Wells Fargo I didn't receive any of the company benefits and was not privied to knowing what they were.  You can only work at Wells Fargo for 2 years as a Contractor and they have to let you go if they don't hire you and I've seen them let people go even if there good workers and have good attendance.
good,Big company with 100% chance for job security but at what cause? Employees tend to feel like they are not recognize by the system in place. But very good place to start in world of business
good,Well Fargo is a company that provides great benefits and pretty good pay. The working environment is depressing and the management will micromanage till you leave.
good,Good job but it could get stressful. You will learn as you go. The training was great but you will learn from experience. You have to be open to learning new things.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I learned about Corporate Trust Services and Lease Agreements from the Bank. Sadly, this division is ending its services in Salt Lake City and transferring to Minnesota."
good,After the company had cutbacks a lot of employees were laid off. Very fast paced work environment with monthly and quarterly goals that need to be met
good,"Slow and people were laid off often. People were constantly switched to different departments often. The people were great, the environment was nice. The work load was minimal."
good,"Decent enough. Big corportate culture, management is nice super difficult to move up cent enough. complete decent that would be the best way to describe it."
good,Overall it was a good experience but not too many opportunities to advance during the time I was employed. If there were more opportunities I would I continued my employment with the company.
good,I found it to be an OK place to work.  Advancement opportunities were limited for me.  Other may have more success there than I did.  i really enjoyed their diversity program.
good,"It was embarrassing to work for such an unethical company."
good,I originally joined because I felt the culture was my culture. Back then it started that way until JUMP IN JANUARY.. Any original WF employee would know what that means. Things changed and I knew I could not continue.
good,Wells Fargo has opened up a lot of oppotunities for me when I first put myself into the job market. Many different teams and each team has their own management style
good,Great place to obtain work experience.  Productive and business orientated. A typical day at work is that people or normally focus. I learn how to become a successful manager.
good,Great company to work for. Room for growth if you are patient and are willing to put in the work. A lot of bureaucracy in the company. Co workers are awesome.
good,The job has great benefits but it is a very competitive setting. Management could use a little more improvement but this is a safe environment to work.
good,"As long as your sales are superior you can be promoted, but the sales pressure and encouraging of non ethical behavior was a lot of stress. Test's morals."
good,"I like Wells Fargo, but to be honest I am disappointment... recently I earn a Lead Teller position and what a big disappointment when they told my pay will be just a few cents more of what my pay used to be... Wells Fargo doesn't pay fairly. I have so much responsibilities and the branch is so busy, sometimes I feel they giving me charity instead of paying for my job... right now looking for another job."
good,"Handle inbound calls with the intent of providing customer satisfaction retention, while assessing financial needs for products and services and work with underwriting to ensure proper customer resolution"
good,Competitive salary and benefits for Charlotte. Management style and culture could be improved. Stop moving teams to Ballantyne - I would've stayed if the accounting/finance groups were in uptown Charlotte.
good,"Been working for Wells Fargo for a year, during my time there all employees got a raise for our performance. When time up up for another pay raise, i was the only teller that was discriminated and didn't receive a pay raise without a reasonable explanation. Management showed favortism with tellers and helped certain ones. After contacting a higher level of management, things go worse. Worse job ever!"
good,Wells Fargo was a good beginning job in the banking industry. Taught me great cash handling skills and how to deal with many different types of people.
good,"Processed standard teller transactions for customers including servicing accounts, accepting loan and credit card payments, cashing checks, accepting deposits"
good,make sure to be on time and get your work done and bring a smile for excellent customer service.  very friendly co-workers and great work-life balance.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Good company and work place for the beginners to start with their career, learning the project and technical communication with various geographical locations"
good,"Team oriented environment, but lacked competent training.  Trainer seemed too busy and rarely available for help.  Was regularly told to call phone number to get assistance."
good,I loved working at Wells Fargo and would love to go back to Wells Fargo for employment.  The benefits were fantastic and I am extremely comfortable working in the banking industry
good,Overall friendly place to work and great way to start a career. Would recommend to anyone leaving college to begin at wells fargo. Plenty of room for advancement throughout.
good,I was going through a difficult time and Wells Fargo was not capable to relocate me. After being their friend employee for more than a year. But beside that I enjoyed my role for them.
good,I've had been included in two layoffs within the company. They do help with either finding you a new position within and outside job placement. The pay is decent.
good,"Culture showed favortism , sometimes misogynistic.  Did not handle employee feed back well.   Hard to guage where you stood for job opportunity growth."
good,"• Construct fraud cases for investigators to review and solve claims."
good,"At first the company was really great to work for, but the job security was always at question.  I did enjoy my job there and was sad that I had to leave.  The best part of this job was the clientele."
good,"Good place to work. Was hard to understand job even after training. Was a nice place to work! Had good management, and nice environment. Would like to work their again."
good,"Its ok, not too bad just depends on which manager you get. Also its tough being a contractor. No development for contractors, which is probably to be expected."
good,"Especially living in SF, the pay wasn't great and the work was just data entry. The people individually were nice but they talked about each other all the time."
good,"A typical day at work consists of taking calls from Financial advisors, guiding them on best options for their clients. Taking the time to explain the programs, Mutual funds, Etf's, stocks, bonds. Extremely quite at the workplace with occasional conversations outside of work. The Most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers."
good,"The district where I was a personal banker was phenomenal. I hated it at the time but my manager was such a teacher and was big on banker integrity. Call nights, and constantly having to carry around an account kit off the clock made work/life balance impossible, but I think again that all depends on the district you’re in."
good,"Not the best Branch Manager, so that made it a little difficult. The teller manager was the best part of the job and got along with everyone. But in the end I realized that working at a bank wasn't for me."
good,Very large company where at times too much administrative work and can take a long time to get things done.  If you can get through these challenges can be a rewarding place to work.
good,"Wells Fargo was okay.  The benefits and pay weren't bad.  I had  horrible manager with anger issues the first time and that wasn't fun."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The workplace culture prior to Wells Fargo's scandals was quite toxic. It was not a positive place to work as the values being expressed were not reinforced through the job.
good,"For the most part, I had excellent managers.  They tried to keep atmosphere fun and competitive.  The interaction with the customer was always the most important thing.  You should have impressed the customer with your service and when they needed something you didn't handle, you got them to the right people."
good,"5 years, worked with some great people but has turned into a non-employee and customer centric workplace. Significant leadership changes at all levels."
good,"The first year is great because they give you a guarantee.  After that, they want to cap you once you move up in the company.  There's a lot of freedom when working here."
good,"Not much to say about Wells, they dont pay as well as other banks. Not too much pressure to sell since that scandal a few years back, Look for other jobs"
good,"I will say that the pay at Wells Fargo and the benefits were excellent and advancement opportunities abound, but where they fall down is in management and taking care of their employees when it isn't a matter of profit. I was fired from Wells Fargo for attendance during a very trying month in which my spouse (Who had also recently been fired by Wells for attendance due to her health) was hospitalized and I had to find childcare for my then-four year old while i was working and had no one available to do so, and to make matters worse they fired me days before christmas."
good,"Not a good job, huge disconnect between management and branch staff. Pay was ok but If branch didn’t sale enough products had to stay late after work to bother customers."
good,"The company has one set of standards, while the loacal management has their own separate goals that far exceed the companies expectations, so while you may be a stellar employee in the companies eyes and metric system, you are made to feel that you are underachieving by the loacal management team."
good,"A typical day would be helping the customer with transactions, performing control tasks for auditing purposes, referring customers to platform side. Working with the public is the best part/ hardest part of the job. Not to mention, the constant state of alert due to fraud attempts by non-customers and customers alike. There is not as much pressure to perform as in the past, but the lack of sales demand has also come with a lack of sales incentive--very minimal bonus opportunity."
good,"In working at WF for over 4 years, the benefit are fantastic, but unless you are in a an urban area your room for advancement is very limited.  They are also closing many small branches within their footprint."
good,The company is very numbers and metric driven. Peak days can be stressful.  They provide lots or training.  There are many programs to network and build lots of professional and personal relationships.
good,Manager did not know anything about the job and there was a lot of drama.  The Head manager was great and did everything possible to help you.  A few of the employees made unnecessary drama.
good,"Banking is a different type of accounting, in general. The location was easy to access and this was an area of banking of which I was unfamiliar providing a new learning curve and experience that is rare."
good,Wells fargo was a part-time opportunity meanwhile I finished school. I would say that the experience ranges based on the management you work with. Career opportunities are given if you are into this kind of field.
good,"I have received a lot of growth in this company and like the overall culture. Had a great time working with the previous manager, however with the change in management style which was very micro and also there was no team activites or no interaction of the senior management with the team."
good,had to leave during the scam that started in 2016 as my job was not secured and a lot of wells fargo employees who had nothing to do with the incident had to with it in addition to that Wells was so sales oriented and didnt follow sales integrity at all times
good,"I was an Account Executive managing a $6M book of business. Servicing accounts. Claims management. "
good,The company is not about the customers. The employees were not trained right as well to know the knowledge they needed to know.  Also we had to get at-least 20 over to the plat form a week.
good,No review for wells fargo. I do not wish to speak on a company that i worked for. Whether it is good or bad. I wish to not say anything at all about a company that i was a part of.
good,"Although the company is good and stable, they need to give more incentives to their employees. They are very set on pushing numbers for their employees,rather than the real focus of customer satisfaction."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Management is the issue at the company level its not.team oriented everyone out for them selves.  Makes it hard to do your job and focus on the customers needs.
good,.I am in a training program.  Therefore it’s hard to speak about the actual office environment and culture.  From what I am currently able to tell is very professional and employees are treated fairly.
good,Wells Fargo Advisors is a fine organization to work for.  Unfortunately it has a stained reputation by bad banking practices and the company is also a bit behind the curve with software technologies.
good,I enjoyed my position with Wells Fargo. I am glad they have taken away the sales culture and made it about the customer. Not may places up to go though.
good,"I was contracted from the company Diversant to perform QA Testing and Automation Engineering on the Wells Fargo Banking application Greenhouse."
good,Good place to work great comrades with employees. Always something new to learn and very paced.  Must always come in with a positive attitude. A lot of overtime
good,They provide you with 16 paid hours to volunteer per year. The only problem is trying to schedule that when it's convenient for your team. I wanted to go with my co-worker but we were not allowed to both be gone on the same day.
good,"we did not have fun workplace area it was a large warehouse and we update computers, unloaded trucks,processed new customers and added new apps, to computers."
good,Good starting job for people who are looking to start in the finance industry. No real analytics but it was a great stepping point and was a great way to see how corporate life works.
good,"Healthcare ""benefits"" changed. Please dont opt for their expensive health care. Not worth it just for that. They used to offer a health savings account that paid for a significant amount of health care costs. Now they seem to be cutting corners.  Great job stability however just dont enroll in health care."
good,The training is good it could be better with some adjustments. The people are friendly and nice . Quality team is great they make sure you are doing your job well.
good,"Pay is not based on AUM which provides those new to the industry the ability to learn without uncertainty around paychecks. Very boring though, no focus on development beyond current job duties."
good,"During a typical work week, one of my biggest tasks is checking in on my staff and assessing progress on various projects. I like to meet first thing on Mondays to discuss our priorities for the week, then meet again in the middle of the week to check progress, and once at the end of the week to discuss goal setting for the next week."
good,"Being a teller has a lot more to do with cashing checks. It's very helpful to be persuasive, well educated on your products as you will be ""selling"" them to your customers."
good,Wells Fargo is a very goal oriented and fast paste work environment. The company have very high standards in terms of expectations for performances and being well verse in product knowledge and policies and procedures.
good,"Great work environment. I totally enjoyed the job but some of the management are bias and discriminating . They had ordered my permanent name plack even and my stats were on target all the time I worked there for them, My team leader NEVER met with me for a one on one, even when I ask. He would just say was too busy . There was no working with me to be a better employee. No clue I would be released."
good,"The typical day at my position is cut and dry. You review documents and put labels on them. It can be a bit boring at times, but so long as you have headphones and something to listen to, you tend to do all right. Everything you need to know for it tends to be taught on the job, which is pretty nice."
good,"Lowest pay in cyber industry. Never hires contractors. No raises. But it is a job and sometimes u can work from home but it's a pain because not all apps work from home. "
good,"Wells Fargo is a typical workplace.  However, a quick turnover of officers affects low-rank employees' career resulting on a non-clear career path.  President and Assistant President do not have a clear view of what District Managers are doing and how subordinates are treated."
good,Job duties and role were acceptable. Lack of internal advancement unless you knew someone. Paid well for position. Stressful. Never good enough even with incredible audit and team scores.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Great team environment, well-organized and structured. Clear on what needed to be done by when most of the time, support to get it done. Distributed work done right. Enjoyed my colleagues."
good,30 years of service and decided to retire. I guess it was ok. I survived the number of acquisitions which occurred over the years and retired on a good note.
good,Wells Fargo is great for customer but not for teammates  the pay is not great for the amount of work and the location is not the best place to be working
good,i do not have anything to say this place was great until they sold our department and gave little info prior to the shcedule close on the deal. we were very upset.
good,"I worked for WF for 3 years, def a burnout job but WF did support you with OT and working weekends with benefits. Management was sporadic in regards to experience. I feel some moved up based on liking and politics involved. If you are looking for change in careers this would be a good start."
good,Very professional environment.  I installed Cisco phones and this was done after hours so I had little contact with anyone working at Wells Fargo.  I hope that is helpful.
good,"The position involves dealing with credit and debit card fraud, and it's definitely a typical phone center position. Customers don't really understand what is going on a lot of time, and that results in a lot of yelling."
good,"I would call people on the phone and demand money from them at a time in their lives when they were at their lowest, and it slowly ate away at my soul."
good,"The people I worked with were great, however the company itself had a lot of flaws. It was not interested in my personal development or growth more so in it's bottom line."
good,Good company excellent starter job after college started in call center area lots of room for growth throughout the company entry level positions lead some to great careers
good,"If you like being on the phone and having the stress of phone call goals, then this is your cup of tea. If you don't like that feeling, don't take this job. The pay is good but there is a reason for that."
good,"I had managers that focused on development, and helped me further my banking skills. I also had managers that were not focused on building their teams skills."
good,Good place for someone to start their career. There is a lot of calls and training and sometimes it is hard to do your job. there is a lot of pressure to meet sales goals.
good,"Busy work"
good,"Management was numbers driven, a lot of cross selling and aggressive upgrading or if you could not make your numbers corrective action was well enforced."
good,"Too much redtape, upper management is quite clueless in general about the direction the bank is heading towards. It's better to work for a tech company than for a bank if you are in Tech field, in general."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"im not giving a review on a company i no longer work for, it paid the bills and i have nothing bad to say about them so here is 150 minimum characters"
good,I really enjoyed my time there! My supervisors and colleagues were great and I learned a lot about bank products and cash handling procedures. The overall workload was fine however the pressure put on employees to achieve sales goals were very stressful and often promoted shady doings.
good,"Wells fargo isn't a horrible place to work, but when I worked there they micromanaged alot and you needed to reach your numbers everyday. I personally would not recommend."
good,Company is going through a lot of changes.  Look forward to changes for the better.  Some areas are better than others.  There are a lot of compliance work.
good,"I was a Consumer Lending Summer Intern for about 10 weeks. I was able to travel (all expenses paid) for a week for a summit to meet other interns from across the country. Most of the day to day of the internship was up to me or my on-site manager, with some assignments given from the off-site intern program manager. I spent a large amount of time on my own going through required trainings which consist of reading and answering questions at my desk. The location I was at was a bit empty on some days. The hardest part of the job was presenting the idea for the end of internship project. They had an on-site cafeteria and gym and many meeting rooms if you needed one. The location I was at had no entry level positions for me to apply to after my internship and I was rejected for any other entry level job with the company many months after applying. I had an excellent employee review and good recommendations. My advice is to connect with many higher-ups and be aggressive with following up on applications."
good,Wells Fargo was an ok place to work.  The culture was satisfactory.  Working conditions were above average.  There was plenty of training and advancement opportunities.
good,A fast paced working environment with opportunities to learn about community banking rules and regulations and policies and procedures along with customer service skills
good,WF has not been my favorite place to work.  It was a very stressful job.  We switched project frequently which lead to customer dissatisfaction because they never talked to the same rep.
good,"Wells Fargo is a very successful company and it pays great, and There are many different positions available for hire. I met a lot of really great people working here."
good,"MY co workers were great. Everybody was always positive and happy to work.If i had problems with anything my boss was always eager to help. the job was very easy to learn. We also read from a script which was easy to follow and remember must calls were the same so, my call volume was always quick and my customer service was fast, accurate , and professional"
good,A typical day at work felt long as there were no time for breaks.  I learned a lot because our job title changed constantly.  It was hard to move up if you did not know someone who would recommend you to the position.
good,"Performed daily tasks such as balance, deposits, withdraws, wire transfers and cross sales. The schedule was accommodating and large break room was appreciated."
good,Wells Fargo was once the strongest bank in the country.  It was also a great place to work...especially during the financial crisis.  It is not a fun place to work with the lack of job security and current reduction in force!
good,"lacking in management and technology specialists.  Needs to spend more time making sure the ""boots on the ground"" have what they need to be effective."
good,Good for short term work but not for long journey. Learned shell scripting and standby techniques. People around was really good but management is worst.
good,"Great  company, but has been going through nonstop changes, so it makes one very insecure to work there during this period. The corporate culture is very collaborative...group consensus...respectful team members."
good,"Undetermined, I was a contractor and not a full time employee."
good,Management is not always on the same foot. This job got me through college and pushed me towards a new career with another bank. I do not think this should be a lifelong career.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The work environment was busy.  It was very hard to focus.  I used various options to tune out the noise to get my work done.  Even walking around didnt allow much clearing my head of the work that needed to be done.
good,"The day is full.  Plenty to do.  You are expected to make work you life.  There is no consideration for family.  "
good,"Overworked all their employees. Unsound business practices, management was aware but turned a blind eye. Compensation and benefits were decent, but that can only buy your loyalty for so long. Disappointed in the company overall. Left before their current rebranding and restructuring."
good,"easy to get in, but difficult to move up unless you have been there forever. seniority is more important than results. loved the people i worked with for the most part but it was difficult to build a culture due to the high turnover"
good,"My coworkers at Wells Fargo are extremely competent, capable workers.  There are many impediments to efficiency and effectiveness but I can't say enough good things about the employees in general."
good,It was a great place to work. It was a shame that the location closed as quickly as it did. There was tons of training and support. Overtime was optional yet available. I met alot of great people
good,Simple job with good pay. I didn't like working there as the customers were frequently rude. My coworkers were great and so was my boss. I'm not fond of Wells Fargo as a company but as an entry-level position being a teller is a good move for any college student.
good,You have the opportunity to grow. The company is going in the right direction. I have many family and friends that still work at this company. They plan to retire.
good,"Was difficult at times, Good team to work with.  Completing tasks, management wasn't bad, good team,hardest part many difficult levels, best was helping people."
good,Wells Fargo has always been a very good bank to work for.  The San Diego region has experienced considerable changes over the past 5-7 years that have made the organization more corporate.
good,"No one was committed to making a decision and when a decision was made, they were not communicated within the group so they were repeatedly changed in the next meeting."
good,Very nice people to work with. Processor's worked in same office as the loan officers. Staff had their own office. Relaxed atmosphere. Supportive management.
good,"Continous meeting on a daily basis, and non productive no work balance"
good,"My experience at Wells was marked by constant management changes which caused losses in scope and focus on a project. "
good,With Wellfargo being in the news for negative press they are trying hard to save their image. This is putting stress on their employees new and old to save customer opinion.
good,People that you work with are awesome. Call center environment is fun and easy. Work is meaningful and impactful. Leaders of the company allow for the opinion of middle management to be heard.
good,"I dedicated my life to WF for 25 years right out of college, advancing within the company to Management role with no issues or complaints on my record and then one day new management comes in and I'm let go without Human Resources assisting me or listening to what happened."
good,Promoting was based off connections and who you know. They want people that will not contradict their management styles or question their decisions or training.
good,The atmosphere there wasn't what I expected. The reps were very rude to the customers and the customers were very nasty and vulgar to the reps. I was looking for something more organized.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Had an amazing experience working within the home mortgage department. I worked alongside a great team and under a great manager. But being punctual and present are a must!
good,"I'm still employed by wells fargo, and enjoy what I am currently doing. however I wam looking or a second job to help reduce my bills. I would recommend working here"
good,"I was happy to be a team member there.  WF took care of their employees.  When we were laid off due to the sun setting of the product we offered, Wells Fargo gave us a great severance package"
good,As a contractor the work environment was ok. A lot of meetings and not enough training. Would have been nice to have more training because of the pass pace environment.
good,"Learning expierence, good place to work, lots of training would return in a different role! I really liked my managerS and the customers... growth opportunities"
good,"I loved building a team and different individuals coming together to accomplish one goal. I learned a lot about managing the process and leading people. Unfortunately, I was under the wrong impression my district manager had her manager's best interest first. That was a huge let down in the end of my employement."
good,"They set goals that are impossible to hit."
good,"Wells Fargo would be a great place to work if you were paid more for what you do. I am paid $1,130 every other week for helping customers achieve financial success and share advice to all customer types including customers with $500,000-$3,000,000 in assets. Shouldn't someone helping customers especially those with high balances be paid more than $2,000 per month to live on? I do. Also pressure you to get customers to come back for financial reviews and lead down a path towards a product. Maybe if you got paid more it would be easy to convince your self to give the customer a push just like the old days."
good,I was at Wells Fargo during the rebuilding phase after the scandals with the sales. So the training process was tweaked I assume to make employees feel like the scandal was in the past.
good,"I worked at Wells Fargo as a customer service representative, accepted calls regarding account information and account maintenance.  Upselling products at the end of each call."
good,The Job was poorly managed. creating animosity between all employees. not a fun environment. the pay was sub-par for the work you had to do. they did not care about your opinions.
good,"This dept is just ok. The pay is alright for someone who is just starting out, but there are no incentives of any sort for the work that you do while other depts in the same building get quarterly bonuses. The metrics are the same so this is confusing."
good,I was excited to become a Wells Fargo Team Member because of the culture of caring and the company’s vision and values. During my first 18 months with the company I excelled and was prepared to embark on new endeavors. Upon transferring to my current role I was placed under management that did not operate according to the Wells Fargo standard and my love for my work began to decline. Job security was no longer a staple and human error became a point of shame. While I love the company I’m extremely disappointed in the disconnect within this department.
good,"great location, and the work environment is alright to work. also the them members are great to work with. some of the managers are will to help you move forward in your career."
good,"environment is stressful, however the learning process is huge due the size of the company and the amount of employees. Good company to start with in the financial field"
good,"I was a temp.  Not invited to meetings, lunches, etc.  I felt invisible.  No vacation days, management was there for 30 years plus.  Had 0 empathy for someone trying to find a full time job."
good,"Stressful environment with lack of corporate assistance in policy adjustments. The people present at the branch I was associated with caused a lot of problems, employee and customer."
good,I dont really want to write this. I guess wells is a good place with decent pay. Its a lot of mentally stressful work. Management expects the little guy to run the place while they point a finger and tell you what to do.
good,Given opportunities to increase skills but advancements were few and far between. Yearly pay increases were very small but bonuses were adequate. The bad press took a toll on employ moral.
good,"There are a lot of great things about WF, but honestly it's all about your team & manager. The biggest challenge I've found is getting a proper pay hike once you're in a group. The 2% raises don't keep up with the cost of living increase."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"They were an ok company to work for. There are some improvements that can be made. I was not able to advance the way that I would have like to. I would work there again, in another role."
good,My job was slow paces. I enjoyed working with Wells Fargo Security but the pay rte was low. I worked at for two years. I've always enjoyed doing security guard.
good,"I worked at Wells Fargo Advisors for 7 years and as can be expected some situations were with the advisors you support were difficult to navigate..."
good,"Payment is always correct and on schedule. Employees are nice and willing to assist in any way. Work is interesting, but very structured.  Thank You! Hope this helps!"
good,"I have always enjoyed working in the financial industry, specifically in banking because there as so many opportunities to learn and grow. There are so many different paths you can go take. The benefits are great as well, along with the perks. The biggest discouragement in banking for me personally is management. In order for you to grow you have to have great management and you don't always end up in a branch that has great management that helps develop or polish your skills to move up and get promoted."
good,A good company to work for but all too often temps are only worked through their contract then let go.   Location was great and had a great food area for lunch.
good,I was trained and worked as a Personal Banker that I unfortunately didn't enjoy. Management was respectful and worked with me to find a position that was right for me at the time.
good,It was a great location to work at. The culture was different at the time that I worked there. I enjoyed the people and the facility most. Management didn't care too much about helping everyone succeed.
good,"Once I had established a good relationship with the personal bankers, they came to trust me with their clients and that took us to new levels.  This worked out for all 3 sides, the client, the personal bankers, and obviously myself.  Since I left Wells Fargo, I still have a great relationship with several of the employees there, even ones that weren't working there when I was.  I have done mortgages for a couple of them, and they've also been very comfortable coming to me with questions about possible mortgage options for them and they're family, who they also have referred to me."
good,"Wells Fargo pays a reasonable rate, but the environment and hours were not for me. It is hard to maintain a work-life balance since the hours are often 8:30-6pm and Saturdays are required for the most part."
good,"Large call center environment,  lots of information to learn and apply to your job. Many experienced co workers to learn from. I am happy to have gained this work experience."
good,"Average company to work for. Medical benefits are pricey. It is fairly easy to move up within the company. The pay is good, depending on what you are doing."
good,"overall, "
good,"This is a good company to work for, flexible, a lot of training and career advancement opportunities. A lot of work life balance and care for employees."
good,"Very much a retail sales environment.  No longer have ""sales goals"" but the mindset tends to be such.  Not a lot of advancement.  The advancement that there is comes with sales goals and alot of stress."
good,"The culture is currently changing into one where you're somewhat afraid you won't have a job the next day. More processes are being automated which is great, and I support the direction and customer focus the company is driving towards. Development opportunities are great, but it's difficult to move up in the company. Job postings are very competitive, and it's more about who you know, having a good recommendation to get the job than your qualifications."
good,If you have limitations that prevent you from being on your feet this would be the perfect job. Hours are typical 8-5 mon thru Friday. Great benefits and paid time off
good,Salary was basically the only good thing about working for this company.  You are always referred to as your employee number and not your name.  Production was the number one concern
good,A typical day of work included training for a specific project in accordance with laws and regulations regarding the mortgage process. It included interacting with several different people and positions.
good,"Good Bank, Bad timing. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,zero work life balance-goals make in impossible to enjoy work.  have a bad rep for only caring about production-fire employees at will no support system
good,stress free environment..    easy to work with others and mangers are always there to help out when needed. I loved the company outings that we had. I would recommend this company to anyone
good,"I started working with SouthTrust in 2002, went through 2 mergers. First becoming Wachovia then Well Fargo. Each company was different, but all they were all good companies."
good,Good Job. Great opportunity to have. Very well organized company with seldom changes. Thos is a good company to work for. You will find alot of advancement opportunity with them.
good,"Worked there years ago, taught me banking & got me into mortgages. Was not bad job for going to college & working. Good stepping stone. Competive quarterly"
good,Good internship learned a lot. Limited hours and role were chalkenging. I wish they ya doeovided more opportunity for hands on work and serious work. Otherwise very informative
good,"Wells Fargo has been my place of employment for twenty one years.  It is an ok place to work, depending on the department and team you work on.  Wells Fargo"
good,High Stress but the people were nice. Work was a clean and breaks were nice.  The only challenge was dealing with angry customers and slow title companies.
good,Good Work Environment. Management was good. I learned how to be a professional at this job. Culture was professional and structured. Perfect environment for new young professionals.
good,"I cannot rate for a company I do not work for. Giving a review for Wells Fargo is not applicable to me. However, if I need to go in for banking needs, they seem pretty friendly."
good,This was once a great place to work before the computer center buyout. Afterwords people had no meaning to them as they closed one division after another. People were let go in small groups of 20 to 30 so it didn't make the news. Some were able to acquire jobs within the new company but most were just out of a job.
good,"Great place to work if you are fortunate to get the right manager.  Some mid-level managers are not the best and the team suffers unnecessarily.  Not a lot of communication the top department leads down.  The CEO and other SENIOR Leaders are good about town halls, etc."
good,"no comment  i wish not to comment.  But working with the people there was awesome.  Great employees, that give their all. I miss the people.  The customers where great people as well"
good,The management could be better but no one has financial degrees. Only the Financial advisor does. Everyone else is just a retail employee. Great place to make money.
good,"Monotonous work, "
good,"Management is struggling with structure at this time and not considering the fate of its employees.  Subsequent to recruiting and hiring of employees internally and from other companies, the management has changed directions to the detriment of its people.  The obvious strategy has recently been to take cost cutting measures and staff reduction to improve the ""bottom line"" after paying significant fines for fraudulent actions of a few employees and mismanagement of the same.  This includes the sale of branches and elimination of some programs only recently commenced in the past few years."
good,"I began working at Wachovia Bank in 1995, that was great company excellent benefits! Since Wells Fargo took over the only thing I like is the grandfathered PTO. The job is very stressful production driven and lots of over-time. You are so tired when you get a day off you usually sleep. The pay is decent, but very hard to move out of my dept. I have applied for about six different jobs and been turned down for almost all of them. How can you work somewhere 23 years and not be able to advance. I have achieved 3 Gold Coin Awards! I was top performer in 2015! Not a good company for advancement."
good,Wells Fargo has potential to be a great financial institution and place to work if the higher management would stop being greedy and think of the employees and customers more that the bottom line.
good,"- Wait on customers & do their banking transactions. All vault duties, assist with tellers and  coaching."
good,I really enjoyed working with the Telecom group at WFDS and wish I was still with Dealer Services.I processed telecom invoices and truly enjoyed my work.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Your work day was pretty typical for as an underwriter/qa you know what is on your plate at all times.  The expectations were always understood and management was supportive to help improve and meet your career goals and aspirations.  Keep a good work balance and time management is important in the role as well.  They allowed you to control your day as an independent contributor.  The best part of the job was knowing my day to day expectations and seeing the growth for the future.
good,I enjoyed working from home. It allowed me to have work life balance and to have flexibility when needed. I was able to start work at 6am and free up my afternoons.
good,Was bombarded with files from the first to the last day I was there. Just when I would get caught up with my pipeline someone would leave or get promoted and I would inherit their files which would only put me back in the hole I had just worked my way out of. Overwhelming to say the least.
good,There’s not really that much I could say about working with wells. This is a company you could definitely grow in if your are in the right department and set the career goals to move up.
good,"While I certainly learned a lot, I was never able to advance during the six years spent with the company.  Many lateral moves and no opportunity to move up."
good,"Typical work day was pretty face paced"
good,I enjoyed my time their. It was my first job right out of school. I learned a lot from management and other staff members. overall it was a great experience.
good,I was a bank manager for over five years before coming to Wells Fargo and left after six months. Sales pressure was unethical and intense. I would recommend any job in the back office or training area but not the retail side of banking.
good,I feel that there is a lack of moral and employee are not treated fairly. More should be done as far as taking care of the employees that work there and maybe moral would be better.
good,The first 5 or 6 years was great. Very aggressive goals. Many laws changed during the economic crash and it became a very high stress environment. Pay was good but bonus was cut and company demanded very high aggressive goals met.
good,Wells Fargo had its good things and bad things. This is an intense environment and I would not return to employment there. I feel this company is more suited for younger or high energy employees
good,Working in banking (SunTrust/Wachovia) allowed me to grow professionally. My customer service interaction were strengthen through the products and services we offered.
good,A great early opportunity to build my banking career when corporate banking was one of the main engines of growth.  I learned a lot and have carried those lessons with me going forward.
good,The time I work at wells Fargo it is temporary job and they could do whatever they want with you..as I said they don't care about you..they could laid you off whenever they want to and call you back if you get luck..so it is not sure.
good,"Job was mostly customer service, and so a typical day could be filled with a lot of complaints.  Sometimes it was satisfying to be able to  help people."
good,Bank Teller dealing with cash and customers. Had to balance draw every day after bank closed.  I was not comfortable in this role and I resigned after working for 1 year.
good,Well Fargo created opportunities to travel to destinations that I would not have otherwise been able to do. I was awarded a top honor which brought me to San Diego CA. I was also able to apply my technical skills on a daily basis not allowing my skills to grow stagnant.
good,"The management was very inconsistent, and treated employees poorly. Benefits were good but they are not a very family oriented company. Policy was very strict in comparison to other employers"
good,"Company definitely believes in promoting from within, but often does not take the time to train those they promote. Poor decisions on who they promote to management, for lack of better training. Being great in one's position does not dictate one will be an excellent manager."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"there is little i can recall about this job. the day to day was processing loan mortgages and follow up on status of loan closings."
good,"Did this while in school and it helped pay the bills i had at that time - as a student...plus buy the occasional lunch on campus. Not much else to say otherwise, it was not a forever job."
good,"i  only worked there 8 months and there was a lot of negativity "
good,I left before the switch in sales tactics so what I have to say might not be relevant anymore. I wonder what Upper Level Management now considers worthy or their attention.
good,Interesting place to work. Very cautious about information security. Company was training oriented.  Deadlines and end of month times could be very stressful.
good,"Not my favorite company to work for however, my managers were amazing."
good,"very diverse, room for growth, work/life balance, wonderful  management, ability to learn new job functions and how they play a role in the overall company."
good,Not a bad place to work. Management was open to communication. Tried to accommodate everyone with work schedule. The metrics we had to meet kept changing that’s one of the things I didn’t like
good,This job allowed a decent amount of time flexibility. The competitive workspace became toxic at times. You will also occasionally be sent to other bank locations to work as well.
good,The coworkers were fun to be around even though the position was stressful we always found ways to destress. I was apart of the fun committee and we always have monthly activities to destress.
good,"Fun place to work, management wasn't the greatest. Close to food. Work was fun and challenging. FT employees were supportive and helpful to contractors."
good,"ok what else i can say.  My manager is very nice, father of 7 girls."
good,Worked on mortgages and documentation. Daily worked with team on filing and copying the necessary documents for a specify client. This was temporary job and the team I worked with was good.
good,"Wells Fargo is great for entry level work. great benefits, tuition reimbursement, PTO, paid volunteer time, and maternity/paternity leave of absence.  decent pay"
good,"Its been a while since I worked there so i'm sure things have changed a bit.  It was a fun job for the time frame, had a lot of wonderful people that I worked with"
good,"From my experience at Wells Fargo in the IT department, I found the work-life balance excellent while the career and skills development growth very slow."
good,Great for stepping into industry and gaining exposure on your field of specialization. Could improve on salary and work life balance it seems if junior roles do not earn enough.
good,"Difficult working in an office with mismanaged sales team, observing the sales force leaving the company to continue their careers with competitive mortgage companies."
good,Worked as Analyst for 3 years where we use to data management and data base process. Also we use process management information system. I also worked for night shitfs.
good,This job promoted team values.  I learned a lot in the mortgage industry. A highly considerate work environment that promoted diversity.  Company did not promote from within in a reasonable amount of time.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,At Wells Fargo you are exposed to gain basic accounting skills while assisting customers in managing their finances. Wells Fargo offers a variety of accounts both personal and commercial.
good,Great company to work for but the sales culture is intense.  You are required to pull in business by any and all methods regardless if the retail bank or business banking team is working on their regulatory documents for over a year.
good,Working at Wells Fargo Advisors was  an eye opening experience into the financial world. On a day to day basis I would assist managing client documents and I would help with ensuring all data was correct before closing out their file.
good,"Fast pace, deadline driven and customer focused. respect for confidentiality. Compliance focused on BSA AML, OFAC/PEP and Patriot Act is at the forefront of Wells Fargo concern."
good,"All talk...heavily process driven, too many meetings, disgruntled culture. Promotes from within only. Mediocre at best.  Everyone is always on vacation who is fulltime, consultants do most of the work but get the least amount of credit or voice."
good,"managers don’t have your back when it comes to sales lead"
good,For the short time i was employed the job taught me la lot about how banking works. I met a lot of different people. They have good benefits. Its a nice place to work for.
good,"The routine is very mundane. Same thing everyday. "
good,"Wells Fargo is so big that someone can have many different careers within one company, which I believe is the biggest appeal to working for a bank of Wells Fargo's size."
good,People you work with were always friendly and motivational. It seem as tho management wanted to cut on man power and have tellers connect with more customer as more people lined up to use our services.
good,"It was great interacting with regular people on a daily basis. However meeting ""solutions"" goals was the highest priority. There were incentives to not be transparent about what customers were signing up for."
good,"Keeping up with all the changes.  Understanding there is a lot that needs to be changed, the amount of change is almost overwhelming as you deal with both corporate changes and department changes."
good,"Good work environment, In store branch. Came in lead casher would count drawer before and after shift. Management was relaxed, always willing to help and answer questions. Hardest part of job was trying cash a  checks with insufficient funds to a non banker customer. Most enjoyable part was coworkers and how we all got along."
good,"I don’t remember all the details your requiring. I just wrote something so Indeed can stop asking this question."
good,"things changed daily. you have to be able to adapt to change. managers need to be more knowledgeable about their positions."
good,Mandatory after hours meetings requiring each employee to make cold calls .  Sales are required of employees to push products and obtain solicitation goals set my upper management.
good,"Enjoyed the banking aspect, enjoyed helping people with their finances.  Resigned from position for another job opportunity working for Summerwinds Resorts."
good,"A typical day is getting sales up. I have learned how to interact with people and how to sell different product offered but he institution."
good,"I like the company, I was just in a environment  that I couldn't grow in. I don't speak spanish and in the location that I was working at most of the clients were Hispanic. There was a lot of pressure to open accounts for people that couldn't keep up with the account(s) they had."
good,"Like most finance companies, change is always frequent.  Mergers and acquisitions happen all the time.  I can say that with most job cuts they do give employees good severance packages."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Thorough and great benefits. Vigorously positive mindset towards charitable giving, volunteerism and diversity. Preference for promoting from within. Management currently in a state which seems more reactive than proactive."
good,I was a temporary worker in the Document control dept. Not treated   well as a temp. we were pushed aside and talked down to  from management.  Were not included on team outings or at the Christmas party.
good,I retired from Wachovia which is not Wells Fargo.  I retired before it became Wells Fargo so I do not know much about the company and their direction. I have only heard from people that I know still work there.
good,It was ok... I was over qualified for the position submitted as a contractor but yet when it was time to try to get hired from within I was over looked...
good,"I haven't worked there since 2013, but I was a banker. It wasn't a great place to work, but I'm guessing it's better since they've felt the wrath of the way employees are treated. I was paid timely and the benefits were good."
good,"Find a good department that fits your skills and avoid managers who play politics and/or departments with poor, exclusive cultures. Its really up to you to take initiative and be proactive in your career development. Lateral move(s) may be necessary"
good,One of the best benefits offered by Wells Fargo is the ability to work from home.  They provide you with access to system and also you are able to work from any where in the world.
good,Nothing negative about the company. It was a different world with the current manager I worked with when I was there. She was more focused on what you were wearing and the sales than how you are feeling or just overall function of the branch.
good,"The people I worked with were great, I just didn't like how much we had to push products on customers. It became more of a sales job and less of a customer service job. I did not like that part of it at all."
good,"upper management is horrible makes it bad on the rest of the employees. work day life isn't bad depending on your locations, but the pettiness at WF is something you cant miss"
good,"I liked working at Wells Fargo, however it was a temporary position and I did not have an opportunity to transition to a full-time employee. I am unable to provide feedback for fte's."
good,It's ok. Your typical bank job. There are no real bells and whistles. There are good days and bad ones. There are a lot of changes happening right now that make working here very uncertain.
good,Typical day began with reviewing e-mails.  Learned different types of financial systems. Management was very hands on. Workplace culture was relax.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the traffic in getting to work
good,"Wells Fargo as a company is overall awesome, but the phone bank department isn't what they tell you in training, RUN if you want to have a life and feel like you value within your company. Rain, Sleet, or Snow, even HOlIDAY'S the Phone Bank department WILL BE OPEN."
good,I enjoyed my career time with WF but got a better offer and more pay at Regions.  Faster advancement was offered at Regions so it was the best move for me at that time.
good,"Part-time job while in college.  Very good for that.  Had a good time working there, our manager was awesome!  Had to leave because I was working on my accounting degree and needed to do something in that field."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells has been fine. Nothing amazing. My specific team is good, but the company is constantly in the news from a new scandal. It gets old quickly. My team was not customer facing nor did we have anything to do with them, but it was hard to tell people you work there without being embarrassed."
good,Good opportunity if you enjoy working with people and handling the responsibility of handling large sums of money and monetary transactions. Requires focus.
good,"It was a ok place to wok. Alot of  growing to do as far as management, but out side of that the company is a good company. I would recommend working there if your interested in sales."
good,Personal Banker position is mainly getting people signed up with more products people may or may not want.  Referrals for loans etc.  Opening new accounts is the name of the game there.
good,"I enjoyed working there when I was younger but the pay was not efficient for long term. As a wife and soon to mother, I would need to make more pay to be able to survive comfortably."
good,Very limited career development path for young bankers. Too many layers of managers result in inefficiency. Very slow promotion and the compensation not competitive.
good,Great experience overall and learned a lot.  If you want to work hard and climb the ladder opportunities are there.  You need to apply yourself and collaborate.
good,Wells Fargo is a good company but has to many layers of management. It was hard to get all of management to coincide with each other. Very stressful place to work.
good,Job was stressfull high paced what they wanted from you conflicted constant overturns low retention. No cups offered and no water fountain. First day went through 8 hours without water.
good,Great company for a starting career. Very slow career progression and high management turnover leading to a lot of confusion between employees. Great training at the start. More development opportunities should be introduced throughout the career
good,I do not care to review this company.  I am only interested in posting through Indeed.com.  This section is just a placeholder to meet the minimum required words.
good,"The experience was stressful, very sales driven, and not very flexible when I was wanting to return to school. It is a good starting position, you gain great experience with how  financial institutions work and how to conduct yourself professionally but not ideal for longterm."
good,I was a loan processor at the height of the 2nd mortgage boom.  we were busy all the time.  the hardest part of the job was telling someone that their house was not worth what they thought it was.
good,Wells Fargo has many opportunities to advance for those willing to work hard. Conditions have improved after company changed sales policies which were forced on the bankers and tellers and the old CEO was booted.
good,In my previous role I worked in conjunction with Loan Officers and Underwriters to ensure a timely and accurate experience for the customer throughout the mortgage process. That experience will benefit me in my next role as a loan officer.
good,Time spent on phone attempting to resolve collection issues with past due customers arranging renegotiating payment arrangements and repossession of collateral when necessary
good,An opportunity to learn and develop your skills and advance depending on your own personal goals.  the company allows its individuals to work flexible hours depending on their position and communicate and collaborate with individuals that are geographically-dispersed in various parts of the globe.
good,it has been a learning experience. my boss is great.  regulations drive banking and wells does its part to keep us on top of those regulations.  i'm happy to work there aas it has providing me with upward movement in my career.
good,The management team had no say in any function they had control over. They were just told what to do & how to do it by upper management. No clear goals were set in place for job advancement. Upper management were only worried about the budget & had no care about employee retention. Even though it would cost more to train new employees then give the small promotion that was promised in the first place.
good,"Very high pace job, on the phone and computer at the same time. Every aspect of the job was micro managed to benefit the bank. The best part of the job was helping the customers get their loans."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work management always were interested in you opinions and new ideas. our weekly meeting were productive and informative.
good,"Following Wells Fargo's acquisition of Wachovia, I have not been given the tools and training that I need to be successful.  The reward for good work is more work.  Management trusts external consultants more than the people that work in the trenches.  Flat salaries during a decade of record growth were the norm.  I lost money by staying here due to inflation outpacing wage growth.  When looking at job postings, the external applicant has equal footing with the internal applicant."
good,coworkers are awesome. no sales! manangers try to force to talk to customers about things that are not beneficial to them. ......................................
good,Very Good Benefits and a company that offered a decent amount of overtime every now and then. I was there quite a bit some time and really learned a lot from my peers.
good,"Great place to begin banking career"
good,Good job but there was little to no room for advancement or to grow with the company. You’re pretty much expected to do the same thing for 5-10+ years.
good,"Did not stay long with the company since no one seemed to move beyond current role. Not really what I was looking for. "
good,It was a satisfactory place to work for IT contractors. The environment is formal and very professional. It's a large corporate employee work environment and has  a large corporate culture not although some divisions can seem like a small business culture.
good,Wells Fargo has been overall a very decent employer.  Even after the questionable practices it did create some room for growth and opportunity within management.
good,The management culture at Wells Fargo was lacking values of diversity that I was looking for in a workplace. There is room to grow in this aspect. The best part of my job was meeting a lot of people.
good,This is a great company to start off but not for a long term career or at least wasn't a good fit for me. Very strict place to work doesn't jive well with the younger generation.
good,Big changes over the past 10 years make this not a wonderful place for a career. Many jobs are now out sourced and More experienced workers are replaced with inexperienced help
good,"Company has just gone through changes and was heading toward new changes in management.  The company relocated and changes was made however, we had great benefit package and the Addison location was great."
good,"I was a contract employee via AeroTek for about six months. The work was slow and monotonous, and my supervisor was often seen playing Angry Birds on his iPad."
good,Part time work. Great training. Great atmosphere. Great entry level work. Customer service training. Decent pay. Little hours. Entry level work. Bank teller
good,Wells was a good company to work for. The work life balance was not as good as i would have liked it to be but it was a job and it paid the bills. I would recommend it
good,Learned a lot about finances and working with customers to understand about finances. Working with my TMs and customers everyday always made me happy to make a difference in that moment.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"good people my co-workers, supervisor Adele Federico was awesome...just didn't like the micro-management and the atmosphere of the job...my job position at Wells were a learning experience and knowledge i will take with me"
good,"Multiple tasks to complete before opening doors"
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company to start your banking career with. They specialize in ensuring you are prepared before you walk onto the floor. If you are looking for a easy starting point, there is where I would begin."
good,"I would only recommend this job to a friend if they were in need of sales and banker training. Their training is incredibly good and hands on not webinar training. Other than that, I was not pleased with how sales was number one and customers were on the back burner. The way customers were treated and the hounding of sales requirements was a very negative side to this job. I loved the customers and the co-workers, but the management was very negative as all they wanted from us was sales sales sales and we had a fear of losing our jobs if we did not produce. For those that sales does not come easily, I would not recommend this job."
good,"Typical day was focused on sales or widgets"
good,There was no management guidance and opportunity to engage with the department in Houston. My skills and knowledge were not used as I did not have the opportunity to present them.
good,"nice place to work, people very friendly. Location was excellent, being downtown. This was a temporary contract position which worked out well. No major issues"
good,"Its a call center and you help uneducated people with their finances what else is there to do? unless you move up and get paid to do nearly nothing, but thats just me."
good,"it helped me to get to where i am. sales point, customer service, and teamwork. learning about compliance and regulations helped me to know about what i needed to know about the mortgage industry."
good,"Many projects going on with resources being spread thin on each one.  On the plus side, there are a lot of great people who are working hard and are willing to help you if they can."
good,Work environment was positive/ nice work life balance.  Would recommend it to future interested candidates.  Management was great to work with. Various locations so easily accessible.
good,"Went through Financial Advisor program. What they don't tell you is that 80-90% of new advisors will opt out within first 2 years.  General training was ok, but they pushed outdated cold calling techniques."
good,I very much enjoyed working with my co-workers in the local office.  The mortgage loan process was awkward.  We had to go through so many layers to ensure there was no fraud that it made it difficult to close loans in a timely manner.  The operations center management was very derogatory to branch employees.
good,"Great company, despite all the news headlines these days. Very structured, allows for little autonomy. But very great company to grow and promote within."
good,It was ok but if boss got overwhelmed she showed it in front of customers and then everyone else was overwhelmed. then the customers would become upset.
good,I don't have much to say besides that the management is so inconsistent that it makes it very hard to work in multiple locations. management doesn't care as much as they should about employees.
good,overall my experience with Wells Fargo was not the best due to the management that i had report back to because i was under them. But the people i met where wonderful and pleasant to be around.
good,Not happy with the environment.  i love working with the customers. the costumers are the best part of the job. the benefits are very interesting too!
good,"a fast paced work environment, very competitive when sales was a factor. i felt most comfortable in that environment because it eventually drives you to perform."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Overall my experience was ok. I worked hard and performed my daily responsibilities. I was promoted within 3 months but ultimately wanted to pursue other career opportunities and expand my overall knowledge and skill set within the financial industry. I did not think the performance evaluation guidelines were relative to the daily responsibilities and production standards within my position.
good,Many products to offer to customers. Just like any other job it has its highs and lows. All branches in area work together to service customers. Variety of customers.
good,Worked a lot of hours and others got credit for the work that was done. Spent a lot of time working on things that would be outdated the following year.
good,"I worked in many departments throughout my 23 years at Wells.  For the most part, it was good.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and helping customers."
good,I have worked for the company for 10 + years and we never get more than 1-2% a year 'raise' - its a common complaint. WF salaries have huge variances.
good,"I was brought in to manage a high priority project. That completed ahead of schedule and had the flexibility to move into another position without delay. There is a very formal structure to the projects and PMO office, which is a good thing."
good,There is a lot of negative information being put out by Wells Fargo which requires us to have to explain things to clients that we have no control over
good,okay place to start if you need a chance to learn. Not so much interested in making good loan officers as finding good (read: maleable) sales people. Management rarely understands the intricacies of good customer service.
good,Working for Wells Fargo is a very good move but only if your going to work in the financial industry. Its a good company especially when you are looking to advance.
good,The day was always busy and the expectation was always more than you could offer.  I was there a very long time but do not miss the craziness and month end rush at all.
good,"Typical day at Wells Fargo includes staying on phones for 93% of your day, adhering to strict schedule, working solo most of the time, and dealing with escalated customers regularly."
good,I have nothing to share or review to complete this section of the review.  I have been gone from Wells Fargo since 2015 and there have been many changes since I left.
good,I had no issues at this workplace other than a discrepancy I had with a coworker. I called my recruiter for help and was then fired for reasons that were not valid.
good,"I worked 8-5 Mon-Fri----I collected on business credit card & lines of credit accounts under 30 days delinquent---the workplace culture was  good, acceptable, and not stressful----the hardest part of the job was working via an autodialer---the most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers to resolve the delinquency of the account."
good,Managers are professional.  Good work environment.  Good training.  Lack of communication between teams.  Peer pressure in corporate culture.  Treatment of contractors less favorable compared to regular full-time employees.
good,there was a lot to learn over the 28yrs I worked there. I enjoyed working at the bank for the most part it was hardest when learning new jobs. enjoyable part was the people they made it fun and liked going to work.
good,"Managed buildout of Interesting pilot program. Good team members to work with. Very talented in their positions, willing . to help get the project up to speed in a short timeframe."
good,"October 2018"
good,WF is a good place towork from a temps point of view. However trying to get hired by WF wasn't possible for some reason. Working with onsite support was pretty good.
good,The company culture was fragmented and managers unwilling to work as a team or grow as an organization.  The company is extremely large and teams are located across the country which makes it hard to function as a cohesive team.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I worked here when it was originally Norwest Mortgage.  It was as that time a great place to work. After the merger with Wells Fargo a lot of things changed but we were still able to make a good salary and even won trips. We processed, underwrote and closed loans out of our branch.  Then the processing was centralized in Atlanta.  Our boss however made sure that all the ones that wanted to continue working there had jobs as Loan office assistants.  Eventually processing was brought back to the branch. I worked with Wells Fargo a long time and saw higher management begin to take from  lower management, loan officers and processors.  It got to the point with some that they could no longer make enough money to pay their bills. The stress became so bad that one by one people started to leave.  The branch i worked for was a very family oriented branch who stuck together as long as we could."
good,"I worked for Wells Fargo for 13 years and was recently displaced by a re-organization.  Throughout my career, I expanded my understanding of the financial world by working in wholesale, correspondent and retail lending."
good,"Good benefits.  Team leadership needs some work,  My first team the leader was all but absent and the work director did all the work.  My second team was a total change.  This lady was hands on and willing to help.  Taking on phone calls, assisting with your pipeline to being sure you as a person were ok"
good,"In the beginning, everyone was on the same level but that changed once you became buddies with certain people or on certain teams."
good,I enjoyed working for the company. and enjoyed my peers. job was fairly easy. most customers too. good days and bad days but that's at any job. would recommend
good,"The people I worked with made working at WF enjoyable. When I was working there the sales goals that  were the main goal for the company. Ive heard that since then it has changed, I hope so!"
good,I haven't worked there since 2017 but hoping WF's culture and leadership has changed by now for the overall benefit of its customers. It was and has the potential to be a great place to work again.
good,Wells fargo gave me the opportunity to learn cash handling and met a lot of people from different branches. Great workplace for a part time or full time employees.
good,"This was a great opportunity for me because it gave me a chance to sharpen my skills in relation to files with complex, self-employed income.  The experience was key into my growth as an underwriter."
good,"One of the manager plays favor. The one she likes got promotion easily without having to do the job he scares and hates, repeatedly left work undone for co-workers to cover."
good,"The downside to working for Wells Fargo is their no public transportation to the facility."
good,We developed a trading system to support a desk on the trading floor. Each week we have one developer sitting next to the user as direct production support
good,"Development team tries to follow the Agile development methodology. Get requirements from business users, design the system with the help of business analyst. Sprint planning. Retro-meeting. Task oriented"
good,"While Wells Fargo was pressing hard the public image of a company that approves people for loans who might not otherwise qualify, they never would actually approve these loans.  I received a large volume of applicants with lower income or higher DTI or lower down payments who were immediately rejected by Wells Fargo's system even though they should have been eligible for the programs advertised."
good,The environment is very fast paced and the turn around is very aggressive. The management is under a lot of pressure from the higher ups about sales and meeting goals
good,The technology at WF is not up to par for a fortune 500 company.  The company needs to focus on building trust with their consumers and taking care of its employees.
good,"I work on a production floor and do different kinds of functions through out the day. Though they are the same task, each one is different and every day I can learn something new."
good,Busy work environment. Managers willing to assist when needed. Other departments worked together for a better outcome for the customer. Management always took time to get to know the teams and employees and would assist when needed.
good,"It is a very professional environment, people are friendly and we did group work to try to find bette ways to serve customer and to better the environment for the employees."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo offers 16 weeks maternity leave for employees full time employees. Their health care plans are comparable as well. I will say it was embarrassing to admit working for this company with all the scandals continuously popping up, however I have never worked a department that would engage in such things."
good,"It's a hit or miss. You can find some very professional, hard working, managers with excellent leadership skills and some others who are just there for a pay check. There tends to be a lot of politics when it comes to career advancement and recently there have been a great effort from the upper level management to hire outside of the company. Don't expect any perks (free lunch, snacks...), the company is trying to reduce expenses and it shows."
good,Wells Fargo is a good way to pay your bills. It's not too stressful. There are a lot of different jobs to choose from. I would work there again. it's not bad.
good,"I worked closely with a lot of good people who pushed me to be a better employee.  However, I also worked with several who care only about their own success.  I'm sure this can be said for most all companies."
good,Stay busy and keep striving for your goals and you will survive. If you do not hit your targeted goals then this is not for you. If your looking to move up based on performance then this will work for you.
good,"The management here was some of the best I've ever had. They did an excellent job of making team members feel involved, but they were slaves to the corporate office. They routinely had to ask OCSR II team members to perform sales and technical duties that should have been performed by other departments. They said they wouldn't be setting sales goals after the debacle of 2016, but HQ was back at it within a year. Trying to get customers to agree to services and good they didn't need. "
good,"Many managers are not readily willing to offer job advancement for even the most qualified candidates. Sometimes it depended on who you knew that could give you a leg up. If you can find a manager that will not micro-manage but coach you along the way, you are lucky. I was lucky in that way a couple of times in 12 years."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company to work for, but I have notice a pattern in management. They micro managed there employees, they dont listen. Feels like you are in a prison.They allow the title to get to them. More focus on the title than leadership."
good,"Pros : I liked the location and work culture. Wells fargo is a good company to work. "
good,"I managed team member by motivate, training.  I was Branch Manager and was responsible for the overall day to day operation of the Branch.  Recognized as one of the top manager in SC."
good,Company complaint calls fraud settlement issues call center eight hours back to back good benefits set hours per week good training class great work experience good people to work with great management
good,"from opening to close - taking care of the customers and the bank"
good,"good training, hands on director and supervisors, ability to train and learn new potions and new outlooks on customer service aspects.  multiple avenues of work collaborating with other departments."
good,"Wonderful place to work great atAtmosphere made tons of life long and close friends, great and affordable living and pay, terrific benefits and perks to each job"
good,Stay in sales and don't go to the fulfillment side.  Fulfillment positions are regularly laid off.  They tend to have favorites but promote a lot from within.
good,"2008-2009 when I worked there high sells goals for tellers, great staff at my branch, occasional Saturday hours, staff made the day enjoyable, hours are not flexible, great benefits."
good,"Culture is a bit more laid back in Charlotte versus what one would experience in New York. The senior bankers are very talented, but there is a high degree of variability in talent at the junior level (analyst to associate, and some VPs). Better work-life balance than one would see in New York"
good,While being employed at Wells Fargo I realized it was a very family oriented organization to be employed for. The hours were flexible and management made being employed there a fun environment.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The culture is still a highly sales environment. they say its no sales goals but there is. They have ranches and you are rated on these ranges if you are a manager. District Managers are not providing the coaching and development to there team members.
good,This position is no longer available here in town.  They ended it years ago.  Training at that time seemed standard.  As everyone knows by passed news of Wells Fargo they pushed their employees to meet goals that were not achievable.  No employee should be made to feel threatened to keep there position over excessive selling goals.
good,"Reviewed credit bureaus to extend credit.  "
good,Wells Fargo is a large bank and offers a good work environment.  The Banking side of the company ran into a little trouble with the government and the mortgage side of the company was also fined a few years back for various violations.
good,"My work load could be daunting at times. However, my management team was very supportive of me releasing some steam and getting a good workout at the gym."
good,"Wells Fargo in it's self was a good company with good benefits. "
good,"unprofessional environment "
good,"huge company great support team as far as back office is concerned, at the time i was there super cutthroat culture, super fast paced always busy at lease my location was"
good,it is a good company but the branch I was working for lacked good management. the managers were too intense and not I a good way. they laced proper team management and better communication skills when it comes to speaking to some of the employees. The branch was just disorganized which would make the job harder.
good,Great place to work and the position that I held was a terrific position. I was a temp without the opportunity to get hired on since the company needs where being met.
good,"Lack of management, direction and accountability is why I left."
good,Good company with a solid training program. They just have the tendency to over hire and then let people go when the market adjust. So be careful as to what type of job you apply for.
good,"Wasn't a good company to work for back then, leads don't get distrubuted equal or evenly it all depends on who you know. "
good,"Good it was long ago that I worked here, but I remember it help me growth on my business, great employees who were always ready to coach you and help you"
good,My career at Wells Fargo assisted in advancing to the next step in my career. The experience gained there allowed me to move in to a government contract role.
good,"process documentation and analysis"
good,"Typical day at work and you can learn a lot by visiting the online learning and development online courses. Very diverse atmosphere."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Most of the people emplyed there were amazing to work with and for, unfortunately there are those few bad apples in management that cause turn over. The fact that they have closed a call center almost every 9 months the past 1.5 yrs is a little scary. Stability is important to me."
good,"Company was good, but very hard on sales. pay and benefits were good. Minus the sales aspect, it would have been a great company to stay with. Due to the sales, I changed professions."
good,"Good benefits and room for advancement. Typical of a large company, lower level employees sometimes get lost in the shuffle. Company prides itself on promoting within."
good,Company does not cater to the customer anymore they are all about numbers and not customer service.  They have become too big to care anymore.  Benefits are great
good,I have enjoyed working for this company. They gave me an opportunity to learn and grow and develop new skills. These benefits helped me transition from a successful career in radio to banking
good,"Working as a phone banker was always stressful and I dreaded going to work everyday. The benefits were good, and the pay was decent. Training was 6 weeks paid which was also nice."
good,"This was not a job of interest once i got into the position. I was not educated on it not enough training giving, assit base leanding can be a great job if the traning is dont right."
good,"Working for Wells Fargo was a great experience! I learned much more money handling ,independence, customer service. However, I felt like I wasn't growing with the company so I relocated and changed employment."
good,"I worked for Wells Fargo fresh out of high school, and learned valuable work skills in both the administrative and customer service realms. My supervisory team was top notch."
good,"sales were the main thing when they were evaluating everyone, thats why they got in trouble. they pushed people to sales and cheat customers so they can make profits."
good,it had it moments. ups and downs with clients. training on computer is harder then face to face. was in the news a lot with sales goals but doesn't have them anymore
good,a typical day at work - clock in open the mail process loan documents. Easy to get along with co-workers and management. new manager had positive energy.
good,Can’t complain too much but don’t have many compliments. Decent work and life balance but at times I did not agree with How the company handled certain situations when times got tough.
good,Its been way too long for me to provide an accurate review of WF at this point.  Not sure why this is a required field given the length of time that has passed since my employment with WF.
good,"The work was at times stressful, and production goals were unrealistic. The compensation was typicall for this line of business. There was drama in which I did not care for"
good,"It was a good company to work for with great movement opportunities. The pay was good for the work that I did. Management was a little spotty, but overall okay!"
good,Answering calls regarding accounts. account updates and reviews working with multiple systems at once in order to access the customer. Also providing product and service  that best meets the customer needs.
good,"You work by yourself most of the day, you also have technicians that help you fix and maintain the machine. It was a night shift job and they paid a 15% difference if you work after 4pm."
good,Wells Fargo with a great company when it comes to employees and the environment very fun and friendly. But one thing they did like in management skills
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Very professional helpful staff.  Staff were approachable, and easy to work with.  Many went out of their way to assist.  My only comment would be that the contract positions are not always as secure as they are stated at the beginning of the contract."
good,"Typical day is just cash handling, must be very meticulous and organize. Co workers showed a lot of support when help was needed. Long working hours at times."
good,I had a great trainer to learn the functions of the job which made transitioning to the floor an ease. Expectations and standards were well defined. Overall a great experience.
good,Work life balance is difficult in technology. Work environment is inclusive for the most part - many international team members. Work hours are flexible and I have the ability to work from home.
good,Advancement was EXTREMELY DIFFICULT at Wells Fargo.  Training was available and opportunity to do other assignments but not actual advancement opportunities.
good,The culture was very sales aggressive.  I witnessed unethical behavior in attempts to reach sales goals in order to earn incentives.  Very disappointing.
good,"Based on the recent reorganizations at my Company and in the group I am in, morale is at an all-time low, and employees are struggling with all the job changes and new responsibilities associated with all the changes."
good,my job during college. I had great experiences which got overshadowed by the downfall of the company with media attention. the fast pace was appreciated but some policies were unrealistic.
good,"branch closed"
good,"Not learning from history of sale practice, unqualified management, segmentation of ability forced roadblocks. Predatory sales environment lacked quality overview of customer experience."
good,Brokers could make environment very stressful.
good,"Good management, typical day worked through loans, sent files to closing, team meetings, review files with AE's if necessary. "
good,huddle with everyone in a pilot branch my job as a PBS and a business advocate. Mentor new hire and teach them how to work with our customers. Great customer service.
good,"Can be a great place to work and build a career with little or no experience in the field.  The company has become a lot more customer focused and has no sales requirements, only that customers are helped efficiently and effectively."
good,"I was promoted and offered a corporate move with Wachovia Securities in 2008, just five months before Wachovia Securities became Wells Fargo Advisors.  "
good,"I really can't weigh in on this topic.  I was only there  a few weeks as a contract worker.  My friend works there though, and she seems to have generally positive things to say."
good,"I worked for ERC which was contracted with Wells Fargo I didn't work directly at Wells Fargo. Working at Call Center for 9:00 am to 5:45 pm. Working as call center representative is very restrictive in movement, you are tied to the desk."
good,"Review emails"
good,"overwork but you get paid"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I did not like to sell to customers to meet monthly minimums. It turned very competitive and often times caused issues between coworkers. "
good,"Due to the growing nature of the investment bank, all levels are encouraged to voice opinions and take part in pitch creation, new ideas and meetings with clients. The day to day changes frequently with ad hoc requests coming up often. Management is pretty good about not overworking junior team members and ensuring that not only are junior team members processing the work, but also understanding the bigger picture. The workplace culture is overall decent, however miscommunication between groups and politics often can be a disruption."
good,"It is hard to move from a bank branch to corporate job. Most people choose to get out by going through mortgage. They also only give a 20% increase when you move from job to job, even if base salary is higher"
good,It is a great and good place to work with. The people here are very good and very professional. Work culture is very good and I like it very well. Good in planning the things well in advance.
good,"My task was just a review the expense of card holder."
good,"TekSystems is a good company to work for if you like contracting - however, don't expect to be treated special. it's just a contracting gig.. that's all."
good,Wells Fargo is a good place to start your professional experience. They have fairly good health insurance.  They do offer job coaching and opportunities to advance.
good,The staff at Wells Fargo make it really easy to create a work life balance. The managers are super knowledgable and always there to give their guidance.
good,I enjoyed helping the customers work out a suitable settlement or repayment agreement. I also appreciated the different options for the customers to be able to stay in their homes.
good,"Its was ok, I learned a lot about banking a the financial industry.  Also got quite a bit of customer service experience.  Worked with a lot of great people and a few that were not"
good,"Regular Job- Overall no real complaints, competitive market, numbers driven company.Great for college graduates who are trying to get in the finance world."
good,Very passive environment. With little room to grow. If you start of as a teller you are encouraged to go the entire teller route of upward mobility. rarely is cross promotions supported. i.e. from teller to banker.
good,Stressful and not enough pay. But based on their competitors that pay decent. It just doesn't provide and work life balance. Managers were great but they're task me them non approachable. Many people cant see between the two.
good,"The work/life balance and the benefits are outstanding.  Flexible working hours.  However the landscape of this particular job changes rapidly with little to no training, guidance, or communication from management which created several pain points.   "
good,"I worked at Wachovia, then Wells Fargo bought them & displaced may Wachovia employees, therefore, I can not really answer much about Wells Fargo since I did not work for them."
good,"Great benefits, paid time off, paid holidays, free checking out, health beneifits, flexible hours, no drug test but this is a stressful job! You will be on your feet all day and you will need to know a lot. Over worked and under paid!"
good,"At first it’ll be boring and difficult but once you get the hang of it, piece of cake. If you have a hard time with communicating this will help you grow and advance in your communication skills"
good,"The work was good, the hiring process was not communicated well and only after being notified of a layoff was it discussed in greater detail. Better clear communication is key at any company."
good,Slow paced but stressful.Poor management at the location I was in. Good company to work for but too much pressure in regards to offering products to customers.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"They offer a great training program. Typical day at work is 9-6. I learned a lot in terms of customer service, business continuity plans, cash handling, etc. Workplace culture is good, but could be much more professional as people oftentimes get ""too comfortable"". Hardest part of the job was staying motivated because you don't always get the career advancement you deserve, although it is promised. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with your usual customers."
good,"Help Customers"
good,This is a great company for when you first exit college. It is a company that will look good on a resume. The management overall does not seem to manage stress well and many are quick to go into panic mode.
good,I wouldn't recommend anyone working here . It was really hard to move up due allot of favouritism. And constant change because the bank consistently staying in the news.
good,"I was a temp here. They had a reputation at the time that they hire/fire temps instead of hiring them to permanent positions as is the hope of most temp workers . If they could manage without us for a full day, they would send us home early without pay for the full day. They generally treated temps badly, not including them in social events as regular employees, which left a bad taste in my mouth. Too bad, I really liked my team there. I left for a permanent position elsewhere."
good,Good environment to work at good management and potential for growth. Great training and opportunity for overtime. Great benefits medical and retirement.
good,"Good place to work. I learned more about working with people, or the benefits of a team work. The management was fair according to me. The workplace culture was fair."
good,"I have worked here for one year and a half now, I applied for a higher position right before a pay raise which I wasn't included in. I have been in this role for about 6 months now, and I'm ready to move up."
good,"You get mass hired and typically start as a teller. It becomes very stressful for many times management wants you to "" sell "" products and services that clients dont need. "
good,"I've been working for WF on their customer excellence team for a year and a half. I started at a rate that I was making in my twenties. I was advised that there would be opportunities in the future for advancement and more money. After doing many different jobs that I was made to believe would lead to a promotion, I was sadly disappointed to only find that the promotion was given to an outsider. So much for promoting from within. Needless to say, now looking for something outside the company."
good,"This was a good company overall to work with, I just wish the staffing was more consistent alone with different rules regulated throughout the branches. The culture is in re-build mode so its hard to gauge where it currently is, but I am very grateful for the opportunity that was given to me."
good,I worked for Wells Fargo Financial for almost 5 years and was never able to internally transfer. I was also getting good reviews but my applications always went unanswered.
good,"Answered 50-100 calls a day"
good,Overall I had a good experience with Wells Fargo. I was laid off because of restructuring and I did apply for other positions within Wells Fargo and although I had over 15 years in the banking industry I did feel that when a position was opened that they already had someone in mind and they were going through the process and did not have the intention of hiring the best person for the job.
good,I really enjoyed working at Wells Fargo. All the managers and trainers were very helpful and encouraging. It is a workplace where they definitely expect near perfection.
good,Working here was a means to an end. I did not enjoy working here but needed to pay my bills. My ex-husband was military and this one of the few jobs that I could get at the time.
good,"Poor communication skills amongst LOB managers. Very slow follow up time on issues. Don't really seem to be too concerned when it is brought up how much money is being lost due to a poorly written policy. Managers had no ability to train and develop team members, most had only a small idea what the team members they manage are actually doing. Ability to work independently was nice. Very little idea of what my managers actually did on a daily basis. They seemed to spend a lot of time on phone calls, but very seldom actually communicated what was being talked about."
good,"Was able to learn a lot about the mortgage servicing industry through my own research and willingness to absorb my work environment. Most frustrating part of job was the attitude of most managers. They were unwilling to hear out most concerns brought fourth by the team, mostly due to the fact that it was very likely they did not understand why we felt it was an issue and what the long term consequences might be. They seemed more concerned with what they could do to make their manager happy. This usually meant blindly following directives that did not make sense to our team, and the rationale behind those directives could not be explained for some reason. Other than my experience with most of the management team, I enjoyed my time working here."
good,Great place to participate in other professional training. Flexible hours. Some travel which supports mission of the company.  Food vendors allowed on site.
good,"Very competitive, unfair pay, treatment of tellers were terrible. Benefits were great, pay is the best. Coworkers were great and energetic. Overall, I learned a lot from the company. I believe my last branch was the worst. Great company, just watch who's district you apply for."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"busy work day, keeping track of large amounts of money, review deposit documents like checks and IDs friendly and enjoyable environment. management was OK just didn't want to have their employees advance."
good,About what you'd expect from a big bank. Fairly old fashioned and uptight compared to something like a tech firm.  However the pay and benefits are great as long as you're in the investment bank.
good,"Good company to work for if you're just starting your adult life. The approach and the careful attention to detail in the wells fargo environment makes you bring your ""A"" game every day."
good,Wells Fargo is a place to work if you do not have any other options. I worked as an Online  Customer Service Rep and it was very stressful. You aren't offered enough pay for the job.
good,"I worked here on a temp basis, so I was here when they were transition from Wachovia to Wells Fargo and just assisted with the merger by calling customers advising them of the merger"
good,"24 hour operation "
good,Really too much was going on not enough good supervisors half of them didn't know how to help with question's  or calls so they days were pretty hectic
good,Company not going in the right direction. To many things done for the wrong reasons. Products and services not benefiting the customers just paying the higher ups.
good,"My typical works days were very relaxed. I did not learn enough to make me successful in my position. Management was friendly, but distant. Workplace culture was alright. The hardest part of this job was trying to build the right relationships and network enough. The most enjoyable part was the flexible schedule."
good,"I would not recommend no one to work at wells fargo, they pressure people with sales and the customers end up leaving upset.  its the worst place i have ever worked"
good,This was a typical large commercial banking environment that did not offer enough opportunity for creative individuals to grow and respond to community concerns.
good,"Good place to work, depending on your group and manager.  I worked in mortgage, but there are a myriad of departments and locations to choose from, so overall good company to work for."
good,"•	Processed mortgage loans for borrowers wanting to refinance their homes"
good,Good experience. The training was very detailed and supportive. It is a great place to work. The hours are flexible for those who are in college or have kids.
good,"During my employment at WF, the management focused on sales goals so it was very competitive and stressful at times. I loved working with my clients for most of them are truly nice. The hardest part of my job was standing all day- back then tellers were not allowed to sit (unless you have a medical necessity to do so)."
good,"Most Managers were good to work with."
good,"answered calls, sold products to maximize saving potential for customers, developed better sales tactics, alot room, for growth, quick paced environment"
good,i worked at wells fargo before they were sued millions for the false made accounts. i was watched and basically forced to force products on people. it has now changed(i hope). i still bank with them. i havent had any complaints on that end. im sure they have made changes since i worked there.
good,The people are nice and do make you feel part of the community. It is a fast past environment but there is always some one there to help you. as long as you try your best.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Are you truly collaborative? Succeeding at Wells Fargo means respecting, understanding and trusting colleagues and clients. Challenging others and being challenged in return. Being passionate about what you do. Driving yourself forward, always wanting to do things the right way."
good,This was an amazing job one of my very 1st jobs and i loved it always wanted to be in this field i love helping people and being in a professional environment i aim to please
good,"Typical work day is never the same - various challenge and tasks day - to day "
good,"a good place to grow a career, you can learn a lot, and there is room to advance. Management is decent, and work life balance is a struggle.  A lot of changes going on."
good,many positives and negatives to this company.  Very large company with a culture that can be good and bad. They try.  I worked multiple positions at Wells Fargo.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is that management is layed back and you have a flexible work schedule. There is opportunity for advancement within leadership.
good,"I had to leave for an emergency surgery and they would not put me on full time, I was let go as soon as the 3 months was up. I was never even considered. I went to work early every day with a great attitude was there every day"
good,"I was not too thrilled to work here. It was a boring work environment, with a typical set of rules and regulations. I wouldnt reccomend working here to a friend."
good,Wells Fargo is a company for entry level professionals. The training is awesome. The pay not so much. They turn a round is awful. They'll train you and displace you.
good,"The hardest part of the work was navigating between and communicating with the multiple areas of the institution, and trying to find the correct people to talk to, in order to even get started on a given project."
good,Didn’t enjoy it at times. Enjoyed it at other times. The company sees you as a number not a person. But many positions pay well. Very well. Many jobs at Wells Fargo is not for everyone.
good,"There is a lot of opportunity at wells Fargo.  Willing to relocate helps.  I would recommend Wells Fargo to you.  However, they do show favoritism and that can cause advancement issues."
good,Was hired to be a teller and was forced into sales.  The bank pushed it's employees to market every product available to its customers.  Consequences occurred if goals were not met.
good,"Call center pays really well, with a set schedule and very structured work day. Had some good company picnics, and special events, and good incentive. However, branches don't want to pay, has very high standards. Impossible sales goals, long hours and poor management. Only good thing at the branch level was the paid holidays."
good,"It was said to me that a company with an innovation group in inherently not innovative. I wanted to believe that to be false, but there is some truth to it. The spirit of innovation and small, startup grit was in hot pursuit at WF. But the product passion was fleeting with turnover of shorter term contract help and difficult politics of full time employees seemingly focused with securing their own positions."
good,"I moved to FL after a merger closed the PA office, very different culture state to state, took some getting used to but moved on for a better opportunity."
good,"I enjoyed the culture of the company and I loved the customer interactions. However, as seen in the news, there was a lot of pressure made to meet the daily, weekly, monthly and yearly goals to the point where people were threatened their jobs."
good,I took my time at Wells as a learning experience and stepping stone in my career. It taught me a lot of basic operational skills and more about finance. Scheduling was stressful  because management never really worked with what you wanted. Start here and learn then move on. The personal banking positions are not worth the stress for the salaries.
good,So the articles are true. The pushed sales on everyone. The healthcare was good. I learned a ton about finances and home ownership from working in banking. They really don't have any sales goals anymore. We'll see how long that lasts.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Great environment of people. The management was helpful.  The time frame was short unable to judge the overall environment of the company as a whole. A lot of relatives enjoyed it
good,"Difficult to switch industry within company. They are good about hiring within the same part of the company, but it is difficult to switch roles within the company."
good,"Wells Fargo had a small employee benefits team which was overseen by a director who managed all the the local bank's insurance services.  Since Wells Fargo was so large, it was difficult feeling part of such a large entity."
good,"I manage a team of 15 team members for the health care lending sector of Wells Fargo. My team is responsible for the closing, documentation and funding process."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Wells Fargo. The branch i was in maintained an ethical practice even though we where pushed to sell products as if our life depended on it. "
good,"Process transactions ( checks, deposits, money orders , cashier checks) "
good,The company as a whole is very slow paced.  There are multiple levels of approvals for any type of request.  This has become more so after the company was in the paper multiple times for fraudulent practices.
good,"very diverse workplace, fast paced and guideline sensitive."
good,"It's not the company it's the management that need to be trained"
good,"Typical day at work:  Boring and uneventful."
good,"As people read the reviews I think people need to remember each company is unique and we should make our own determination.  We should approach things from a clean slate vs going into something with a predetermined foundation."
good,"Overall the Innovation Group is a great place for a new to mid-level business analyst, product manager or UI/UX designer to cut some chops and learn how to vet ideas into new product development.  There are many of the hottest technologies being used and tested in the Innovation Group and I would highly recommend the team members themselves for being very willing to share and collaborate.  Excellent and talented people in this group at Wells Fago.  However, it is a design-focused and centered group.  Consequently PDM and BA team members will have a tough time being promoted and finding interesting work, while designers will have much more of that."
good,"Before Wachovia Bank NA was acquired by Wells Fargo it was a super family oriented place to work.  Great atmosphere and a wonderful team.  Once Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia, there was not anything regarding the leadership that was even remotely a place to be interested in.  A certain down hill slide."
good,"I was self driven and look into ways to improve my personal skills, knowledge and abilities. I was grateful for the opportunity to learn and develop my management skill sets."
good,"teller duties, nothing too hard however not rewarding either, compensation is minimum. Very sales oriented, sales are pushed hard in retail market,,.."
good,Company strived to have its employees adhear to all Federal and local regulations.  The majority of managers were trying to allow employees to strive to their potential.  Promoted many within the company.  Good work environment and attempted to keep all parties informed of their loans' progress.  Sometimes difficult to transfer to another department.
good,"The beginning was a little off, there was no type of training structure and it was judgement from upper management from the beginning. After training is when the Overtime started. Your job is to review auto loan documents and make sure there aren't any errors prior to funding. Once funded then you will get audited and you must comply with states guidelines and regulations. Not an issue but if you do not complete in a timely manner you either would stay or your name would get passed around about how they are not doing your work. My team was very friendly and enjoyable but for the work that is done, the pay is not enough."
good,"Loved working for the company . Spent years building a solid skillset, now I am looking to move forward. Would refer anyone to work there.  A place that cares for its employees."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,A typical day at work consist of working a pipeline of loans to process for attorneys and courts to make sure the legal documents are accurate. The culture is very diverse and well respected. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people that I work with on a daily basis.
good,Good place to work just not much room for advancement. Can be a calm environment if you keep to yourself and do your job . Not much else to reveal here.
good,The work environment was a bit stressful as a teller but I left because they made a lot of empty promises to me about career advancement and never followed through with any of them.
good,It  was  a  fast   pace 
good,Started off as a good company to work for then quickly went south. All the sales agenda and pressures made it at times unbearable. I'd be interested to see how the company is now after the whole scandal broke.
good,"Start the day with unreasonable goals. If you hit them, they raise it next month. The pay is great, benefits are unbeatable, you get overtime, but is it worth your soul?"
good,On Automatic Dialer entire shift. Comfortable environment. I learned how to give great customer services. Management was not easy to get along with. Diversity in culture. Most hardest part of the job was the competing and trying to stay above or with stats with other co workers. Loved the environment and conformability. incentives
good,"My manager always made time to speak to her team. I miss her, my time was a good run there. WFDS was good to me and my family, I learned a lot there, I worked with some great people."
good,Work culture was good.  Management was lacking.  I didn't feel challenged in the position I was in but overall I like the company. I had worked for Wells Fargo for 14 years about enjoyed the teams I supported.
good,I do not really have an opinion i came in and did the job as expected. With everything going on in the news and lawsuits who knows what is going on with wells fargo and if they are truly for their customers.
good,"Good place to work. Business Excellence Operational Risk Management, Issue management, Corrective Action tracking- Issue resolution. Process mapping. also"
good,The company has become to focused on PRODUCTION and not on quality or the customers' needs.  It was no longer a company for which I enjoyed going to work each day.
good,Good job while it lasted. I would have stayed longer if there had not been pressing personal issues that required me to relocate out of state. If you get a chance to work there do it :
good,I only worked at this job for one year.  I was hired when it was Wachovia Securities and then there was a merger between Wells Fargo and Wachovia and I lost my job.
good,"Pros"
good,Prior to the scandal I worked for a wholly owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo that had a completely separate culture from the bank.  I realize their reputation is bad right now but there are still good people that work there.
good,"Pays well, hard to get full-time hours, no overtime, poor management at times, favoritism, even if you did everything you could to help a customer within your job limits you will still get in trouble if customer complains."
good,I enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo.  Good people.  TEKsystems was a great company that kept me in the loop and made sure I was happy.  My recruiter met with me regularly to ensure things were going smoothly.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Co-workers are very friendly."
good,"Wells Fargo is a good training ground that offers formal training programs and significant deal experience. It is a conservative and structured culture that believes in running a lean shop (e.g. doing more with less = longer than average hours). Overall, people are unhappy at the bank, resulting in much complaining and low moral.  Also, the culture has become very political and people are not the top priority even though the Company's literature may suggest so."
good,"Wells Fargo is an overall good place to work, but does not pay well. They micro manage too much, no team building and when I was there, it was a lot of pressure to open accounts"
good,No review for this company at this time  breaks lunch overtime which you could achieve numerous of ways  that is all I have to say some supervisor were great some not so good
good,"Nice place to work, all the employees looked out for each other as well as management. I will work there again. Unfortunately, our whole department was layed off."
good,"Temporary position placement. Worked for a fortune 500 company doing, data entry. Communication between employees and temp job agency could have been better."
good,We had to review the loans to see if the adjuster made errors with  their calculations. Verified  status of an account. Culture was very professional.
good,"Wells Fargo was strictly an phone based work environment, the typical day there was on the phones attending to customers needs regarding their accounts. the hardest part of the job was sitting with very little time to leave your desk."
good,"Its mostly dealing with customers and loss prevention."
good,I worked with excellent teams. My management supported and encouraged me to pursue more opportunities within Wells Fargo. I would love to work for them full-time.
good,Practiced a very regimented process of all documents that went in and out of this building. The most enjoyable part was working with some great employees and the location
good,I worked at Wells Fargo temporarily in between jobs. It was a great environment to work in. I was able to excel to full-time relatively quickly as well.
good,"This was a temporary position which was productive for me."
good,Wells Fargo offered great training and gave rewards. Enjoyed management and loved the hours. Did not like to see sell sell their products but overall was a great place to work...
good,"Some days would consist of setting up meetings to educate individuals on the Reverse Mortgage product, meeting with at least 1-3 seniors per week. Managing of all mortgage documents needed in order to complete the loan process, etc."
good,it is a good company where you can enjoy their facilities and other amenities. Good management and nice co workers. The shift is night shift and good thing there are shuttles
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I never worked for Wells Fargo directly, I was able to leave before the buyout occurred. I worked for Wachovia, which was a great work environment, as great as a branch could be."
good,Wells Fargo definitely gave me a great start to my banking career. The opportunity for advancement is very hard  because they aren't as focused on career advancement as they are on sales goals
good,wells fargo is a decent company to work for. they have advancements to move up quickly and its decent pay for what you are doing. its a great way to get into banking and financial careers.
good,"Contract/ commission employee"
good,Not a bad job to get into the banking industry but sub-par pay and stressful goals. Only recommend for people new to the industry to get there foot in the door.
good,Fast pace job can get dirty from all the dust and paper. It’s a good starter job and a lot of department you can try to grow.  I got the job by going through temp agency
good,I was a customer service agent. My job was to solve issues related to online banking first and then sell a banking product second. During my duration there the emphasis was on selling first and helping second.
good,Worked through a temp agency as a contract underwriter.  This job required working weekends and late nights due to the high rate of refinances during that period.
good,"the best part about this job was my cubicle neighbors, pot lucks, and sometimes we got to all go outside together on nice days. food at the Jordan creek campus was gross."
good,I found Wells Fargo to be a highly competitive place to work but unfortunately has a downside with poor work/life balance. Wells Fargo has undergone a lot of changes recently due to poor corporate governance.
good,We were given valuable tips on how to work efficiently while doing what was best for the customers.  It was extremely important that we knew banking regulations for the purposes of making decisions on fraud claims.
good,"I have worked there before and did not like the false ""Intergrity of the Company not true to the ""Customers"" and their ""Accounts! Making up accounts!!"
good,Too many internal problems caused by management that team members must take fault for. Worked at a busy location. Made sure they worked you how they see fit.
good,Promise many things and never delivers. While in collage I was promised many thing. One thing I was wanting was advancement opportunities. Would take the required classes but when the time came nothing was ever done. Not even given a chance to interview. it was a waste and they hold people back.
good,it was an okay place to work at but customers and management weigh you down after a while. If you need a job and want full time hours by all means work her but continue looking for a better place to work
good,Technology focused. Friendly environment promotes collaboration and new ideas. Telecommute options in many areas. Work life balance. Benefits less than optimal.
good,"Working with Wells Fargo for almost 14 years and 24 years with the other institutions is always been a very challenging workplace but it gotten worse with the monthly productivity, quality and so time tracker. Feels like human being doesn’t exist anymore. Every minutes is so valuable to get work done in 24 hours with a lots of manual works. Productivity depends on the works you input on the computers"
good,"Make no mistake, bank teller at Wells Fargo is a sale position and you will have daily goal requirements. However, the staff is friendly, and you stay busy so the day goes fast."
good,It was difficult at sometimes. I found my co-workers at the time the reason why I stayed so long. Very good people. The incentives were very good but it was stressful at times.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Meet great people but no time for family. Hours are not the best if you have kids.PTO is available which is great. Still sale goals oriented. Not the best
good,I enjoyed the job as a lead teller but one I became a banker I was unhappy with some of the expectations of the bank. I found there were integrity issues within my branch.
good,There was immense pressure to meet cross selling goals. If you did not offer products you would potentially get written up for poor job performance. Most of the time it was unbearable to deal with the stress.
good,"Working in a branch was often stressful due to high turnover, limited staff and unskilled team members.  Sales goals were aggressive and difficult to achieve."
good,it was okay... but low pay and treats employees bad. my manager was nice but higher management is bad. would not work there ever again that is for sure!
good,"Management could use a lot of help. Benefits are great. Decent work/life balance, and PTO is very generous. Not much team work, very individual, though working towards same goal. Could use some work there."
good,Great benefits and competitive salary. This company continues to go through growing pains. Management pushes employees to work mandatory overtime hours to push goal expectations. Typical large corporate setting where sometimes the left hand doens't know what the right hand is doing.
good,"resolving customer issues and concerns"
good,"Felt pigeon holed in the job, not much room to advance.  Offers a good amount of flexibility.  Small office but people are very nice.  Very heavy workload and not much time to get away from my desk during the day."
good,I was a personal banker at wells fargo for three years. The pay didn't cover the cost of living near it's branches in San Francisco. If it wasnt for that I would have stayed.
good,This was an excellent company to work for they sent me out of town twice to receive extensive training.  All expenses were paid for.  The management was greats.
good,"wells fargo is great at taking care of their employees , the benefits and opportunities. wells fargo is big on recognizing their employees, and planning for the next step"
good,A typical day includes roughly 10-20 interactions with different customers.  The culture of the company is very sales-oriented.  If you don't like to pitch products then this is simply not the company for you.
good,I love what they do there but if you are a temp be ready to have your heart broken as they can let you go at anytime even though you've sign a two years contract with them
good,Wells Fargo is a very large company. Some positions are very competitive and some are not. Wells Fargo uses staffing agency and you cannot deal with Wells Fargo much which is no fun.
good,"You will gain so much experience at Wells Fargo.  It is very fast paced and you will be overloaded with work, so you will have to work quickly and efficiently."
good,Good company. Departments need work and better management. To many crab mentality people along with power driven maangement. But overall they do care about the employees.
good,"I do not have comments on this job cause it as temps."
good,"I worked for at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage for almost two years. The pay was excellent for the location and the age I was at the time while working there. Other than that, I do not wish to comment."
good,Wells Fargo Home Mortgage didn't like to hire people fulltime.  They would put you on a contract for 18 months without a guarantee that you would have a job for the end of that 18 months.  Never made their employees feel that there was any stability.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I liked working there, a place where people with blemished credit can get some help. The hours are okay and they treated me well. I was trasfered out of a depeartment that eventually centralized but would have stayed working there had I had the chance to."
good,Great atmosphere and place to work. Fun people to work with. Fantastic cafeteria on the main floor. Lots of training and team building exercises. Good location.
good,"Standard corporate call center setting, with 40 hour work week. Commission opportunities ranged, but had potential for very large monthly bonuses. Corporate guidelines made many aspects standard/scripted."
good,Wells Fargo is changing.  It is very regulatory driven and trying to figure itself out again.  It is also trying to figure out where to best invest money for growth.
good,The priority of the job was to make customers happy based on their future beneficial needs. Help them with their Financial goals which can help them down the road by providing them the right products and services company was offering.
good,very busy branch in spring where I helped customer in the drive thru and in the lobby. processed deposits and withdrawls assited with issues as well on a daily basis
good,Great Experience Pay not there Management more for the next customer than for the employee. The stress levels on a day by day was very hard for the entire team
good,"It is kind of busy most days at the teller line. What I have learned it to be very careful with all transactions and learn to analyse customer's needs and watch out for scam."
good,the pay is great but the environment is toxic in many branches and the management is poor and inconsistent. the stress of this workplace culture makes the pay almost not worth it
good,It is an extremely fast company that is looking to advance customer's in their financial needs.  It has the opportunity for advancement within the company.
good,helping customers by finding what they need to succeed financially. I learn to listen to cues and clues on daily basis by connecting with the customer on a personal level. Management can be a bit unfair.
good,The branches all had different closing times and that made it difficult for the wellsfargo banking sometimes when people need a certain amount. The managers were very thoughtful to timeoff needed  for their employees and they were not so bad on dress code to where we were looking non professional.
good,"I loved the work, i am a person who is very motivated in any customer service field but tensions became high between my fellow employees. No one got along and it created a very uncomfortable work enviroment."
good,Could not leave your desk to go to restroom .. it wasn't a fun environment to work for them. That's why I left .. every job is different but when your dealing with people money that's a big deal and I wanted to do that best I could.. but it just wasn't for me
good,"I don't want to write a full review on the company. I can no longer live the unknown commission life. With my family situation, I need to be able to rely on a larger base salary than my role provides. At the end of the day, I'm leaving WF due to lack of advancement, and lack of ability to transition to a different department. I also feel that all Big Banks are slow sinking ships."
good,Wells Fargo is a large corporation and has the bureaucracy of a large geographically spread out large corporation.  There are pluses and minuses for working at wells
good,"As starting out I enjoyed my job then there were changes that made the job stressful, We starting cold calling people like telemarketers and also got told when to take breaks, lunch, etc. after putting up with the pointless changes for about 6 months I decided to start looking elsewhere, there were many more factors that went in to me looking for other jobs within WF and outside such as Management, Management plays favorites I would see team members getting special treatment weather it be getting laptops sooner then others or just there manager pushing harder to get them the raise my department gave out to team members. Unfortunately WF is like an adult High School where if your not social or try to be popular you don't get noticed. I would say the only good thing about Wells Fargo is that they hire you with little experience for my job as a Sales Specialist with good benefits and a lot of time off which you need with how this job makes you feel."
good,Company Offers a lot of opportunity but there are many things wrongs with the route to access that opportunity. I don't care to elaborate but while there are a lot of ways and areas to advance.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The culture was good.  Leadership lacked at the local level.  Learned a lot about myself and my leadership style.  I enjoyed watching team members grow and succeed.
good,"I do not have much to say about this company except there are great benefits, and nice 401K. It really depends on the position that you get. It is corporate so if you are coming from a smaller company, prepare yourselves and be willing to adapt to change"
good,Great company to work for.Started with a meeting on goals that needed to met.The hardest part of the job was trying to get in contact with customers that is deliquent.
good,"I liked working here, but they did not make it easy to close loans.  Because of what State I was located in, processing and closing my loans was not a priority."
good,Wells Fargo is a place of employment that encourages all employees to give exceptional customer service while looking for advantages to up sell to a customer or informing them of a new or better solutions to fit their needs.
good,"Sales and Customer service job:"
good,"Wells Fargo is a good place to start a career in Financial Services - advancement will occur but with strong human resources limitations.  The HR function has far too much control over placement, salary, advancement, etc. - those decisions have been taken out of leaders' hands."
good,"You come in at your scheduled time, log on, and begin to take phone calls. You continuously take phone calls until you are scheduled either break or lunch. Once you take these much needed times away from the phone, you must come back and continue to take the same repetitive call over and over again. This is a great job for somebody who doesn't mind sitting at a desk by themselves. There is hardly any human interaction, until you are forced to have a one on one with your work director or your monthly with your supervisor. As long as you follow the rules and do what you're supposed to do, you'll be fine. The pay is very well; however, you must decide between money and your own sanity. Overall, this job is not fulfilling."
good,Good company to work for.  I was able to take online classes that pertained to my job position and was encouraged by manager.  I worked with a great team.
good,"Flexible working hours, fun environment to work. Pay is not great. Have to work on Saturdays sometimes. Locations are very conveninent and candidates will be placed based on proximity preference."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. The culture was morally ambiguous with the way they wanted yu to sell financial instruments. Must admit that I learned more about sales techniques there.
good,"24 call center environment, busy during most hours, very micromanaged and stats are the very important part of job. At times can be high stress due to upset customers and issues are usually related to their bank accounts."
good,"Management encouraged a ""whatever it takes"" approach to gathering units (sales).  This made the customers uncomfortable and the comfort level was equal for the staff.  Managers were dismissed for not hitting high quotas, even with a high customer service rating.  They would be be replaced by younger unethical driven Managers.  Everyone is dispensable, regardless of length of employment."
good,"We set up are existing clients with merchant services. We set up there accounts, and set a (transaction rate) per transaction with the (P.O.S) system that was sold. We send out the merchant equipment, and we gather there article of incorporation and the 501c etc....We work with the bankers to further assist our clients with there accounts. We work with underwriter's for approvals, and or additional paper work that may be needed for authenticity."
good,"It was a stressful, competitive environment that always kept you one your toes, but there wasn't much in the sense of leadership and communication across the boards"
good,It is very busy and sometimes stressful.  There is a lot of politics within the branches and the company. The managers play favorites and cater to the younger employees.  The overall culture is great and the pay and benefits are great as well.
good,a typical day at work is very busy need to learn how to keep calm with the rush because your dealing with money management were awesome at the branch I worked at
good,I really enjoyed my time there. The staff was close nit. The customers were friendly. it was fun to go to work everyday. Some days were stressful but didn't last long.
good,"great place to work, and the people are friendly. this was my second time working for the company. I have no complaints with them. I would recommend it to a friend."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Most of my issues with this employer started after the bad banking practicing issues were made public for Wells Fargo. It bled into my area of business, once the government realized that Wells Fargo's auto lending policies were highly questionable, and created a snowball effect of bad business decisions and reactionary changes to the business model."
good,Get ready to deal with a whole spectrum of customers ranging from penny pinching control freaks to nose stuck in the air customers. I learned that money makes the world go round and that is a complete understatement. Management shifted a lot in my three years there and it gradually went downhill due to favoritism in the workplace. The hardest part of the job is trying to meet product goals without complicating the customer's financial situation. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hours.
good,"A typical day at work was assisting the customers concerns and needs,  I learned patients and answering customers questions. Management was okay.  The workplace culture is friendly and encouraging and motivating.  The hardest part of the job was fulfilling a customers request about fees.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to fulfill their concerns."
good,"I had a typical day with meetings and written assignment. The work place was friendly and comfortable. I didn't have any issues, My job wasn't difficult and the most enjoyable part of work was the work."
good,My time at Wells Fargo was bittersweet. the hourly wages were nice however they constantly changed the comp plan so though my hourly was increasing my annual income decreased every year.
good,there was too much focus on sales and and not customer service.  Do not have flexibility for time off.  Too much bad press associated with that particular bank
good,Every day was about making number while giving good service. at the time the put so much pressure on us to make number that things like customer service and doing whats best for the customer fell to the wayside.
good,The people are very nice and helpful.  As a consultant there was limited opportunity to observe the culture or the management as the project demands took priority.
good,"Benefits are fair, 401k offered as well as stock options. Accepting of cultures, faiths, ethnicities, gender and personal identity. Wages vary from department and management."
good,"During the last year the company has been in the news for fraudulent behavior, and the Federal Reserve has prohibited them from growing for at least the next year.  This has resulted in outsourcing, off-shoring and job reductions."
good,Its a fast pace working environment however pretty laid back. Hardest part of the job is working with customers who are upset. The most enjoyable about my job is when you are able to help out a customer at the end of the day to make sure they are able to be living back in their homes.
good,"I've worked at two different branches: one very fast paced, and only fast for a couple of hours during. "
good,Working at Wells Fargo can be lucrative in certain departments.  Customer Service is just an upsell position and collections sucks.  Ethics arent involved at all
good,"Every day was very stressful and they micromanaged every single second, literally. If i took 3 minutes to go to the bathroom they would come up to me and question why I was off the phone for 3 minutes, then had the audacity to tell me to drink less water so I didn't go as often. After all the talking you as a telephone banker for 8hrs you get thirsty! If you didn't push products to the customers they would get on to you, the customer could have 5 accounts already and they wanted us to push for more, offer pet insurance, tittle loans, credit cards to people who obviously can't mange their checking account."
good,"There is constant pressure to set goal and achieve them. Everyone you work with is seen as competition and there isn't a team atmosphere. "
good,This was my first job as a FA.  They gave me the opportunity to learn.  Unfortunately this was during the financial crisis which had its ups and downs!
good,"Coming to work on time is very important , showing the level of respect for your company and your fellow colleges.  performing your job with the best intentions and quality that you can provide. learning from co-workers is an advantage. And should be two sided. As for management I think an open door policy and transparency is a key to successful and smooth relation ship between Management and employees. Family atmosphere because we all are humans and together and as team is much better for each one at the end. The hardest part of the job is the lack of communications. and being a part of the team and perform well is so enjoyable as being an effective part of the team."
good,this place was a very stressful place to work in all reality. I would nit recommend working here if you do not like working in a fast paced and competitive enviornement..
good,"It was a Very good experience where I learned how to be more detail orientated. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Ok place to work even fun at times.Big on diversity but the pay is not so good.  There is work life balance.  If it wasn't for the pay I would still be there.
good,A dedicated group of professionals working toward excellence for customers and the company.  Education and advancement opportunity.  Work/life balance fantastic.
good,"Es buen ambiente de trabajo, pago de vacaciones completas cuando se es full time, posibilidad de ascenso,"
good,"My co-workers were great. Some of the managers were great, but didn't always manage well. My direct manager related only to her friend in our department, not to the rest of us. Favoritism was shown and reported, but nothing was done."
good,"The workplace is fun though it would be tiring most of the time since calls would come in one after the other.  As they say, working as a phone banker is not for all."
good,Had a bad manager. Company has a bad reputation now.  Pretty basic job. Wasn't hard. I am just going to type because this is pretty annoying.  Wells Fargo was not great.
good,I enjoyed doing the risk assessments but the pace was frantic because the process was not well defined.  I enjoyed my workmates they were helpful. Wanted a little more time to complete work well.
good,"As a tech writer, I was in a strange position. Wells Fargo does not have a culture of documentation. What procedures they have are scattered on sharepoint drives and networks folders. It was difficult to get everything into one place."
good,"The work is not hard, it's how the work is managed and in many cases shifts do not work together which makes it hard on the associates. Need more teamwork."
good,"Great company and great people! Disappointing news impacting employee moral with the sales incentives. It is a very driven environment. They've made strategic realignments. Difficult to penetrate the bubble as there's a clear mark between contractors and ""team members"" which are employees only."
good,Enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo but with the cultural changes being made due to the enormity of scandals they have had they are no longer the performance based company they once were.
good,It is a result driven workplace. Sales goals are constantly the theme of huddles. There is dense pressure to meet sales goals and that can be challenging at times
good,"Don't work there as a contractor unless you absolutely have to... second class citizen if you do.  There was little clear direction to me as a contractor.  Was hired for one thing and then 3 weeks later was doing something more mundane and, to be honest, unbearable.  Everyone but me knew what was going on or so it seemed."
good,took lots of calls helped lots of customers and bankers. got a lot of experience with banking and with customer service. the benefits were good and pay was ok
good,took a lot of calls. helped a lot of customers. busy most times. pretty good benefits gave me a lot of experience in customer service and banking.....
good,"Wells Fargo had a great training program and business suite  of products. Also, they had a great brand. "
good,"If you want to start a career with Wells Fargo and Company, this is definitely the place to start; not only does the management review your performance monthly, but help you create a career path. Lots of room for advancement, fun training, generally positive environment."
good,I was a contractor and did not have full access to the culture
good,big company to work for was an employee for a long time and only left for growth and change and advancement in salary. management was great no issues with how they handled situations
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Company division went out of business, unprofessional, poor management, no room for growth.  Management did not offer good training for positions and showed favoritism"
good,"There are wonderful things about working for an American institution. I have always been proud to work for such a  company, however, my latest experiences with several managers has left my running for the door after more than a decade."
good,it is what it is. Its all about sales. They do not care about you. You are number to them to boost revenue. They do not care about the average customer
good,If you like to give debt and credit to poor collage students and be constantly hounded about sales goals with getting paid very low wages then this is the place for you.
good,"you walked on hot coals, management constantly changing the scope of job or diverging from established processes, they purported everything to be simple when in fact processes were not so simple"
good,"to many hours and no reward, to many lo's fighting for the same biz. constant pressure, pour operations, Managers hands were tied to really help you close loans, to many credit over lays."
good,"With such a large company the experience will have a lot to do with the group. That being said, the company is still recovering from the credit scandal and politics are stressed."
good,work at wells Fargo for 2 years. tarsier from minnesota to california. for promoted after 6 months. management is ok. all about sales. customers are regular........ lunches 30 minutes.
good,"The hours were fairly decent, however it is extremely sells driven. I was one of the lucky ones where my position did not require me to do any sales, however the stress levels of some of the other employees was very apparent. They have made some changes following the scandal in the branches for the better. Perhaps I have this point of view because I am not interested in sales."
good,"Typical US based firm trying to do business in Canada, banging their collective head against a wall while doing as much as possible to do as little as possible."
good,Manager ruined the office and our leads. Never gave us help or flexability on gaining business. He was more worried about micro managing and causing issues with the staff. The office closed.
good,big company lots of managers- lots of meeting - lots of training classes in compliance - lots of desks and chairs - lots of voluntary fund raising - many work evaluations
good,"I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo, the only problem I really had was being laid off and when I went back I had to start over with senority. I enjoyed helping people and learning the mortgage business."
good,Good company culture. Room for advancement. Good benefits. Very slow paced. Boring. Good benefits. Decent schedule. So boring. Collections is not very glamorous. Cool cafeteria with a Starbucks. Desks and computers are old.
good,high paced. demanding. not everyone knows what they are doing. good leadership. work hard to advance. stressful. good place to start out to get a foot in the door
good,Working in the home mortgage field has it perks I learned a lot about purchasing property quoiting rates and that it could change several times a day it was a friendly environment. the most complicated part was making sure to give the correct information with the proper loan there are so many different options when purchasing a home you don't want to make any mistakes.
good,"A typical day would be reviewing my portfolio and come up with an agenda."
good,Like most jobs depends on Management and Supervisors as to the extent of liking or disliking your workplace.  you can like the work/job you are working but the overall company may not be what you anticipated .
good,"never given time off, not any good family hours available for parents, management pocked favorites, heard it was a great place to work outside of collections"
good,I thought myself to be driven and self thought. To teach my employees how to be more in their positions . I have worked here for 9 years and in those 9 years I learned from some of the best managers in the banking industry.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,A decent paying job with no previous work experience in the field required. Strong emphasis on collection and meeting minimum requirements on monthly stats
good,I was part of Wells Fargo when things were in the midst of what you see currently in the news.  Working here is what made me realize all banks are unethical and immoral and are only in the business to make them selves more money rather than take care of their customers.  I always stated to higher ups - take away all commission sales and pay the employees higher and the customer service will go up.
good,Wells Fargo need to hire Managers that will do their job and be managers. The Data Entry Team (weekends) is a disaster. They talk and goof off more than getting the work done. Wells Fargo take on contracts and are not really fully staffed to complete the work at a decent time. They don't pay shift premium for working weekends.
good,"The departments in vicinity are a peach to work with, the work is fine, but the sales teams that reach out from across the country are stressful to interact with."
good,It was a temporary job. It was very easy to learn what they wanted you to do and how. The job was not too stressful and it was not a job that over worked the body.
good,"Wells Fargo benefits were the best part of working for them.  I enjoyed almost 12 years with the company and earned 5 weeks of PTO during my tenure.  Overall I enjoyed working for the company; however, the frequent layoffs have prevented me from entertaining returning to the company."
good,"I loved working for Wells Fargo. I intended to retire from the company. After several international projects and the company funding my legal education, I was not given the opportunity to matriculate into a better position commiserate to my education and experience."
good,"This is a place to work. If you work here, you have a job. There are multiple sites. It employs people here. There are jobs opportunities on their site."
good,It was a fine Summer Internship. I was not promised much but my time there was beneficial and I was compensated well for it. I mostly acted as an assistant.
good,sales environment. it really depends on what department you work. The quality of leads and management vary quite greatly for department to department.
good,"the company shut down my work site, and ,any people were put out of work. They added many task to my job description with out discussing opportunity to increase pay."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company to work for, and the people employees with Wells Fargo are even greater."
good,An adequate work environment.  The pay was typical for any technical writing job of comparable experience.  The work environment was not very stimulating.
good,"Fast paced and dynamic work environment."
good,A productive workplace with a sharing of ideas with colleagues The branch management was supportive and encouraged independence. Though there was favoritism toward the largest partnership in the office.
good,Permanent employees were cynical. There was uneasiness due to the events re: unethical practices in the news. There was little consequences so permanent employees did whatever they wanted.
good,"Wells Fargo overall is a good place to work.  I would recommend working with Wells Fargo.  They have average company perks, average medical, average company discounts and a pretty good work-life balance.  My previous managers were good, but the last manager I had was absolutely immature.  I actually enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo they had good banking perks."
good,The culture is laid back. Wish there was more clear direction from leadership in reference to changes made within the departments. Enjoy my co-workers and they make work life enjoyable.
good,A very secure place to work. do not expect to get rich. 401k was very good while the rest of the benefit were average at best. If you want t advance start young.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,It was a nice place to work. I liked it pays wells. Really very nice. Paid vacations/sick time.  Pushes you to advance..................................
good,Company believes in teamwork and provides a great environment for employees to work. The day is full of many responsibilities and watching the market. Assisting clients with all of their financial needs.
good,"Wells Fargo is a good job to have while still in college. Nevertheless, I did not see much of a future. Therefore, I do not think it is part of a long term plan."
good,My group was a back-office db-management and reporting group compromised of mainly employees with a technological background. The team needed several analysts with both business and tech expertise but did not adequately integrate these business side people in the work needs. Team management did not adequately explain job requirements or responsibilities making success in role for a business-side employee or contractor extremely challenging
good,"Depending upon your manager, WF can be an interesting place to work. Punctuality and clear communication are expected. The workplace has lots of diversity and the atmosphere is both calm and cheery. Commuting via BART can be challenging."
good,"I applied for a customer Service position I was placed in collections, which was an experience. Job was very fast paced and stressful. Overall  I was told I was too customer  service oriented and let go"
good,If you are a type 5 rep. Quality control try there best to make sure you do not receive your bonus. The work environment was very toxic. They believe in favorites.Being the best isn't always a good thing.
good,"I had a great manager, just wasn't the right fit for me.  It has a lot to do with who you know, if you have a lot of relationships with people in the real estate business, you could do really well."
good,"The best part of working for Wells Fargo is your peers. A typical day as a teller includes receiving large amounts of cash, processing multiple transactions, having a positive attitude, and connecting with every customer."
good,Aggressive sales goal and very fast paced but they pay very well for your efforts. That all I have to say about them as a company. Thank You very much
good,I worked for St. Cloud National Bank which was purchased by Wells Fargo. My position was eliminated due to mulitple locations in the area. I cannot effectively rate them as an employee.
good,"Loan processing , learned some of the  legal aspects for lending in each state we dealt with. Culture is honest & ethical. My job is not challenging enough for me. The most enjoyable part of my job is there's no problems to take home, however the pay reflects that too."
good,Great work experience in the loan processing environment of real estate.  You spoke with customers to give them updates almost daily. worked with back end folks to get loans approved and help sovle issues.
good,"It is a good place to work, but has a lot of bottlenecks with management structure. Almost too many managerial roles. Career path is slow and team members are not encouraged to meet socially outside work."
good,i loved working for wells fargo just wish we had a chance to stay with the company. the pay was great benefits were great and i genuinely enjoyed going to work every day
good,Assist customer with questions regarding their mortgage via telephone. I learned about the mortgage servicing  industry. Management was helpful and provided the tools needed to succeed.
good,"Its an ok place to work, there is a lack of overall organization.  Lots of time the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.  But the being able to work remotely is a plus"
good,I worked there for 2 years. The workers were great it was just the company and what they required from us. The goals were set high and employees were never appreciated.
good,At the time the sales goals were unreasonable and stressful to attain. I believe the company has since changed those expectations as other employees felt the same.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I don't know. I don't care about this section. People need to go to glassdoor website and read any employer and employee reviews in relation to overall work life balance, interviews and compensation."
good,"A work place should be a fun place to be at. Management should not be in a bad mood and unfriendly."
good,Assists patients with their accounts.  Cash checks.  Make deposits.  Help with business accounts.  Closed accounts. Help to resolve any account problems.
good,I lost my grandmother and requested time off while employed here and felt left out to dry when I wasn't able to return in the time frame they expected.
good,Fast paced. enjoyed the employees that I worked with. Hated working almost all the holidays in my line of business when the rest of the bank were closed
good,This company is good to start a career with but you will have to eventually move on. The promotions are all within house and its really a popularity contest. You may not know much about the job or the best candidate but if you know the hiring manager then you have a good shot of moving up. The work is very stressful and the demands of perfection is expected with no errors. There is constant change with no stability at all. The company goes one direction then will go a different direction in a couple of weeks.
good,I was a temporary contractor and BOA and never got fully engaged with the team so I cannot comment on what the environment is like and what it is like to be a full time employee
good,"High pressure sales environment, high turnover employees. Good benefits overall. Nice place to work if not dealing with customers or sales department. Tough to move around to high paying jobs and sometimes managers can be micromanaging."
good,"It was hard to overcome negative press, no matter if I beat the offer on the table or if I did my job perfectly. My pre-approvals were looked down upon by the realtor, even if the customer was a Wells Fargo customer."
good,A typical day at work would consist of me calling out to customers who have inquired online about getting a mortgage. I have learned a ton of info on getting a mortgage. Management could have been a lot better in some areas. The culture consisted of people ages 19-50. The hardest part of the job is trying to calm down people who are upset about getting a call. The most enjoyable is being able to successfully help customers obtain a mortgage with us.
good,"The team you are working for determines if the work experience will be good or bad. Some teams are fun and exciting to be a part of. While on others, work is just more challenging partly because of the load and partly because of the team process."
good,The culture created by the company conditional to the sales  your drove thru your business unit.  They cared more about the numbers than the people who worked there.
good,"a typical day at work, it was  an okay joy did not like trying to get customers to open extra accounts or saving.  It was suppose to be a referral job but it was really a selling job that required you to sell"
good,It is a great place to start your career and learn new skills and will have to do all kind of different tasks that will develop your skills depending how much you want to learn. It really depends on the culture of your management.
good,Good place to start out and gain experience but Once you are in you will probably want to leave soon thereafter. With the dropping of sales goals (however long that lasts?) I guess the retail jobs would be easier... but boring.
good,"I had this job quite a while ago, through a temp agency. It was fine for what it was. Basically just clerical work, but the environment was professional"
good,Management is terrible. The district I worked in had a ton of manipulative managers. The company sells an image of caring. However my MGMT staff did not. They lie to and manipulate employees by dangling raises and promotions for sales goals. If you are a top producer your manager will never let you move forward because they need your sales numbers. The maximum pay increase when promoted is 10 percent.
good,"Though not there long I found the experience and training to be rewarding.  I was particularly fond of my manager who inspired a ""can-do"" attitude through unwavering support and great product knowledge."
good,Wells Fargo was temporary for me. They could improve in areas as well as other banking organizations. I really didn't care for being in a banking environment. Wells Fargo's pay is  good.
good,this was a good transition point from a lower management roll to something a little more grown up! learned a lot... developed some life long networking from this place.
