rating,review
bad,worst experience of my life. I would never recommend anyone to this environment. it is dog-eat-dog there and everyone throw everyone under the bus just to servive
bad,"Leaders are a bunch of micro managers who make independent policy separate from the company. Way 2 many mgrs and regional mgrs. Hire experience Biotech reps and you don't need 1 mgr for 8 reps, thats a waste of money."
bad,Substandard - Poor - Abismal - Dark - No Room For Growth - No Management Support - No Technology Targets Provided - No Way To Excel In A Career - BAD CHOICE ALL THE WAY AROUND!!!
bad,"Everyone here is contract, lay offs are frequent, managers don't care to know your name, not accommodating or flexible in any sort.  Everyone here seems nervous and unhappy."
bad,"Didnt like this job at all.  They were not professional.  Didnt care about staff, no training it was all in a book an put on a employee to understand alone."
bad,"Current C Unit is more prior aut/reimbursement oriented than an actual Sales or Marketing job."
bad,"I would not recommend the position I held, in the particular department where I worked, to anyone.  There are other great departments and employees in other areas of Amgen."
bad,"This is a very bad place to work for due to very unstable and unsecure company. Not sure if it is out of business, very disorganized, management is absent most of the time and they only look at end numbers."
bad,"Middle Management is a complete disaster!  They are obsessed with themselves and their careers and will do anything to get ahead except support you.  If you are looking for leadership and mentoring or guidance from your manager look for a different employer because that is not what is expected of the managers.  And this is not just HR it is all departments, at least in Tampa.  They are merely task masters and paper pushers down to the lowest level employee who are then told to ""Figure it out.  Good luck with that.  I'm leaving early for the day.  Be sure it gets done before you leave."""
bad,"This place did not give me a legitimate chance. It was a nightmare! I was with a contracting company to work in the QC lab. The people who were training me were rude and obnoxious. The company loaded the wrong training documents and they thought it was my fault. When learning the testing methods, the laboratory staff said they were too busy to train and told me I had to learn them on my own. When I had problems or questions, nobody would help. They only gave me one chance to pass training requirements and rushed the procedures. I tried explaining to the contracting company about the problems but they threw me under bus. The company management and staff have a personal bias on who they want to work there! The contracting company gave me a separation letter that was personally insulting and inflammatory! It is said the company is the best place to work in RI but I totally disagree."
bad,"My understanding is that they were well respected in the community and have made many breakthrough's in bio pharmaceuticals.  Their employees had amazing benefits and 401k, a great campus and work life balance.  In the last few years, that has all changed.  They turned into the worst company I've ever worked for.  They have an unsustainable business model.  A few years back they fired a large population of their employees and hired them back under various contractor positions spread out amongst several recruiting firms.  Some of these employees had a drop in pay and lost benefits while others lost their jobs.  Many of those employees are bitter, it's not widely discussed but there's a sense of resentment and that reflects heavily on the workplace culture. "
bad,"Poor leadership, lacking a solid direction with the in-depth product sales utilizing specialty pharmacy  and multiple internal and external resources for pull through.  Constant Compliance issues and investigations.  Low morale!"
bad,Management has little vision and  will always feel like you will be laid off. Dog eat dog corp environment. Only care about quarterly earnings. Terrible employer!
bad,"To whom wish to work for Amgen,"
bad,"Contracted in the Woburn, MA facility for two nightmarish months. I was told they had an open ear and welcome new ideas. Not even close. The safety dbag watched over everything you did just to tell you to do it different. Hardcore FDA regulated. Employees are told to fill out reports and ""dime-drop"" on others if they see you do something wrong. You'll be better off joining the army. It's run just like that. Big turnover and a lot of firings. Stay far away from this asylum."
bad,"Beautiful campus and a lot of friendly and smart coworkers. However, there is no job stability, everyone is always looking over their shoulders and praying that they will still have jobs. Amgen hires a third party company to determine layoffs and they do not value talent. "
bad,"My experience at Amgen was to say the least, unprofessional. The particular manager in the department that I worked in was inexperienced in being a lead person and unable to manage a team. Other departments may be run differently but my personal experience was horrible."
bad,"Naively, I thought that the company with such a history/reputation would be a great place to work, even as a contract worker. BIG MISTAKE. Not sure if it was only my department, but the place is utterly dysfunctional. Don't bother taking Amgen's company value training - fake. Management only cares about their own perception at the higher level. Work is boring and to be honest does not bring much value. It seems entire departments exists there for a sake of existence with no real purpose behind them, and the people on top will do everything to keep fake status quo running. I thought the systems/organizations/procedures would be superior taking into account size and complexity of the organization - nothing of this kind, didn't learn anything. Contractors coming and going like crazy, management in constant move, there is no sense of direction, future prospects, mission. You can encounter a lot of dishonest and bad, but politically savvy people, who are sure to succeed. The rest is thrown in a in/out mill."
bad,"When I joined the company was unlike any other I've worked for or consulted for in my career.  The place was almost magical in how the teams pulled together and worked to make products to improve people's lives.  Then - the organization morphed almost overnight into a cost cutting, outsourcing, big pharma company where shareholder value trumped solid business sense. After being valued for so many years employees became just another cell in a cost analysis spreadsheet and treated as such.  Not a good place to work as you will be treated as a resource in the truest sense of the word - something to be used up until depleted."
bad,"Amgen relies heavily on contract workers. They fire people willy-nilly (employees and contractors alike), so everyone is on edge and ready to throw coworkers  under the bus to save their own neck. If you'll notice, the best thing anyone has so say about the company is the beautiful campus."
bad,"Growing, well funded, well established company is being ruined by a toxic corporate atmosphere and culture. I had too many bosses and too many hurdles thrown in my way to get anything constructive done."
bad,"When you work with Amgen you are treated like a number not a person."
bad,"Ambiente super tranquilo ,colegas de trabalho muito prestativo, o único defeito era a sala onde trabalhava, não era muito limpa, fedia a mofo, sem circulação de ar, e o ar condicionado era precário,a sala era pequena para a quantidade de pessoas, a sala para fazer as refeições não cabia todo mundo."
bad,"Lots of people in my department were brought in through staffing agencies and don't have health insurance, a retirement plan, or even vacation or sick pay. We have to take tons of unpaid time off during the year for company shutdowns. (Including two weeks at the end of the year. Merry Christmas to you, too, Amgen!) We basically have the same job functions and are expected to work as hard as regular employees, but are treated as second class citizens in every other sense. They subtly dangle the carrot in front of you that you might get hired at the end of your multiyear contract. It hardly ever happens these days, and they will just replace you with a new temp. Oh, and you will be expected to put a smile on your face and train your replacement before you go."
bad,The drug products are important to people's lives.  There is a real need for the products and the company stresses a real sense of urgency to produce the products.
bad,"Poor management with no vision on the field you are working on. A huge waste of company resource and money, while those managers continues getting rewarded and promotions based on anything else except performance. Using political power to attack people with different opinions. Low moral values and be prepared to be challenged for your moral bottom line, like lying and slanders. Very hostile working environment to a decent person if you are more capable than your manager/colleagues and willing to do something. No respect to people and career opportunities are only given to people depending on who you know. Both physical and huge mental tortures are not worthy of your hard work and contributions. Try to avoid as much as possible."
bad,"I've been working in pharma for 20+ years for various Fortune 500 Global Pharmaceutical companies.  Amgen seemed like a lucrative opportunity at first, but once I was there, I realized it was a big mistake."
bad,"If you're seeking a career where you can truly make a difference in the lives of others, where you can work at the forefront of biotechnology with the top minds in the field, you'll find it at Amgen."
bad,"Good pay, benefits, and if you get a good manager, good balance.  High stress environment, you are a number, not a person, and totally expendable.  There is no relationship between your contributions and how you help the company advance and your job security.  It used to be a really great place to work but over the years the benefits have steadily declined.  I enjoy my job and the people I work with a lot, but decisions are made by senior management that are not even local and don't know us and clearly don't care about us and our lives.  Decisions are not thought out well, but seem spontaneous and ill-conceived - almost made on a whim.  Very volatile work place as far as job security."
bad,Management needs improvement i was asked to lead a group only to find  out management never informed the group I was asked to lead.... co workers will pretend to be your friend but actually are gathering information  to betray you ....be aware....     paid is great ...benefits are great but the culture is barbaric
bad,"The work done was never enough.  They always wanted to               ""do more with less"".  And while there was room for advancement the culture was like that everywhere."
bad,"The work was incredibly interesting!  My co-workers (regular Amgen employees) were very willing to share information and teach me the processes related to the campaign (Prolia) we were working on.  They also told me how the company used to have picnics and many perks for the staff until~~~the BIG LAYOFF.  I even worked extra shifts/overtime to support the program then, became seriously sick/in ICU during Christmas shut down.  My contract was initially extended for 6 months then, the day before Christmas it was suddenly canceled.  My direct supervisor did not even know I had been terminated. Later, all I got was ""The Great Wall of Silence"".  During my tenure, I repeatedly applied for ""regular"" full time positions as they became available but, it seemed that I was never really considered.  Be very wary of Amgen~~"
bad,Amgen contributes more money to political campaigns to keep drug prices high than any other biotech company which is a practice that I find unethical.
bad,"Ho avuto la conferma che, come per gran parte delle farmaceutiche, si entra solo per raccomandazioni, almeno per i ruoli amministrativi. Mi è proprio stato detto in faccia. Altro che Great place to work! certo, per chi conosce qualcuno dentro che ti dà la classica spintarella....delusione massima"
bad,Communication is very poor as well as management. People are very quick to blame others for any issues. Co-workers are good people but a lot of negativity. The most enjoyable part of the job is when it is time to punch out.
bad,"Gelokt vanwege mijn werkervaring en opleiding (Vapro C) om het niveau van de productiemedewerkers te verhogen en dat ik snel kon doorgroeien naar een leidinggevende functie, echter is hier weinig van terecht gekomen en heb ik Amgen verlaten."
bad,"Assedio moral intenso, pressão desmedida e falta de cultura de comunicação corporativa."
bad,Select your friends wisely.  Choose the principal scientists and executive to protect your back. Be their own eyes in the departments and report every little details about  your coworkers.  You know they need you specially with few of them have no knowledge of science to begin with
bad,Sales operations team consistently proved incapable of reliability or understanding of the need to provide accurate and timely information with out any sense of accountability.
bad,"New managers with no experience managing people. "
bad,Amgen was a dissapointment. I have a lot of experience in biotech sales and Amgen did not harness talent like it could or should. The management team was fair at best.
bad,"There was so much hope coming to this organization, but became very jaded quickly with constant competition and CYA."
bad,Poor communication to staff and contractors. Generally great people on the Dun Laoghaire and Santry Sales Office.
bad,...with very little trust or distribution to other sites.... no real leadership and no skin in the game feeling from sr management spending more of their time protecting their own interests and kingdoms rather than their teams and their motivation
bad,"Don’t value staff plays games no direction. Figure it out on your own"
bad,Most employees do not enjoy their position. Really dependent on the person you work for but leadership at the top needs to change. I would not recommend working at AMGEN
bad,"This place had such incredible potential.  But now because they wasted so much time, resources and money on research that went nowhere, they've let go of so many good people that half the building on their campus are now empty (so I hear)."
bad,"I was a contractor - no benefits."
bad,This company is full of confusion and insecurity. It is surprising that a $22 Billion organization has been running without a CIO for many years. Hiring and firing is the order of the day. Highly insecure place where there no job security. It was a excellent organization in the past but no more. Chaos prevails the moment the stock fluctuates. Lethargic and poor decision making at the top. Silo working style no cohesiveness within the organization.
bad,"lots of favoritism, if you don't have a college degree eventually you will be gone,all work going overseas,other than those things they pay well"
bad,"Excellent benefits and great products, however the management and on-the-job training are a joke. You are a disposable asset with little to no personal development provided."
bad,Firma el değiştirdikten sonra tüm sosyal koşullarda negatif yönde gelişmeler yaşanmıştır.
bad,"my experience included mixed messages, lack of clear direction, zero trust, micromanagers, hierarchy, and unsupportive colleagues; there were so many people out on disability i never understood why HR didn't track it and realize there was a problem"
bad,N/A really don’t have a comment good company history. Depends on the job your taking and the employees that work with you. Make sure you fully understand the role and expectations of the job.
bad,"Amgen is living on bare-bones in terms of people and outside dollars expenses.  But they expect you to do things well, complete things on an unrealistic timeline, and keep doing it, project after project.  The triple constraint of time, cost, and quality doesn't exist there... because Amgen knows that people have the ability to flex and work harder when asked.   So if you're OK with working harder and smarter, then hey, it's awesome."
bad,Not all people should be a manger just because they have a certain title or job level. Certain people are treated fairly while others are not. I work as a administrative coordinator and certain people in this role are treated poorly.
bad,"Stuck to the computer mostly working by yourself since the work environment is very computerized. New staff are expected to learn on their own. If you don't have friends, it will be tough. I have been there 2 1/2 years still don't have friends I would want to go happy hours with. I personally think some buildings have racially biased management or rather friends only promoted. Most lower level employees are all races while 95% of management are white!"
bad,"Unstable, bad manager culture, lacking research direction, often overtime, very stressful"
bad,"Recent budget cuts, restructuring, and changes to business environment (transition from offices/cubicles to 'shared' work space) has caused dramatic work culture changes and contributed to anxiety and uncertainty among staff. Concurrent business system changes along with culture changes further complicate day to day business operations. Common feeling among staff questioning the direction the company is going and if actions have been thoroughly thought thru prior to roll out. Previous work culture which was in place emphasizing work life balance and encouraging staff to be comfortable and happy in their roles is fading out and being replaced by constant uncertainty and job insecurity."
bad,"Amgen Culture was good to begin with, but there was a change. There are times when people feel they are walking on egg shells. Can be stressful at times."
bad,I learned a lot about science at Amgen. I learned the importance of clinical trials and how many people lives are changed when they have a medication for a disease that didn't have one before. I also learned to not like corporate America while working at Amgen
bad,"Since 2007, a typical work day in research and development involved balancing a very large workload and backlog of work, under rigorous timelines with little wiggle room for accommodating routine personal life issues.  Concomitant with a decrease in company earnings, frequent reorganizations of the company and various departments changed the culture, such that the motto became the proverbial creed of ""you're lucky to have a job"".  Coupled with a poor capital budget, the ""innovate or dye"" mantra of the RnD leadership created a stressful work environment since people were expected to do more with less. Paradoxically, the overall morale was very poor for such an awesome staff since co-workers tended to be very bright, friendly, and hard working people that performed well in a fast paced complicated team environment."
bad,"Performed a dual role as a Business Systems Analyst and Developer to provide automation solutions for domestically and global clinical trials using SQL, MS Access, VBA and VB Script."
bad,A lot of people are leaving to secure positions with competitors of Amgen because management blatantly lies with regard to the performance of there employees.  Leadership at the executive level largely under minds employee productivity.  This applies to the cardiovascular division.
bad,It would be a great place to work if it wasn't for the constant organizational changes and layoffs. Entirely unstable work environment makes for a stress full workplace
bad,Everyone was laid off at Longmont Colorado's Amgen Facility.
bad,"A typical day at work can range from incredibly busy to dull. Depending on leadership, advancement is nearly impossible. Managing work/life balance is incredibly difficult and flexibility is preached but not really practiced. Amgen has become more of a pit stop for talent than a career company. Outsourcing is increasing at an incredible rate."
bad,"too many changes with very little direction"
bad,The foundation of a great R&D organization that has been undermined by CEO whose only real concern is keeping up appearances and stock price.
bad,"Amgen is a great client, but unfortunately TMS Health is the employer."
bad,"It used to be a great company, now everything is outsourced and it is always restructuring so there are constant layoffs. Career advancement is very slow."
bad,"The pay is good, they ride you like a dog,they dont care what you have to say they just will get somebody else and you can leave, high turn over rate"
bad,When I was a contracted employee Amgen was great. After I was hired it was totally different than what I was presented. Everyone there is depressed and complaining. Lack of communication between management and employees.
bad,"Busy most of the time. Great co-workers, great place to work. Enjoyed working for many years until laid off."
bad,"My boss is amazing and encouraging. The work environment is very political and there is some racial bias. Located in a great area if you metro, but parking is expensive,"
bad,"Poor management in the legal department 10 years ago. "
bad,"Now an Expedia cube-farm, Amgen moved operations over to Singapore, China and back down to Thousand Oaks leaving hundreds of scientist and associates who did amazing work moving or asked to leave the company. The facility was built for Immunex, Amgen acquired Immunex and in 2014, in about 10 years, they closed it."
bad,"a lot of good employees had left Amgen since the big changes  had happened on early 2014 restructure.  "
bad,"Enjoyed many years at Amgen. Some great people. Some not so great. The company changed greatly while I was there - from a large company that still functioned like a small one, where employees were respected & treated well - to a large company run by finance people where only the bottom line mattered. If you stay too long, and you're not in a revenue-generating department (sales or marketing), they'll find a reason to get rid of you. But until that happens, it can be a great place to work."
bad,work overtime. Learned other positions in compant. Good. Working weekedns. Free food.
good,No es un trabajo estable ya que muchas ocasiones no hay trabajo y uno llega al area de trabajo y es cuando uno se entera que no hay trabajo. Aun asi los supervisores son flexibles.
good,"This was a very interesting position. It was not a great fit for me."
good,"Co-workers here are great. What kills it is the poor/last minute decision making from management that requires employees to often alter their personal schedule to accommodate company needs, which leads to employees being stressed a lot of the time."
good,"Poor management and poor manager really send people run away from Merck. The new manager is extremely stupid, very rude and pretends to be smart everyday."
good,I've experienced a very unorganized department in which the managers and leadership are never actively engaged in their departments. I've never seen so many people who are always in Meetings.
good,"Location Closed. Product did not pas trials and Amgen is reducing its physical footprint by 25%, which means the US locations are suffering."
good,"job was good but the management were very unhelpful. was promised a lot of benefits such as safe pass,full time hours, then to be made redundant after 30 days along with a few others who i started with"
good,DH&I has gone through multiple upper management changes in a very short time. Each change in upper management results in a major reorganization of all of DH&I.
good,"So saddened by the recent shift in culture.  Amgen is being more and more  influenced by big pharma and looking for ways to act as big brother, looking over reps.  On the horizon:  Full time VPN on devices, telematics in company vehicles.  Mismanagement of products.  Poor brand teams and managed market teams will spell doom for Amgen and it's reps moving forward."
good,"Highly in-experienced management, no one can make a decision.  Tons of meetings with no direction."
good,Amgen produces a lot of  documentation thinking that it makes the product better. They are good at producing paper for the FDA  Their focus is drugs. They farm out device development.
good,"Good for experience and bank account. High turnover rate for a reason.  Consider other offers for longevity. Management is a mess, constant turnover, does provide buy/bill training, and injectable experience."
good,"If another company comes in and undercuts the current contractor,you, no matter how stupid the decision is; will be replaced. It is 100% about money no matter what ANY company tries to tell you."
good,Fast paced company with dynamic facility capability for multiple products.  Disposables technology to enable high throughput and minimal utility cost.
good,"Disappointing launch of Corlanor.  Fortunate enough to do well with the products however, the way leadership treated my counterparts who were not so fortunate with Corlanor after the messy launch is shameful.  Not a place I would encourage for the faint of heart.  Dog eat dog culture.  The launch of Repatha was even worse and they should have this specialty pharmacy game down to a science since they are not new to the biologics game.  Work life balance is non existent if you do not want to be on a list for not making your weekly numbers.  I am fortunate enough to have a great manager, however, nationally, my counterparts are miserable and get harassed every day regarding their numbers.  Our team is frightened of what will happen when our manager gets promoted and we get the tried and true Amgen manager that runs their teams on fear and intimidation."
good,From the first day I started I was in a very negative environment.  There was no team attitude at all.  It was every man for himself with people talking behind everyone's back and no direction at all from management.  The training was extremely poor   I would never want to work under the same management again.
good,"Amgen is a great company to work for, depending on the area and department. Some areas are better than others, some departments are better than others. Do your own due diligence and research before accepting a position."
good,"Amgen was transitioning to a more structured large corporate culture.  One of the most common things I heard there was: ""how much better it was back in the day"".  "
good,"Worked for two years as a Contractor. I worked in collaboration with three other attorneys hired to audit 10,000 contracts and 20,000 purchase orders for compliance with current HIPPA laws."
good,"Take the job if offered but beware of the broken culture and arrogance amongst leadership that is staggering. The values hang on the wall so that should be enough to warn you. For me, Amgen is one big disappointment. There is a disconnect between the stated values and the experience you will have as an employee. I do feel for those who are longtime employees at Amgen as they have come to believe that the kind of mistreatment is just par for the course. They seem to hang on to fond memories of what it used to be. Also, repeated reorganization and RIFs have broken the spirit of those that have remained. It is a beautiful campus including a variety of cafeterias, an onsite premium gym, soccer field, etc. As you walk about the campus, you'll see that most of the FTEs are stressed and bored while the contractors are constantly coming and going. As of late, there is a stream of talented and bright minds walking out the door in frustration."
good,"Uma grande estrutura, com pouca tradição no País que ainda não encontrou seu lugar no mercado, consequentemente demissões em grande nro, são frequêntes."
good,"NextGen workspace no longer assigned desks or monitors available to all who need them.  Due to constant remodeling, eateries have closef and food trucks brought in, exceedingly expensive."
good,Great company for helping people's lives.  Great Campus and very nice people I got to meet. This is a company I  would consider to be one of the best in research and development area.
good,Intermitancia gerencial. Politicas no bien definidas. Exigencia de rentabilidad muy alta para la observada en el mercado
good,"For certain departments, politics play too much of a role in a majority of the decisions. We trying to develop therapeutics to save lives. The science should be more important than the politics when making scientific decisions"
good,"It is an excellent company with respect to compensation,  and seem to look after permanent staff well,  the difficulty relates to contact positions,  there seems to be no feedback whatsoever either positive or negative,  and there is an extraordinary blame culture. I'd recommend it as a stepping stone rather than a long term career prospect."
good,"close to home , very nice to work except for a few of the Amgen employeees . Some thought that they were great and they have a habit of treating outsiders(contracters) very poorly or look down upon them ."
good,"Manage on time deliveries"
good,This is a good company but the management can be very challenging. The benefits that they provide at this company are substantial but they definitely overwhelm you with amount of work and the stress they put their employees through.
good,"Amgen is a high impact sales company.  The company could have done a better job on territory alignments before hiring a new sales force.  I learned a lot on the Buy and Bill, Specialty Pharmacy, and Retail process for a biologic."
good,"Amgen is a great place if you are actually hired to work there as full time employee and not as a temp. They made us temps feel like we didn't matter. They excluded us from all company events, including christmas parties. The campus is pretty and 7 really nice gourmet cafeterias, but you don't get the experience unless you are a full time, til then you are just a minion."
good,"Amgen has great benefits and pay with many opportunities to grow and learn in a fast paced environment.  The Thousand Oaks campus is very large with many extracurricular activities to get involved with. They boast amazing events such as their annual chili cook-off along with several other festivals.  They offer lunchtime leagues such as basketball, soccer, football Frisbee, and more.  There is a fantastic gym and don't forget that Amgen host the Tour of California each year.   Amgen shutdown twice each year (Winter and Summer) which you will wonder how you ever got along without it. "
good,"Great people with a lot of knowledge. Typical day at work, check email, perform routine water collection and EM, BIO's endo's plate reads, biohazard disposal, in operation support. The hardest part of the job was not having a second shift and having to come to support manufacturing in the middle of the night."
good,"The work environment is very isolated, I was put in a small office underground and almost all communication was done through emails, even with coworkers that had offices next door. Everything had to be recorded as a ""meeting"" and there was so much micromanaging that 20% of the work day was recording the days work, and the entire process was inefficient."
good,"Great benefits, compensation and good place to work however workalike balance is not that great also job security is a bit concern due to contact changes."
good,"The culture at Amgen is very competitive, with favoritism shown to those who buddy up to management.  Individuals who do well in office politics are given more opportunity for advancement than those who master their jobs, particularly in the scientific roles.  Medical benefits are above average, as are savings plans for retirement.  Many layoffs have occurred over the last ten years, with staff being replaced by contractors.  Some benefits have declined in recent years, such as tuition reimbursement, which went from 100% to a flat $5K per year.  Child day care is available but is very expensive.  Cost-cutting since the 2008 economic crisis has negatively impacted the working environment and the company culture."
good,The company looks nice to an outsider but management culture is very protective of an out of control quality system and does not invite new process improvement ideas!
good,"Relaxed work environment, own initiatives are fostered and encouraged."
good,"Uncertain times at Amgen."
good,"Amgen employs a lot of very smart people.  They also throw a lot of work at you and don't often replace people that leave.  The benefits are good, but work life balance isn't great and something you have to fight for. Open office environment and private booths are hard to find empty."
good,"Associate Supply Chain at Amgen:"
good,"While not all of the management at Amgen is bad, there are some senior managers that are disconnected, authoritarian, and motivated only by their personal gain. The general culture has become one of fear and retribution instead of security and learning."
good,"I stayed for the pay and the belief good employees are valuable. "
good,"Regulatory Affairs department is stressful, cut-throat, and competitive. Multiple lay-off in recent years made people worry about their jobs all the time. A lot of CYA, people get blamed easily for mistakes. The culture is often times secretive. "
good,"I was able to advance from an Administrative Assistant to and Associate over the course of the 14 years I worked there prior to my retirement.,  Some supervisors were wonderful, some were difficult to work with.  I was very ready to retire in 2014."
good,"Gelokt om snel te kunnen doorgroeien en met mijn Vapro C diploma en het nivo van de productie omhoog te brengen."
good,Business model is changing.  This is resulting in uncertainty and low employee morale.  Constant project re-prioritization greatly hampers any long-term project planning.
good,"High impact work"
good,Amgen is a great company but too many fiefdoms undermine its goals. The company tries to create this illusion of a tight-knit familial environment but it is ultimately  stifling and counter-productive.
good,"Great place to work although not everyone is friendly."
good,"Good company but some managers are not very good, overall good employee benefits but some basic things are missing. It has good products in the pipeline."
good,"Good company but worked as a contractor for 2 years and no opportunity for advancement. It's difficult to obtain a regular position because it's not what you know, but who you know that gets you the job. Contractors compete against each other in hopes of securing a regular position."
good,"Amgen has a good pipeline, decent pay and benefits.  It has gone from being a innovative biotech to feeling more like big pharma.  Not bad... Just different.  You will work hard and a good amount of hours.  However, don't expect to get promoted internally.  The company has flattened considerably and will recruit leadership externally.  Many colleagues have left for career advancement."
good,"Amgen worker productivity seems to be diminished, and its culture appears to be conditioned by constant large-scale initiatives driven top-down.  Teams' ability to execute is impacted by a culture of job-protectiveness, and even excellent and essential ideas are delayed for years waiting for various reorganizations.  In a nutshell, Amgen does not foster ideation, invention, creativity; further, the company seems to reward passive-aggressive behavior."
good,"Company needs to retain talent, poor middle management, lots of type A personality that fights for no reason, needs to improve HR"
good,"Generalist procurement manager - no typical day."
good,"Manage multiple representatives, meet with customers, coach, focus on sale goal attainment, assist customers with clinical and access information pertaining to product mix ."
good,"Was fun job, lots of learning was still learning. Contract ended."
good,"A typical day at work consists of scheduling meetings, managing conflicts and fitting all meetings into schedules in timely fashion, determining priority and working with others to try and get key attendees at the prioritized meetings.  Attendance of these meetings and taking notes is an important part, capturing action items, assignments of these action items and deadlines as to when they should be completed.  Logistics assigned to these action items may consist of travel, which I would schedule, further meetings, obtaining other key players from other business units or companies.  Building these relationships is an important part of my role, being the point person for projects and making sure they stay on schedule.  Constant follow up and project tracking is what keeps tasks on schedule.  Using my vast computer skills to speed up tasks and keep all projects on track is most helpful.  The hardest part of this job can be the constant follow up and ensuring that others are on task in timely manners.  The most enjoyable part is also the interaction with others and the success of a project that we complete as a team.  Taking ownership and acknowledging both failures and wins can be obviously both enjoyable and difficult.  By the end of the day, having done the best of my ability is what makes the day a success."
good,"Very heavy and ambiguous management, the senior management changes strategies so frequently that the organization lacks behind and i cause chaos all over."
good,The work assignment as a Manufacturing Program Specialist allowed me to acquire tools and skills to conduct a thorough investigation of non-conformance events during the manufacturing process.
good,"Nice company to work for, however there are areas that need some major management and leadership changes. The workplace culture is pretty good. The hardest part of the job is just repeating the same old thing without making changes."
good,"I was not very pleased with my time at Amgen. High turnover and poor management decisions were consistently a problem. In the end, they ended up moving all of discovery research back to Thousand Oaks, CA. Workplace culture was not the best I've worked in by any means."
good,"Lots of nepotism with hiring managers. Instead of promoting from within, they bring in their buddies from the outside under the radar. The individuals never went through the interview process and as a contractor I had 7 interviews, told the position was mine, and then the manager introduced his buddy in the position who was not as qualified."
good,"Good place for research, materials and technology are made available"
good,"There are few places better to invest your career time than in Biotech."
good,"Lack of a visible on-going senior management presence which allowed for lack of significant on-going progress and clear identification of enterprise-wise goals and director-level synchronization.  Need for integration of lower level staff capabilities and skills and less reliance on contractor management in lieu of action from director-level staff.  Way too many meetings with no clear advancement of organizational objectives. Lots of waste here of human and organizational resources, including the allowance of dysfunctional workplace behaviors to continue with promotions and continued tenure despite notification to human resources."
good,"If you want to work and can get into Amgen, you will be rewarded with many benefits.  The huge draw-back is that nobody feels confident about their job security, so everyone is fighting to get ahead.  Management is weak, put into place by higher level VPs that don't want changes from below- everything should be pushed from the top ( which works very poorly and leads to more work for all involved).  Overall, if you can put up with the infighting, the lack of motivation, and now the open seating concept, you could do very well at Amgen."
good,Great place to work if your under the right management. Alot of politics at this company. Stress level high! Great benefits over all.The workload is a lot and you either sink or swim. Need a better training program.
good,"Learnt GMP, working with FDA regulated drug product. did assay development, qualification and validation. documentation and CRO management. very strong management culture"
good,"After working in a smaller innovative biotech company for 9 years, the experience at Amgen was rather disappointing.  It was difficult to pursue innovative thinking as the company was very risk adverse.  As with most large companies, change was difficult to implement and took time."
good,It is a good job if you are a robot and can just work then go home. Too many people trying to step on you trying to get to the top. Too many people trying to take credit for YOUR work.  Too many people NOT playing by the rules.  Too many RULES.
good,Worked at Amgen as contingent worker. As a contingent worker you are treated as a second-class citizen. Poor management but ended up learning a lot and became a better person after experience.
good,"My experience at Amgen has a lot of mixed feelings. Never was I more excited about an opportunity for a career. Unfortunately after seven years there, I had experienced too many poor management decisions and career thwarting moments to want to move forward. Twice, due to politics, somehow my current departments were authorized to hire new outside employees at a higher pay grade than myself with less education, skill and experience who I also had to train and hand hold. The disappointing part was I was constantly volunteering for extra projects, travel opportunities, etc. but since much of that was at the discretion of your direct manager, it was apparent how much favoritism played in career advancement instead of skills, dedicated and drive. I had managers willing to bend over backwards to promote one employee while I sat there begging for a fair shot. My last straw was when I was hired under a Director and a re-organization then put my under a brand new mid-level manager who had no idea what she was doing. Once it was explained to me we had an algorithm that determined only a specific % of employees could receive advancement any given year and to quote my Director he would have to ""attend these meetings and stand on a table and light his hair on fire"" in order to quantify actually earning the raise I knew I deserved when working with Directors, VPs and even our CEO regularly, I realized that big, beautiful carrot being dangled in front me of was never going to be in reach. It was heartbreaking to want to be part of something so badly and had all the right skills and desire,"
good,"As a contractor you don't receive any benefits, so try and get into a full-time position as soon as possible.  It was difficult to do so for me, but depending on your department it may be easier.  Work hard and try and be noticed by your co-workers."
good,"First off, get used to Next Gen Work Environment - no assigned employee space - Chairs for 70% of staff Monitor resources available for 30% of those chairs. On average, you will be working off a laptop on the laptop monitor. "
good,"The workplace culture is just okay. Most people are friendly, but there is a lot of movement. Too much process takes away from innovation...nothing new."
good,"Intense corporate work environment. Great environment to learn. At this point in my life, I am no longer looking to return to Amgen."
good,"assuming you can be an actual FTE , it would be great place to stay , but the majority of roles are contract"
good,Amgen was a good company to work for. They were the leaders in Biotech in the early days of the specialty. Neupogen changed the practice of Oncology.
good,"Amgen offers an amazing science-based experience.  They are not interested in advancing themselves within the healthcare community, however.  They could do a lot more to become a resource to the client based.  The legal department needs to work with senior management to help find common ground to engage clients and work through ""value transfer"" worries."
good,"great benefits and pay, negative work environment and lack of support from management. Work schedule was not flexible at all. Goals were unclear from the get go."
good,Amgen was the typical biotech type company/culture.  Hire or expand an entire salesforce... then 'reallocate' (lay off) the majority of the headcount whenever they needed to!
good,"Too many meetings, not super productive. It would take people a week or longer to respond to an email. Very strange company culture, it was very focused on rank rather than influence or any real indicator of experience."
good,"good working environment ,work life balance, more learning opportunities,"
good,In the early days I thought Amgen was the greatest place in the world and how lucky I was to work there. However over the years the culture became very competitive internally and therefore more cut throat. When they went into the hiring freeze post 2007 it became difficult to impossible to advance in the company. Career and skill development was one the decline and then at rock bottom they laid us off.
good,result driven to meet the numbers and get updates completed by teams. The policy of making sure all are trained properly and kept current on updates is a requirement for all.
good,"I really enjoyed the first 8 months or so here at Amgen. I was learning a lot about the biotechnology industry, GMP and how science based careers are. It taught me a lot in the long run but as the months dragged on and our section was shown that it is not as important as everyone makes it out to be, I got fed up with being taken advantage of at every opportunity. "
good,"Overall Amgen is a good place to work but, like any organization, there can be work place bullying and poor management which can have ethical implications. When working with drugs that can cure or kill, ethics should always be 100% strong but, it isn't always the case.. Overall, Amgen tends to hire the best of the best . They offer an incredible gym onsite and free snacks to keep you going through the day. Overall, you are asked to work hard and you want to work hard."
good,"Good luck getting hired if you are a contract worker, they would rather keep you as a temp so they do not have to pay health insurance. It was a good job, but no chances for advancement"
good,Great place to work if you don't mind being part of an elitist culture where backstabbing to get ahead is encouraged. The most talented are pushed out and the snakes are promoted.
good,"I joined Amgen on their grad programme as the first class to be hired. It was a tough process and even when I joined, the organisation was not prepared for a grad scheme."
good,"Prima werkgever, leuk team. Op zich wel doorgroeimogelijkheden, maar je hebt de juiste contacten nodig."
good,"Amgen is in general a good place to work, exciting science, challenges, and opportunities.  People generally enjoy their jobs and what amgen stands for."
good,"I worked at Mphasis. My client project is Amgen."
good,Amgen is a good place to work. The facilities are amazing and the benefits are excellent. The company has a great work culture. People are its greatest asset
good,"working on contract. limited interaction with anyone except associate level and direct manager. no opportunities for career growth as a contact employee, hired for expertise."
good,"I was actually employed by Thermo Fisher Scientific we were contractors on site at Amgen.    Amgen management was very professional.  The only draw back was transportation,   You either took the T.  Or paid to park,   Which was about $300 per month"
good,"It's an ok place to work. Hires mainly contractors, so difficult to get permanent. Contractors do most of the jobs. Lots of opportunity to learn new skills and tools. Fellow contractors are helpful. Not much help from permanent employees."
good,"Work with some great people. "
good,I worked as an Intern at Amgen for 6 months. During my time there I learned that I really do not want to go into pharma/med chem. My manager was fairly young and inexperienced which made my experience a bit worse. The building is also very large which makes it easy to not see people for weeks. I know other people enjoyed working there but it was not the place for me.
good,I do not like working in a call center environment . But for those that do this is a good place to work if you have experience doing it . Otherwise I don't think that there is very much help to get a individual where they want you to be.
good,"A typical day at work is that there is always something to do, something to complete. I am constantly learning new information, whether it's relative to the market or competitive products."
good,"Lack of career development, asked to do more and more with no recognization. People are general very friendly, but good people are leaving fast due to lack of career advancement."
good,"The work was hard but rewarding, knowing that what we did day and day out improved the quality of life for each and every patient.  Staff worked hard to ensure quality was implemented in each and everything task performed."
good,"the company is full of energy , new learning, knowledge and it seems as if it's a college that expose you everyday to new challenges and opportunities that help you out to discover your passion and your strength,"
good,"I was a contracted person. I did not work directly for Amgen. Amgen overall is a great place to work. Stressful at times because you know that at any moment your engagement can be terminated for any reason, your fault or not."
good,I am just looking to leave Amgen of my own free will. I will neither condemn nor praise this company as a matter of principle. You are all welcome to read other reviews posted and make your own decision.
good,"Considering that I am an excellent communicator and can think quickly on my feet. I am very adaptable and do not get thrown off balance in a crisis. High-pressure roles, and in addition to my 20+ years of experience successfully turning under producing sales teams into high performers, I think those soft skills are a critical complement."
good,"I've been at Amgen for over a decade. Initially, you could have a career. You could learn. You could grow. That's all changed. "
good,"Amgen is a very competitive to work where they have periodic layoffs to remove the bottom 10% as part of the six-sigma program.  This is fine as long as you are not identified as the bottom 10%.  If you work here, you must promote yourself and network."
good,Amgen is a great place to work if you are seeking a place to get experience in the area of biologics.   I have gained a wealth of experience in Buy and Bill sales.
good,"The company has gone through much change since I was there.  At the time, they were struggling with gaining product approvals and cashflow was getting tighter.  New CEO now in place.  Corporate campus was beautiful, coworkers were supportive, collaborative and represented talent from across top pharma and biotech companies."
good,Good salary and benefits.Culture has changed over the years. Engaged scientific staff who are keen on discovering new therapeutics for grievous human illness.
good,"You get 3 weeks vacation plus 2 shut down weeks off.  The 401K plan is nice as well.  However, Amgen is no longer the small biotech company it used to be.  It is HUGE PHARMA !"
good,Good place to work - I have been working hear from past 2 years I have learned a lot from the pharm rules and regulations and the process and also learned a lot on the SAP testing
good,"After joining Amgen, I was hopeful the environment would feel like a biotech but quickly learning it was very similar to Big Pharma. It is still a good company with great products."
good,"Campus was beautiful, waterfalls, peaceful areas, gym, (note many of the privileges are for full time )  however work was not a good atmosphere, at times left alone for multiple hours at a time working with huge workloads alone. Work environment has favorites as in groups, can single you out despite hard good person, worker. Amgen has a atmosphere with the full time employees think they are .better then others, snobby over some of contractors,"
good,"I began at Amgen and loved it, however there have been huge cultural changes for the worse. Unrealistic timelines, ever increasing work with less staff and no job security."
good,"The people, work, and benefits are really great at Amgen. Unfortunately the job security if very low for this company. Also great opportunities to  travel."
good,great pay   working  conditions are  Terrible  very high stress environment and very long hours but met some great co workers.emphasis on doing anything to get ahead even if it means damaging a coworkers reputation.
good,It is a good company to work. Though it was a contract work. For me it was far that is why i had to quit.  Overall it was nice working there
good,"Good place to network and explore the scietific community, flexible work enviroment,safe campus, various activities and teamwork attitude."
good,I worked and analyst and it is a great place to work in with many benefits and perks to the employees. Very corporate goal oriented and offer training and education to their employees.
good,"I enjoyed twelve years with Amgen and am very grateful for the experience, knowledge and network of contacts.  Working in commercial manufacturing, and then the GMP Cell Banking group provided me with great insight to the overall process from discovery through filings with regulatory agencies.  The facility is absolutely beautiful and truly fosters the Amgen values: Be Science Based; Communicate, Collaborate and be Accountable; Trust and Respect Each other;  Compete Intensely and Win; Create Value for Patients, Staff and Stockholders; Work in Teams; and Ensure Quality"
good,"Fast paced, stressful, team-based environment. Quite a bit of politics and red-tape and never ending resource constraints even though the CEO's compensation is huge and unjustified. Lack of a clear mission in R&D and poor management have made the company too risk averse."
good,"I learned a lot of new tasks, it was very active environment, very hard work all the time with a lot of pressure. the hardest part was sending all the requirements in the last minute and some times over the deadline."
good,When I started Amgen was great.  Now they are less focused on their mission and more focused on stockholders
good,"I worked weekend graveyards for 7 years at Amgen.  I was able to work those hours but had hoped for advancement opportunities.  The facility in Boulder was downsized again and again, and is now shutdown and the entire manufacturing staff is being laid off on April 30 of this year.  I loved the variety of Cell Culture, Large and Small Scale Fermentation, and Purification.  I learned more about equipment and operations then I could have learned at almost any other company.  After 7 years, I was still the most junior of the manufacturing associates, as most had been there for 10+ years and one coworker for 24 years.  Hopes for advancement were not met and the opportunities few and far between.  I resigned in June of last year and am now looking for new career opportunities.  I would love to work in QA/QC or Compliance/Regulatory areas.  I love problem solving and researching noncomformances."
good,"Plezierige sfeer, leuke collega's, prettige werkomstandigheden en goede secundaire voorwaarden"
good,"Thousand Oaks, CA 2003-2004"
good,"OM, PA, Time, Payroll, ESS-MSS, ECM"
good,Great benefits and vacation time.
good,"If you are ok with being just a number, then this place is great."
good,Amgen is a great company to work for if you are in the right department.  There are many areas that I have had great experiences in and the work was very challenging and rewarding.  Unfortunately like many large companies there is a lot of re-orging and you must be careful with where you are at if you want to be there for a long term career.
good,The day to day job is challenging but fulfilling. A lot is required to reach and exceed goal such as setting up and maintaining buy and bill accounts and establishing injection networks.
good,I love the flexible  work hours but the direction is not clear with management. Good benefits if you are not contractor..............................................
good,"I did enjoy the time I worked there, It was a very difficult shift and some tough groups. I did like that they would take care of any process issues is the best way they could and in a timely manner."
good,The work is abundant so one must work smarter.  The jobs have moved out of the country and recently out of state.  There is a great divide in the perks depending on which building you are in.
good,You get an impression that this place is too business oriented.  There is no sense of job security that you constantly look for other opportunities just to protect yourself.
good,"You will meet some great people and smart scientists at Amgen.  The yearly Reduction in Force (RIFs) in October (anytime of year honestly) will keep you looking over your shoulder, but you'll enjoy the very competitive salary, bonuses, and stock compensation.  The health insurance use to be much better; however, it has been steadily   less and less stellar since 2009.  Though it is likely on par with other blue-chip biopharma companies."
good,"Excel in a lean workforce model, and manage workload independently. "
good,"Not the best place contractors, excellent for employees.  Great environment and campus and highly talented individuals."
good,"The people who work there are brilliant and have the patient interest at heart.  The corporate culture had been one that focused on bringing the best drugs to patients to treat very serious illnesses and the money would come.  In recent years, the position of CEO moved from someone in the sciences to someone in finance and with that shift so went the corporate focus.  They still make amazing drugs but it's not the paramount goal any longer.  Profit is the number one goal with making drugs being second.  It has caused a shift in the corporate culture with which I am not comfortable.  Many of the long time employees have left and that trend continues.  If money is your top priority, you would enjoy working here.  If you value people over money this might not be the right place."
good,The Amgen Washington site was a leader in scientific innovation and the people were incredibly talented
good,"Excellent company to work, the team I was working with, were very professional. The work atmosphere was great. I used to arrive to work at 7:00 AM  Started working on my project and attending meetings"
good,"You get a lot of great experiences as lower levels that enable career growth. However, it is very difficult to get promoted in a timely manner if not part of the rotational programs or if someone leaves. No work-life balance. But still a good place to get great experience."
good,The Company does important work and has talented individuals in most roles.  When I worked there they struggled with agility and transformation.  They continue to evolve.
good,Entreprise sympathique mais à trop tendance à recruter des alternants pour faire des tâches de secrétariat glorifiées.
good,"In my almost 12 years I learned a great deal about clinical trials. I feel ready for my next step of my career and although things didn't end the way I hoped, I am still grateful."
good,"Het werken bij Amgen BV vraagt om een betrokken werkhouding waarin de patiënt  centraal staat. Ik heb daardoor veel geleerd van wetgeving omtrent veiligheid, kwaliteit en privacy bij de productie van medicijnen. Met de meeste collega's had ik een goede samenwerking. Het moeilijkste was om het tempo bij te benen aan een gemechaniseerde productielijn. Het leukste was wanneer dat lukte."
good,nothing to share at this time due to company rules and regulation. many managers brought in their previous pharma cultures & leadership styles .  excellent products for patients with serious conditions
good,The company is understaffed after the reduction in force that took place in 2014 and 2015.  Fortunately there is not a high rate of turnover.
good,The people at Amgen are amongst the most professional and dedicated. They realize the impact they have on patients and take the responsibility seriously.
good,Some of the smartest people in the industry working with a real mission to serve patients.  Teams are thin and pulled in many directions by management unable to focus on key priorities.
good,"Benefits were great. Generous vacation time plus Christmas and 4th of July week off.Senior Management seemed to be lacking vision for the future, but nice, bright and respectful employees and a good work environment overall."
good,Overall a good experience.  Job flexability and benefits were great.  Management at Director level and above was sub par.
good,"Management ans Staff is friendly and very professional. A typical workday always kicks off with follow-ups with your Reporting manager. "
good,"The department I worked in everyone was trying not to get laid off, it was common to hear people through another under the bus to make themselves look better"
good,Amgen always strives to do one step better they gave me the training ever very good people have a great experience working there was able to learn a great deal about mammalian Cell manufacturing .
good,"Individuals don't speak up when they are ""mistreated"" because they are scared to lose their job. Mangers don't know their field in detail. Management and individuals who knew their processes/positions made it worthwhile and pleasant to work with. No holiday pay, time off, sick pay, vacation days, or insurance for contract workers."
good,"Medische bedrijf."
good,No work/life balance.  Managers over-work you and give you no appreciation for all the extra hours you put in.  Excellent benefits and good science though.
good,Good place to work.  I enjoyed the collaboration and the team spirit
good,"Amgen is a wonderful place to work.  I worked remotely and assisted with Inspection Readiness in Risk Management.  I understand that they passed MHRA inspection with my assistance in prep.  I was a contractor, I tried to apply for jobs within, with no assistance.  There is an inside cult of people that do not want to lose their jobs and they outsource positions."
good,"Not a very pleasant working atmosphere in the global labeling department. Discussions are not favored well. Staff are degraded and treated unfairly. Overall, not a positive working experience."
good,"Dopo aver raggiunto e superato i miei obbiettivi, non sono stato confermato"
good,Working for Amgen teaches you how to work hard to maintain clean space for medicines that are for serious illnesses. Work place is very light and flexible and amgen employees are very friendly and kind.
good,Amgen has some exceptional talent but they can't hold them and they want to deliver exceptional results every day.  A lot of people leave for good reasons.
good,"The company is (overall) good to it's workers. However, there is a definite ""dog-eat-dog"" culture at Amgen. I would recommend this company to other workers, but not to the bulk of my network"
good,"As a senior validation engineer my primary responsibility is to support new product introductions, provide project management support and deliver equipment validation.  The normal work week is 45-55 hours but because of the nature of validation the hours are flexible.  Due to recent organizational changes with the intention being a “flatter” structure; management tends to be available but relatively hands off requiring employees to be self-directing and highly independent.  The hardest part of the job is the constantly changing organizational structures which interrupts establishment of “routine” workflow and resource contacts.  The most enjoyable part of my current role is the highly knowledgeable workforce and the culture that we are serving the patients first. This shows up in the company’s focus on compliance, quality and cost structure."
good,"I have been with Amgen for long time.  During this time, I was fortunate to be trained by, and to work with the finest groups of scientists.  I have been exposed to and gained deep understanding on a wide variety of aspects of drug discovery and clinical research."
good,Amgen great company to work at..hard to get in due to lots of changes. people are friendly and supportive.
good,Low job security. High turnover within my territory. Manager not transparent. Goals no clearly understood. Not paid for growth. Turnover within team extremely high.
good,I have worked there for 16 years and have been well compensated. I learned small scale cell culture in Inoculum prep production through large scale bioreactors.
good,"Amgen is run with mostly contingent employees, no benefits. the pay is better that most companies. Difficult to become a full time employee.to receive benefits."
good,"Not a great internship program.  Direct boss was gone, so was managed by another intern.  Pretty minimal supervision, and there was no mentorship.  Seemed like a very top-down corporate environment."
good,"-Assist in building servers, troubleshooting issues, taking tests"
good,Amgen is a young organization grew up very quickly from a research based biotech to a giant company of $18+B revenue. Company culture has significantly deteriorated from organic growth company to a money driven quick results with slave driving and cut throat organization. I worked for 10 years only to find myself to be on the retooling initiative. Management is not trustworthy. You must make sure you communicate and over communicate to cover your back. Your own data will be used against you when the time comes to do a reorganization or retooling efforts. Good luck!
good,Amgen is a large Biotech company. It is a great place to work. The organization is in a transition phase with lots of changes and a fairly challenging work atmosphere.
good,I learned the process of recycling electronics. The supervisors were very down to earth while the managers seemed to be a bit tighter whne it comes to working even though they arent there and monitor work through cameras
good,"Involved in pre-launch and launch activities of most innovative product advancement in last two decades for Osteoporosis/Bone Health, Cholesterol & Migraine management."
good,"I have been in the Life Science field for more than 32 years, and still every day you may have a new challenge in the field."
good,good place to work at and get job experience. very clean environment great staffing . good hours and lovely people very high opportunity to grow in the field.
good,"It's a great place to work, but since I was a temp, I knew that my contract would end unless I was hired within, which I wasn't able to at the time due to company reorganization and restructuring. If you want to have a better chance at a permanent position here, a higher degree or more experience is a must have."
good,i was a contractor. I was not a direct employee for this firm. But  I still appreciate the overall environment for both Full Time and Contract employees.
good,"work culture was great"
good,I prefer not to comment on the workday or management style at this company. I can say that the hardest part of the job in most cases was the commute. thank you
good,"Stable company when I first started, then they started downsizing and it was difficult.  The benefits and campus was outstanding.  Lots of opportunity to contribute to the community."
good,"As a contract/temp employee, Amgen makes it very clear that you are not ""one of them"" excluding Temps from a lot of activities and access to some of the amenities (on-site gym, company summer celebration carnival, etc.) If you are an Amgen employee, it looks like you would be very well taken care of."
good,"Great place to work.  I just want to upload my resume, and find it irritating that I cannot just do that without jumping through all of these hoops..."
good,"Too much construction all over campus for too long, too little job security at this time. The company used to be great to its employees. Lots of attrition and high-level leadership leaving."
good,"While working at Amgen I learned a lot, and worked with good people. When having to take time for personal matters with family, Amgen was always understandable and accommodable."
good,"Most of the Company Products are made on this Site, the day to day work is very demanding and can be taxing to someone who is looking for a work/life balance. It does have a good culture and other benefits you can maximize."
good,"Growth potential has diminished, people are leaving in droves.  Workload is huge, which means work-life balance is dwindling.  New management in GDO questionable."
good,Very smart people looking to do the right thing for patients. Management firmly believes in continuing to drive change and continuous improvement.  New and modern workplace.  Great place to work.
good,"Amgen Brazil is small considering other AMGEN's offices worldwide because of that all employees have one or more responsibilities."
good,Amgen provides many facilities for employees; which include a fully equipped gym with shower (towel provided).  Onsite basketball and soccer courts for employees to connect outside of business context.
good,"It was a good place to work at, everyone was nice and eager to help you learn if you needed additional information. My superiors were very easy to get in touch with and reach out to."
good,"Scientific atmosphere good, job security, not so much anymore.  With the layoffs occurring more and more frequently and job locations being shifted around, it is not the workplace it used to be."
good,"I enjoyed the ride while it lasted. Although challenging at times with rapid promotions for insiders while some on the outside are left behind. However, the company had a great work-life balance program."
good,"Nice work environment."
good,"As a leading major pharmaceutical company, Amgen does generously compensate its employees. The drawback is that job security can be very volatile."
good,"	Also have Very Good Experience in configuring Workday Organization Structure, Company, Cost Centers, Jobs and Positions, Staffing, Recruiting, Benefits, Compensation, Talent & Merit, Performance and Payroll"
good,Eentonig werk. Ik kan er momenteel niet veel meer over vertellen omdat dat misschien niet objectief zou doordat ik teleurgesteld ben om het beëindigde dienstverband en de manier waarop dat is gegaan.
good,"I learned a lot at Amgen. Most of the people were friendly. Since there was not a lot of black at the site I worked at, I feel like I was treated very well. Maybe they worried that I would make a complaint if I was treated poorly, but who knows but I guess I was lucky. My managers were extremely helpful and once they assign you your work as long as you met the deadline they were not on your case asking you whether you had completed the work. They trusted me."
good,I think this is a very good place to work due to it's work team and management. Non stress work environment. Safety and quality oriented
good,"Worked with audio technician, Instructional Designers, Project Managers and SMEs to develop curriculum.  No control with clients changing their needs (scope Creep) and no adjustment in the schedule."
good,"Site is closing, so there will not be any further opportunities in Colorado.  Amgen is a great place to work with great benefits, challenging and ever changing environment."
good,"Great company to work for if you are a permanent staff member. Unfortunately, many departments rely heavily on hiring temp workers to save money. It seems that very few are able to secure a permanent position."
good,"Great program to work for. Good benefits. Excellent products. "
good,Amgen is a good place to work with good work-life balance. There is also a good chance to learn new things and get better at your job.
good,"This was a short term contract. Great oppotunity with training and personnal building. Good work environment, unfortunate to see them leave."
good,"I learned a tremendous amount about the pharma industry and global regulatory requirements while working for Amgen."
good,"This company provides great benefits and I have had a great work life balance. I have learned alot about the biotechnology field in the last 10 years. My co-workers are fantastic and each of us help to get the job done."
good,Advancing science and helping patients - these dual passions are ingrained in our culture.
good,"Company in middle of transitioning to focus on bottom line (shared services, releveling, layoffs).  Lost focus on its core mission I believe.  Even after DAI, no one wants to make tough decisions, those needing to be informed aren't, those that need to advise aren't always the right ones.  Amgen had already changed significantly in the last 10 years.  It will be totally different again in the next 10 as well."
good,It could be tough with day to day operations due to lack of ability to keep staff.  Site is now closed.
good,"This job is amazing, lucky to have my first supervisor position here. The company, Amgen, is great. My company, Securitas, is one of the better security companies I've been with. However, Amgen is closing their Seattle, Colorado, and Bothell sites so I'm looking to relocate into a postion closer to my degree."
good,"Amgen is a good company to work for. Talented scientists, solid science, nice benefits"
good,Great support to improving processes and delivering new ones.
good,"Busy all day building and packaging, vials, syringes, Auto Injector devices for clinical trials. Learning the ins and outs of how Drugs are made and tested before being sent out for trial to patients. Work environment is fun, working close with your multiple coworkers all day every day. Long hours some weeks and floating time schedule makes knowing when you could be going home questionable. Wrking closely with such fun and great people and helping lives of others makes it worth while."
good,"Good company to work for, but limited opportunities for advancement."
good,"Finance professional who tracks budgets resulting in innovative program and customer service solutions.  Solves complex problems where finance and supplier administration interrelate. Works effectively with cross-functional teams.  In-depth knowledge, understanding and analysis of cost performance which affect the stock price. Supervises and trains employees. Strong working knowledge of SAP. "
good,great culture with focus to cure patients.  Lots of educated scientists and micro-biologists make for an interesting mix of people.
good,"I learned a lot in my 13 years at this company.   Many different systems, implemented dozens of million dollar projects"
good,"This extensive and challenging experience within AMGEN has afforded me the opportunity to simultaneously develop my analytical skills on Excel files - within health economics modelling and outcomes research missions on pipeline products before their launch on the French market – as well as my writing and my ability to summarize complex issues into short English working notes providing input to top management on biosimilars' legislation, pricing and Health Policy – through Public Policy missions. "
good,Amgen is a great place to work.  It has provided a wealth of knowledge in the production of human therapeutics.
good,A good company to work for they take really good care of there regular employees.
good,Everyone works together as a team at Amgen in a fast paced environment .
good,Good company with plenty of work and new projects. Worked on a team of messaging engineers.
good,"Pros:"
good,This is a great company that attracts talented individuals. A typical day at work is relatively challenging physically and mentally. The work is rewarding when management empowers their colleagues. The co-workers are generally sound.
good,"good work life balance, culture is lacking, unfriendly environment"
good,"gostei muito de trabalhar no bergamo/amgen,"
good,I was an Admin to the Manager of QA. She was not easy to work for. I did accomplish many things there that are still in use today. I was able to develope a database that is used in a back-end environment for SOP's. Many of the friends I have today were co-workers from my Amgen days back in the early '90's.
good,"Good working conditions and compensation/benefits."
good,"Business casual work environment, clean and functional. Great personnel, but majority contract work. This makes long term employment impossible because turn over contract unexpectedly."
good,"- Fast paced work environment where multitasking is commanded"
good,Your life is better if you area FTE at Amgen rather than a CW. Overall great place to work but changeling for the CWs as parts of the company is closed off or they are treated differently. This environment is changing but some areas and people are slower to change.
good,"Lives the Values. Patients are always first. Fair pay and opportunities. Good culture with a lot of professional respect. When I left the company, I had almost all positive interactions with my previous co-workers. I would only suggest that they need to put more effort towards training single women who travel on behalf of the company."
good,"Echt dynamish, positief athmosphere en goede colegas"
good,"Former F/T staff, returned as contractor. Self-motivated, engaged in hi priority work to completion, exec assist. hr consult, proj mgmt, Hi-performer."
good,"Fast paced, collaborative environment with several daily shifts in priorities setting the pace. Good location and campus setting with ample places to grab food on the go!"
good,"Amgen offers good working setup for chemists with good support and training. Mangers are knowledgeable and friendly. But overall, there are not enough projects to utilize all chemists to their full ability."
good,"I worked with some great people, management included.  We worked hard, but being on a 4/10 schedule really made for a great work/life balance.  I enjoyed the work that I did there, but working through a contractor was definitely not an enjoyable experience."
good,"Good location for easy commute, managers are nice to communicate, helpful co-workers, after it was changed to BI, it became a fast paced contract lab, a lot of people left."
good,"This company has very strict Security policies which can often make you feel like just a human prop, posted up somewhere just to give off a certain presences. The pay is much higher than non-union Security Officers but dealing with all the politics can get to be too frustrating."
good,"Overall, a great place to work! The people are kind, the premise is great. They have 24/7 security, several cafeteria’s, gym, day-care and an occupational health department."
good,They are right on it when there is something you need.  Always responding with in a couple of hours of email or call.  Very professional office. would recommend working for them.
good,"fast learning and fun working environment, being able to work with others and solving customers issues as group. helpful staff"
good,"Lo mejor de mi trabajo es que es muy variado, y realizo diferentes tareas a lo largo de la jornada."
good,"Shrinking pains, good workforce, educated, work-life balance, troubled waters ahead. Needs a better senior management level and include workforce in architecture/working models."
good,"While I had a great summer experience at Amgen, this was tempered by the announcement soon after my arrival that the company would be laying off 20% of its workforce. This contributed to a time of high stress and uncertainty. The future for Amgen looks  to be more of the same."
good,Its a great place to work if you like the fast pace and high demand of the job. The resources that are available are top notch. You must be will to be part of a culture that is driven to make the best possible product.
good,"I joined the professional team to manage the major oncology accounts in New Jersey.  Within six months the groups of accounts I was managing performed so well that placed me in the top 10 percentile performer of the company.  I also had opportunity to launch two new major bio-tech products.  During the launch there was uncapped bonus period, which provided great opportunity for the top performers.  This 2 years my earning was in excess of 170K"
good,"A typical day consists of completing environmental reports for the suite's on site. Dealing with daily BMS requests and completing BMS daily checks. Completing a variety of different surveys on site and daily requests from senior engineers. "
good,"•On a daily basis, co-facilitate prioritization meetings, evaluate job plans, and update equipment parts with logistics."
good,E' un'azianda in cui si da massima importanza alla costruzione del team.
good,"For the most part, Amgen is not a bad place to work if you get the right mgr.  Seems that many managers are incompetent and lack an understanding on how to manage without being a dictator/micro manager.  Of course, org changes happen bi-monthly so keeping a good manager is a hard thing to do.  Layoffs seem to be the new HR mantra as well as an increased workload.  So, if you can walk on eggs shells and are covered in Teflon you will survive and be compensated well."
good,I worked in the corporate law department of the legal department at Amgen.  We handled the corporate governance and securities for the company.  We handled highly confidential information.
good,"I would recommend this company to someone just graduating from college and looking to gain experience in a fortune 500 company. If one started later in their career, this would be a stifling place. My experience overall was positive. The negatives are lack of advancement opportunities, long hours expected, and generally poor morale amongst collegues."
good,"This is not the small company that it used to be and it shows. As senior management changes, the company is taking on a ""big company"" environment rather than a ""fun and friendly"" place to work."
good,"empresa boa mais , necessita melhorar o ambiente e preparo"
good,"I have been with Amgen inc for 4years. One of the great biotech company to work with. Lot of promising pipeline drugs. But if you supervisor is not great, then all your effort are waste."
good,"At this point, I cannot provide a review. I might at some point, but (for now) I can't. Thank yo for asking though... Standby and you just might see something good, or bad--you'll just have to wait."
good,Working at amgen was a good experience to start in the pharmaceutical field.  The experience gave exposure to cGMP and lean manufacturing process with a lot of opportunities to learn on the job.
good,"in a lot of ways, Amgen is like the New York Yankees of biotech.  They acheive a lot, have a ton of resources, are very business-like, and that's pretty much it."
good,Empresa que vem crescendo muito no Brasil e melhorando em seus processos gerais.
good,Cool place to work. This review is not 150 characters long so now I have to type a bunch of nonsense in order to be able to submit it and move on with my day.
good,"Dermatology representative for the New Haven CT territory, my responsibilities included the promotion of ENBREL to both the Dermatology and Rheumatology markets. Recognized for the ability to effectively communicate utilizing evidence-based medicine, develop and implement business plans, identify growth opportunities, appropriately manage territory budgets and exceed goals. Good company, great products"
good,As the largest independent biotech company Amgen brings incredible science to the health care community.  For such a large company it still seems small in many ways.  The company culture does not lead by example for work/live balance and feels like it is 75% focused on stock price and 25% on its sales force.
good,"Good place to work, good people, good culture, but very tough to get decisions made due to bureaucracy.  The culture changed a lot in the last few years resulting in many people leaving the company."
good,"very nice clean enviorment  to work , a great place to learn a lot in the field but the chances of long term employment are very slim to none its mainly contacted work.and not payed as well as should be for the work conducted."
good,"Empresa me proporcionou muitos aprendizados, além de ter ótimos benefícios e excelentes profissionais."
good,"Highly paid, high stress but kind of worth it if you want to save some money up.Nice people to work with. Good running culture at lunchtimes. Encouragement to get out of the office at lunch. Frequent company meetings to feed back global and local results of trials and future pipeline, makes you feel involved even if you are the post person or a cleaner."
good,"The company is restructuring and changing work settings at the same time. Team work is encouraged but challenging. The new environment is open work space. It tends to be very quiet, more so than in the old ""cubicle"" setup."
good,Strong corporate culture with good support for growth. Difficult to promote and some challenges with internal career growth. Great work/ life balance and beautiful area.
good,"Great people and benefits. Excellent campus and dedicated workers."
good,Nice place to work.  The area and campus is beautiful.  My fellow employees were competent and supportive.   Very innovative and open to new ideas and ways of doing things.
good,"Business analysis, meetings, process workflow and documentation"
good,"Loved my time at Amgen, however with all the reorganizations It gets frustrating.  Got shifted around many times but ended up enjoying the overall experiences and people."
good,Worked through a temp agency. watched several FTEs get laid off. This was unannounced and unexpected. When you  become an FTE there are really great benefits Amgen offers on-site daycare.
good,"Nice work environment, pay was good but no benefit for CW. If work as regular employee it will have bebefit including health,dental,vision insurance, stock option, bonus, and 401K."
good,The time that I have spent with Amgen has been amazing.  The research and development focuses on finding cures for patients with an unmet need.  They pride themselves in launching biologics that change the game for the pharmaceutical market.
good,I was outsourced to Amgen for 5.5 years - my duties were building maintaining and decommissioning Information Systems (application servers) - Full life cycle including fix and repair
good,"I wish they would hire more from within, instead of hiring whole new teams to replace others. I learned a great amount from my peers and my manager and will use this to further my career!"
good,Excellent work environment; however constant restructuring and shift to contract workers leaves many employees uncertain about their future.  Good benefits.
good,"There is no typical day which means each day is always different. This is what makes the work challenging and worthwhile. "
good,"This is a Company that people from around the world dream about working for.  They do work you as much as possible, for as long of hours that you'll give them, but if you are in the science side of the business, it is for a good cause.... Medicine"
good,"Although Amgen has great benefits and a wonderful work-life balance, the climate is very political.  Lots of activities are required just to ensure that the optics are positive or well received.  Makes it hard to get things done sometimes."
good,"Empresa muito boa, bem gerenciada e com bons planos"
good,"Beautiful place to work, a lot of freedom as long as you are productive.  Has become more competitive as a result of reorganization.  Worked as a contractor spanning 5 years; management should consider hiring full timers instead of contractors.  Can be stressful but overall the best company I have worked for."
good,Great place to work until the new CEO took over 2 years ago.  Now employees are a number.  The Corporate focus is all business (stock prices and share holders) rather than patients and R&D.
good,"good experience, learned a lot of new skills, and enjoyed time spent with this employer."
good,"Overall a solid company. Due to low turn over, advancement opportunities are minimal. Some management are stagnant and not open to new ideas."
good,"It is a very cool experience, if you do have a contract be aware that they can let you go at any time, no matter how good you are...if you have a chance to work for Amgen, try to get a permanent position."
good,"Fun place to work, really great pay/benefits package, not the best place for advancement, and lots of uncertainty under the new CEO."
good,"Account Management"
good,Si lavora in un ambiente aperto alle ultime tecnologie con spazi di condivisione nei diversi settori operativi. Grossa crescita professionale e umana.
good,"Good company to work for day to day. Enjoyed working the employees."
good,New leadership is reorganizing many areas. Somewhat discomforting place to work at the moment. Some great managers and some people who should never be managers. You're in a good place if you get lucky with your manager.
good,"The company is great to their employees! Beautiful campus, great benefits, great cafeterias. Remote work is frowned upon and is solely up to your manager which can decrease employee morale. Every dept is different and may not have that issue. All executional work is outsourced so you’re left with working on managing vendors vs executing. Forced to stay in positions for at least 18 months, little to no promotions. Travel is non-existent for global positions unless you’re a MD or Sr. manager.  Best part, summer and winter paid shut downs for FTEs."
good,Decent company. Nice modern offices. Recently too many changes. Not many career advancement opportunities. Salary relatively lower than other peers. Long working hours. Work life balance not as good as it used to be.
good,"	System owner for 2 complex applications"
good,Management largely looked out for employees by comparison to the general marketplace. Lay-offs became standard with consolidation in biotech space. This is a place you stay at.
good,"good company with lots of good people; can be difficult to promote or build brand if you did not ""grow up here"".   Beautiful home office campus with lots of support.  Company has an awesome relocation package and support system to help with transition.  Very expensive area to live in so keep this in mind when negotiating salary if you are moving to California."
good,"Traveled continuously as a IT Project Manager. Because of the growth in the company , everyone was stressed. Many divorces . No balance in family and work life."
good,"International and multi disciplinary environment, with good to have short- and long term challanges."
good,"I worked at Amgen as an intern before their Seattle campus was closed. It was an awesome internship, gained a lot of lab bench skills and was paid well."
good,Amgen is a great place to work as a full time employee. Their benefits are amazing. The new generation workspaces are incredible. They've put a lot of thought and investment in making it an enjoyable environment to work in.
good,"Very professional people, only the best work there.  They will reward you for hard work and the benefits are bar none.  There is no work-life balance."
good,"Challenging work environment with high rewards to help patients and opportunity to work with extremely diverse and high caliber, caring people.  The mission and goals drive a productive culture"
good,Very fast paced and dynamic environment. Very capable people. Excellent benefits. Many amenities available onsite. Beautiful campus. Lots of lectures and training classes available.
good,"Great if you are a full-time employee, but those can be hard to get if you don't know someone that currently works there. Connections are everything, otherwise they hire up from contractors."
good,"Amgen used to be a great company to work for, until they started outsourcing all their work. Experienced people were let go, while incompetent leaders were promoted."
good,"Good coworkers and most people are very helpful.  Job rotation is possible, depending on current position.  Layoffs happen often and job security is sketchy."
good,"Amgen is a job, the company has high expectations of its employees and applies pressure to always do more.  Your plate is full but there is always more you can do.  You will be stressed out of your mind and therapy of all sorts will be needed to get you through this job.  You are a number not a person and if you try to apply internally for another position within the company, you need to know someone or else you won't advance."
good,"Having been with the company for over 10 years I have learned that change is constant; however, this does create opportunities for growth and advancement, but it requires initiative from the staff to make these opportunities happen."
good,Amgen is a great place to work if you are looking for stability and fair pay.  It has a standard Corporate culture that can be hard to manage and some departments are more out of balance than others.  Overall Amgen treats it's employees well.
good,"Empresa em franco crescimento proporcionando um desenvolvimento profissional destacado."
good,"With a larger and more established company, the resources were much more abundant. The departmentalizing within the group was amazing. Allowed more focus on specific responsibilities for the respective role. Management was constantly focused on improving the processes, which is absolutely great, but they did not focus on unifying a process that everyone should follow. As my role focused on supporting others, it was hard to support Person A with style A and then transition to Person B and supporting in style B."
good,"Leuk bedrijf om voor te werken. Goede werksfeer, leuke collega's."
good,"Amgen had excellent products with a great fair company culture.  I was fortunate to have a great team that worked hard to achieve and exceed our goals with our products.  As a team, we worked very well together but understood that certian individuals had better relationsihips with certain physicians and was able to use this strategy to achieve our territory goals."
good,Amgen was a good company to work for. Management overall was good but had issues removing poor management from the structures. Manufacturing seemed to be pushed beyond their limits. Good benefits and pay.
good,"I was blessed to work at Amgen's Washington sites. The group of people there, not only in my group/department, but across all functions at the site were the best of the best.  Everyone was dedicated to the mission.  My immediate manager was truly someone unique and special to work for.  She absolutely made sure that her reports had a strong work/life balance (even if she didn't adhere to that for herself).  My immediate group of co-workers is what I loved the most and what I miss the most now that AWA has been closed down."
good,Amgen is a fast paced place to work. Being at the cutting edge of science is extraordinary with access to many gifted minds and resources. What detracted from the work at hand was the constant re-organizations and shuffling of teams.
good,"hectisch en veel eisend"
good,"Top talent, but environment uncertain due to layoffs and voluntary packages.  Signs of buy out or big pharma acquisition."
good,"Amgen is a great place to work if you can survive the pressure.  the pay and benefits are some of the best and they expect a lot in return.  If you are willing to give Amgen your time, blood, sweat and tears they will reward you with a career path of your dreams.  You will have to sacrifice your home life to make it at Amgen."
good,"Amgen got money to buy high end equipment!"
good,"We submitted clinical and post market adverse events to the FDA on a daily basis.  I learned a lot about compliance and regulatory affairs with a great team and manager."
good,"Amgen Seattle is a great place to work"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was my team and customers! My current manager was very helpful in my development.
good,"Amgen is a good company overall, but recent changes brought about by management have diminished their focus on discovery research. They have shown a tendancy to sacrifice long term success for short term financial gain much like the rest of the pharmaceutical industry at this time."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was helping co-workers from other departments being able to perform their job responsibilities.
good,"Good place to work with good management, good learning scope, good working culture."
good,Overall a good company to work for. The culture is relatively positive and there are opportunities to promote within. Big changes happen and restructuring occurs almost every year.
good,"Decent company to work for. Not much to complain about. Overall really decent. There's not much to ask for. Show up, do your job, go home without many issues or problems."
good,"Great company not much to say. Typical day began going to review meetings of daily issues. Oversaw my projects, investigated high priority issues. My co workers for the most part were some of the best people to work with."
good,Amgen is a great company with a great mission.  I feel very honored to represent the oncology portfolio and show the advances that we are making in the lives of patients.
good,"Amgen is a large global biotechnology company that has its share of ""big pharma"" challenges: Political in-fighting over resources, restrictive budgets that impose obstacles to planning, slow-moving decision-making, too many unhelpful meetings, regional teams that do not want to follow the ""global"" rules, and upper management that does not truly delegate to its team members on ""important"" decisions. "
good,Amgen is very good place to work. Partners are very helpfull. They offer to the employees a free lunch in the afternoons. It is a place where you can develop your professional skills as well your personnel skills.
good,Out dated process using Roller Bottles. People were great. Loved working there. Bonuses were good. Company as a whole treated employees fairly and management was good but conservative with decisions.
good,"Amgen has great benefits, great people, superb campus, and always looks to advance their employees through training.  Health and retirement benefits were top in the area and the people Amgen hires are smart, friendly, and open minded."
good,The company work environment is fast paced and demanding. There is no shortage or lack of work. Working in this environment makes the time go extremely fast.
good,"Stressfull, fast-paced, but plenty of opportunity to learn new disciplines.  Great benefits, time off, 2 yearly shutdowns allowed to unwind plus an additional 3 weeks of PTO."
good,"Change is constant at Amgen,  if you work in the US there are lots of room to grow,  outside of the US,  not many opportunities to grow your career.  "
good,I really enjoy working with the people here. All of my colleagues are extraordinarily intelligent and critical thinkers. I respect my co-workers immensely.
good,"Based on current position, it did not provide clear and concise direction.  Often conflicting views were presented and there was no clear leadership provided."
good,"I was a temp at Amgen (through Yoh Scientific) and always wanted to be a full-time employee there. Their benefits and work environment looked amazing (employee programs, health insurance, health incentives, etc). However, as a temp I barely had any work. It was nice that when I did have work I could do it without being micromanaged and on my own schedule. As long as you finished by the due date they were very flexible"
good,"The only thing I would change about Amgen is how slow/difficult it is to move up or move sideways in the organization. "
good,Very good place to work.Good work culture and lotsof opportunities to move ahead within the company . Learned more along the way while working at Amgen.
good,"Family oriented, experienced colleagues, unfortunately they do not hire many FTE any more. They now mostly do contract workers. Which is OKAY. However, you lose out on a lot of perks. Entry level wage is fair to good. Cafeteria has great food, but not free."
good,"Focus on employees thriving with work/life balance being a focal point. Competitive compensation and above average benefits package. Employees have the opportunity - and are largely encouraged - to make use of offers such as an onsite soccer pitch, basketball courts, volleyball court, gym etc. and points can be built towards reducing one's health care contribution."
good,"Award winning, revenue driving, dynamic, and creative sales and marketing leader for biotech/pharmaceutical manufactures, payers/access and bio/pharma consulting firms."
good,"Fast-paced, competitive culture. Work / life balance needs improvement. New CEO is very industry savvy and is making good strategic decisions for the company's future. Company culture is very inclusive and innovation-focused. An exciting place to work."
good,"Great place to work that provides top notch benefits. Best opportunities for advancement, as well as best management, lie outside of the Quality Control department. There seem to be regular layoffs/RIFs every few years, which can lead to worry about job security. These are not based on performance, but rather business need, so one can be blindsided."
good,"Pros:"
good,Amgen is one of those rare companies where the employees care and management does many things to ensure they are taken care of and have what they need
good,"There is a good work/balance, the compensation/benefit is great, my Quality Assurance Software Testing manager is awesome, but there are limited advancement opportunities."
good,"Período de muito desafio e oportunidades. "
good,"Amgen is a great place to work, excelling at work life balance.  The company culture is relaxed and flexible. The business model involves buying up smaller biotechs as well as performing in house research to help make advance medicines."
good,"The culture is great, middle management is insightful and kind, but it's impossible to get a job-or keep one-with Amgen.  They have a tendency to treat contractors as second-class citizens, which is really too bad, considering a large chunk of their staff is contractors."
good,"Great paying company"
good,"Fast-paced work environment."
good,"People work efficiently, doing great science."
good,"I liked the company, culture, location and work ethics of people who worked with me. People are driven to do more and do better. A good place to wor, grow and retire. I was there with a Tata consulting Services, so I will be moving to another client."
good,"The people and culture are great, but the advancement is limited."
good,"My typical day was working on my financial model, and consulting people about how to achieve best results. "
good,"60+ hours"
good,"Aggressive growth program, well capitalized construction project in Rhode Island .  Worked as a subcontractor for thei expansion program. Resources were placed in an efficient manner"
good,A very challenging place to work.  It made me better at what I do.  I drew on all my professional skills to be able to handle to amount of responsibility that I was expected to carry.
good,"Great work environment with significant resources to accomplish goals.  Opportunities for cross-functional training, job advancement, and gaining exposure to diverse research programs/issues."
good,"Amgen is a value-based company that embraces new technology and innovation to promote patient health. They are a biologics company, and believe in transforming science into therapies to save/improve lives ."
good,"We had a wonderful team of Engineers, Facility Managers, Instrumentation and Maintenance Techs that supported MFG of Imlygic drug product that is an oncolytic therapy for metastatic melanoma."
good,Amgen is a very good strategic company and they align their goals with the employees in mind.  Amgen treats their employees fairly and rewards employees for success.  Amgen has a great reputation in Oncology
good,"Excellent employer with strong company values. Working at Amgen, you truly have an opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of patients.  Compensation and benefits are best in class, and you will be surrounded by extremely intelligent and talented people."
good,Overall a good company to work for. Work life balance is good along with the work and culture. Could improve on who was hired in areas of management. Would recommend.
good,"Overall a good work environment with a decent pipeline. Competitive pay. However, there is some mismanagement at the top and not enough transparency provided which creates stress on everyone. No one wins."
good,"I worked as a teaching assistant for the biotechnology workshop program at Fullerton College supported by Amgen. As a teaching assistant for this program, I gained valuable experience in applying my own basic entry-level laboratory skills in a class setting. Also, I gained valuable experience in social interactions and leadership roles."
good,Flexible schedule / competitive pay / benefits / good people doing the work Upper MGT  has no clue and takes credit for other people work. Senir staff should be knowledgeable if they are Dir. level.
good,I had a great experience at Amgen with very good managers. Amgen offers great benefits along with work life balance.  I would recommend this company to job seekers.
good,"A very nice place to work and meet people. Nice Management and Staff. Free food and coffee, and very medical oriented. Would go back there if offered employment."
good,Great company to work for! Great benefits and great drugs. Struggling sales for Cv drug make it very difficult to hit goals. Not realistic expectations from management.
good,Great company and lots of opportunity to learn. The company really forces you to flex your muscles when it comes to knowledge and experience. It's a great place to work.
good,"Working with teams to solve problems and improve processes. Very collaborative culture with enthusiasm to move forward, mistakes are quickly forgiven by all so that progress can be made."
good,It is a great place to work with supportive managers. The manager i worked under was so supportive since it was an area i was new to.The working environment too was relaxed and not as fast paced as i expected it to be
good,Great Company. Patients first. Excellent Mission. Great Products. Worked here for 25 years. Outstanding place to work. Would recommend the company as a place to work.
good,A great place to work with talented staff in all disciplines. PMO strives to meet company objectives to deliver technical solutions in support of business with  focused  on-time and cost containment of deliverable's.
good,"The job culture is very casual and comfortable. It is a very progressive company and also very health conscious. I believe they care about their employees and show it in many ways.My building has a wellness room where you can go and rest if you have a headache or other minor issue. There are recreation areas and outdoor areas that encourage both group work and individual."
good,"Good company to work for.Worked there as an Independant Consultant. Company Culture was great.  Have nothing bad to say about this company. Very fast paced company,"
good,"a lot of management changes, loss of continuity with new employees/management.  culture changed from entrepreneurial to bureaucratic.  succession planning is a myth as top roles are filled from outside."
good,"Amgen has evolved from a small and intimate biotech/pharma company to a large Biotech/Pharma behemoth company.  During this transition the company lost its soul and spirit to grow, nurture, coach and mentor its employees.   Now everything is profit and results driven with little concern for the health, welfare and moral of its employees!"
good,Une super expérience même si les postes à alternants entraînent une difficulté à retenir l'expertise au sein de l'entreprise.
good,Although my time with Amgen was only a temporary assignment I learned a great deal and traveled to both the Rhode Island and Cambridge locations to conduct new hire orientation class.
good,Amgen has a great work culture. Everyone I worked with was friendly and it was a great team dynamic. I was able to learn past my initial work job responsibilities.
good,A fast pace environ ment working with fun employees.The work there is hectic but managable.i had so much experience working with the best teamates.And they gave free meals everyday.
good,"I was at Amgen prior to their very first layoffs. At that time, the culture was still one of a small Biotech but with the security of a strong pipeline and revenue stream. I was able to advance quickly , take risks, and have freedom to make decisions."
good,"I was a contractor for Amgen so I cannot speak as an employee."
good,"Great place to work with amazing benefits. Benefits not as great as they used to be but still very good. There are a lot of uncertainty with job security these days.

good,"The only thing that brings the rating down is the fact that Amgen Inc is down-sizing and the job security was not rated very well.  I had worked for this company through Lancaster Laboratories once before and was very fortunate to be able to work there again as a full time employee.  My coworkers were all top notch employees and had a great wealth of knowledge.  In my time there I quickly trained in and started performing water assays and sampling, environmental monitoring, culture maintenance, scheduling, and many more incidental duties.  The potential for unplanned work was the hardest part of the job.  Due to challenges arising during production there were days that I would be required to work up to a 16 hour day.  The people there were great and I have several friends that I keep in touch with.  This experience gave me a broad knowledge of QC in pharmaceutical microbiology."
good,"Most challenging and at the same time more fun, co-workers are supportive."

I enjoy being in the lab with my co-workers, working while still talking and having fun."

good,My job was to support the scientist develop new drugs to fight cancer and other illnesses.
good,"I really enjoyed the company. Their biggest problem is their loyalty to their managers over their employees. I had first-hand experienced of a manager that continuously broke their policies; but when several employees advised the company, the manager lied and their word was taken over all of their employees. They later found out what was said was true and demoted the manager. However by that time, they lost 3 great employees. They also have a no rehire policy which is also a big mistake on their part."

A lot of perks, such as time off to spend with family, great benefits, and flexible hours, but could have had more work from home hours and positions in general.

They were patient and kind, and great to get along with, easy to communicate with. The hardest part of the job for me was thinking a few steps ahead to know what to prepare for experiments; initially, I wasn't too familiar with the SOPs, so making the prep work my second nature took some effort.

good,A typical day started with researching more data if needed for setting up an assay and then performing the immunohistochemistry staining.
