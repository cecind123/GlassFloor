rating,review
bad,The place sucked and the people sucked. The management were not friendly and would smoke weed in the back room while they forced us to work an 8 hour shift with no breaks or lunch during the day
bad,"Worst management you could think of, which breeds a horrible work enviroment. No raises, you might get a raise if you brown nose enough. Only thing this company cares about is how much upper management and doctors make, at any cost. They do not appretiate their employees at all, unless your up someones you know what."
bad,"This is the worst sales role I have ever had. They have no set territories, No Marketing Campaigns,Horrible management. Their pricing model is super expensive compared to the competition like ADP or Trinet. You need your own account list and connections for any chance of success."
bad,"[Altivon] Most dysfunctional management team I have ever experienced. Hostile, distrustful, paranoid environment, no plan, no communication strategy."
bad,"Interesting job but right fit companies are few, many are turned away for health history, workers comp history and pricing in Orlando is the same as Manhattan."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend to work under poor Payroll management. Terrible experience, no help when complained to their main office in TX. They DO NOT care about their employees. Also their Friday's company's meetings are waste of time. No any companies are doing this Friday's meeting, it delays all PS work. Friday's meeting can be once in 2-3 months. Happy I left. My manager was abusive and mean."
bad,"Not enough time wa a given to grasp training materials"
bad,"Hiring manager has to like the person and willing to give credit to him, should not tell his mistakes, if you say so he labels as no soft skills."
bad,Excellent pay and compensation package. Poor go to market strategy for Ohio. Very high pressure atmosphere. They provide a valuable service but only to a very small market segment at their price.
bad,"The benefits and co-workers are great. However, the management team truly believes they are superior to everyone else. That is why they pay so low. They know people will work there because they are they are a top rated employer and they won’t have to pay for experience. Either you do things management’s way or you will be marked for the remainder of your career there."
bad,That's about it. Unless you are in the popular clique you do not get promoted. Pay is way less than other companies pay for payroll specialist or implementation. However a lot of company activities and training meetings every Friday. Also have a lot of volunteer opportunitys.
bad,Management was scared to make decisions that would better the business as they were under strict orders by one persons directives for better or worse.  Constant changes with little to no time for previous changes to take effect.
bad,The upper management appear to push for a more relaxed collaborative environment. But local management is only concerned about maintaining the status quo rather than in getting things done. No consideration for lower level employees
bad,"I came to East Tennessee from Nashville.  I was working for a Christian organization there and in a corporate office.  I went to work for temporary agencies until I found the position at Insperity."
bad,It was an overall ok place to work at. I sat behind the desk all day and took one or two breaks it made the time go by faster to me. I would go back but need to find a different route.
bad,"Challenging work environment, with unprofessional and unqualified managers. Employees are put in a class system and treated as though they are line workers in a factory setting."
bad,"As many benefits as Insperity has, they think every aspect of their business far surpasses their competition. Unfortunately everything is antiquated: their products, culture, vacation policies, business strategies. About the only good thing was the benefits were pretty rich."
bad,"This is a good company that pays fairly at the start. Setting meetings to hear the sales pitch from a 10 year sales person. Everything is split, in the end all your leads go back to the tenured sales management staff."
bad,I was not trained properly and the training teller I was placed with was rude and unfeeling. I felt like it did not matter to her if I showed up or not and she was always telling me that every other person she had trained was better than me.
bad,Hardest part of the job is having to cold call. If you do not already have past networking connections then you face many challenges. I did not know that I had to provide 100% of leads.
bad,"Insperity has a high employee churn rate. It's culture was initially supportive, then became less involved as time went on. The stress on performance was very high, causing people to leave for other opportunities."
bad,"You know how some organizations take something relatively straightforward and then over-complicate it? That sums up my experience, in a sentence."
bad,Come if you are desperate and like to work in a freezer. This is a warehouse that has to keep food at a certain temp. Forget about employee health and safety.
bad,"Insperity on a national level does take care of there employees very well. They pay great and provide top of the line benefits, but the Culture in individual offices vary greatly. Management does not try to help you reach your goals but demands you hit your numbers. Lots of finger pointing, but no real help to reach sales numbers. Very High turnover, but if you can last. The compensation is well worth it."
bad,"Insperity (formerly Administaff) was originally my ideal job.  Working as an HR Consultant to small business was rewarding and challenging.  However, the amount of assigned clients, manager expectations, travel, reports and ultimately client turnover became too much.  The fact that outstanding tenured employees are pushed out the door for often inexperienced employees is troubling.  The service center has experienced turnover from the general manager level to the support team. Morale has been low for years, leadership is rigid, hypocritical and the performance system is a disgrace.  Salary for service center employees who actually do the work, has always been below benchmarks although we provide salary surveys for clients!  Hypocrisy at the highest levels.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this cesspool."
bad,"You walk in go to clock in see whats on the menu prepare the dinning room for either breakfast, lunch, or dinner when its all over you clean up and prepare for the person working the next shift."
bad,"as a sales rep, you will need to know the ins and outs of how to hide administrative costs within the taxes.  management at the time was awful and would mistreat his employees, but he is no longer there."
good,"It depends on the team. Although management speaks of servant membership, I don't see much of that. Some management can be, and to be generous, a little rough around the edges. It makes the smallest thing difficult and impossible to become efficient"
good,"busy"
good,"If you are in the HCM space I wouldn't choose to sell Insperity over some of the newer more disruptive benefit providers.   Positioned as a premium offering, most companies will not be able to fully utilize the  premium  services.  Old school grinder sales managers and high turn-over plague the company."
good,Insperity often looses site of their purpose and does not enforce the same policies we want out clients to.  management often does not have the skills
good,"The home office personnel were very supportive!  The inside team was really the highlight of that work experience. The training program at the home office was very well executed. The experience in my office fell short of my expectations. Very little support, and a noticeable absence of new ideas on marketing their product offerings."
good,"Overall the company is really great, and provides great, premium services to their clients."
good,"Great benefits and vacation.  High Turnover. Heard the CEO on stage at a sales convention quote ' we need to do something about our 46% annual turnover of BPAs.  If you have a lot of contacts that own small and very successful businesses this could be a great fit for you.  Don't expect any leads you will not get any, especially if you are new.  The model for this organization is to bring in very experienced and polished sales people - pay them a good salary and give them about a year to succeed and at least half quit or get fired in that 1st year.  Why???"
good,"Everyone was very nice and always there to help. I enjoyed learning the different aspects of my job, the company and the products we sold."
good,"I spent almost 14 years with Insperity and I loved the company, the environment and the atmostphere.  "
good,"This was a great company to work for - for the first 2 years. Since the recruiting services is an adjacent business unit, they began being pressed for higher revenue generation. The recruiters were working on a larger desk than is reasonable for proficient productivity and also required to do inside sales for advertising, etc. The increase in requirements were that of multiple roles with no increase in pay for said increase of requirements."
good,"Good place to work for  service  people, very stressful on  the sales side which causes  high turnover. Meeting sales goals is very difficult , sometimes  not possible,"
good,"Insperity is a good company overall but like most companies there are a few rotten apples in the bunch in terms of co-workers.  The ""good-ole-boy-club"" clicks exist throughout the organization and one is out of luck to end up on one of these teams.  The majority of the company is awesome."
good,"There is to much preference and it does not matter what you do or say, if management does not like you, you will not succeed. Too much work which does not balance the pay."
good,The purpose of Insperity is to offer human resources services to small to mid-size businesses.  The service delivered is exceptional.  It sets Insperity apart from any other competitor.  Employees are proud to say they work for Insperity.
good,"Most of the employees there are very nice and friendly, but there is a notion of whether or not you will make it already being passed around. They try to help you but assume you will not last. Very comeptitive and micro-managerial environment. Lots and lots of turnover. It is expected as it is a sales office."
good,"The workload was fine in the beginning, but in less than a year the whole outlook of the company changed. Every week there were new demands that were impossible to match. In the end, the company advised they were relocating (an hour away) and would not be offering full time positions nor an increase in pay."
good,"Near the end of my employment there was a lot of manipulation in the workplace. The environment changed once we were told we would be relocating to the compound at the corporate location. Few excellent managers, quite a bit of harsh managers. Wasn't excruciating, but it was stressful."
good,It was part time but was very comfortable to work with management. It was very organize when I got to work and very clear what was my duties for that day. cleaning and collecting garbage from a big complex.
good,PEO is a good idea that fits with certain employers but not all.  Cold calling to assess best candidates.  Short sales cycle either it fits or it doesn't.
good,"Due to this employer, I chose to move on from the medical billing field to the Accounting field. I know I am greater than the sum on all my parts. I enjoyed meeting and working with the patients and staff within the doctors' office."
good,The company treats you well however it's extremely challenging to find a fit for their core product. Their turnover is like 80% after 2 years.
good,There is worklife balance.  The compensations and benefits are good. There is a nice job culture. The employees are pleasant.
good,Insperity is a solid company.  The services Insperity provides are valued by their clients. 
good,"You can work very independently; ideally you work for a manager who has been successful selling the service, as it's complex, and the manager will determine your success. There was a small percentage of people who were successful who remained with the company, and it seemed they received 'help' to continue their success. I think the company needs each office to be run as its own company; too much big brother/ corporate stuff that doesn't always translate in your region."
good,"Very busy each day as far helping customers with problems, questions and concerns about their solar project. I learn about how solar works and how it is important these days. Also how it will help consistently lower a home owner's bill over time and stay cheaper. Consistently making sure every customer is happy and satisfied with their solar experience. When I was able to solve a customer problems or issues that had been unsolved for a period of more than a few days."
good,If you want to manage ALL aspects of a sales process but with high demands then this may be the job for you.  The highest earner with 15+ years internal sales experience received over a million dollars in compensation.  Clearly with this kind of earning potential requires a very special person that fits the company needs in a very special way but you never know if it might be you.  Be ready for an intense experience.
good,All in all the company is a great place to learn and earn good money; however my property was a transition and my training was videos mostly there were a lot to get through while managing the property without any support staff. you definitely earn the money that you make with this company. I believe if I had gotten hired under different circumstances it may have been a better experience.
good,My work tends to repeat itself. The company gives me 2 or more work from home days per week. This gives me the flexibility to complete my work the same way I would at the office and see my children sooner and more often.
good,The business and financial model made it very difficult to sale the product in my market. In 5 years the organization went through 3 managers of our office.
good,Insperity has a great company culture that makes it easier for their employees to balance work/life.
good,100% Self-sourced prospecting. Consultative/ value development sales. Interesting business model. Poor management placement.
good,"I enjoyed working with my hands - but the volume requirements were not something I had ever worked with before. The Managers were generally very even tempered and patient, I just couldn't meet their volume requirements."
good,Nothing bad to say. It's a great company to work for if you are entry level. I'm middle level and I feel it lacks the ability for me to progress in my career as well as the company.
good,"I enjoyed the time that I worked for med fusion as Front Desk Administrative Assistant. I enjoyed greeting the employees each day and some of the employees even made it a game or challenge to see if they could greet me before I was able to greet them. Several of the employees and rotating students told me that they looked forward to coming into the building and hearing my greeting and seeing my smile each day. I answered the incoming calls for the main phone line and directed the calls as needed or gave directions to our facility to callers as needed.  I really enjoyed the time that I spent working at the Front Desk and being the ""official med fusion greeter"".  I started with med fusion when the company was just starting out (I was the 13th employee hired) and I saw the company grow and felt that I was growing with it.  During the start-up phase, I helped in various departments setting up files and bringing some organization to that position.  The start-up managers and executives were great to work with because of their excitement of seeing their dreams for the company take shape and actually begin happening.  Their excitement was contagious and I began to enjoy seeing their dreams come true as well.  The hardest part of the job was when I was laid off and escorted from the building.  I felt as if I was losing a part of me and my family and I was seeing my dreams crumble."
good,They talk about culture but there is a lack of trust at the higher levels. Its all smiles but behind your back they check they sneak around and talk about you.
good,coordinated obtaining authorizations for physicians and diagnostic centers...very fast paced and every day i would try to beat the amount of authorizations that i would obtain the day before...the hardest part of the job was trying to get authorizations from the insurance companies...
good,Insperity is the company that sponsors Access veterinary emergency specialty hospital in Woodland Hills California. This hospital is a 24/7 critical care animal hospital that is fast paced and provides a great learning environment for anyone interested in the field. Animal medicine is damanding and challenging and can be stressful at times. Anyone interested would need to be fully dedicated to the field.
good,"The hours of this Virginia Paint Company are convenient; it is easy to balance work and home. Our location deals with about 85% of contractors that know what they want and want you to have it all ready for them when they get there. The other 15% are retail customers that love to bring in samples of their fabrics, counter tops, cabinets, and flooring to better coordinate color pallets. I have learned quite a bit about wallpaper and decorating. We truly sell the best paint in town. I have personally worked with a few specialty products so I could better advise the customer on the process of refinishing cabinets or furniture. There are five employees, including myself. I am one of two women. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the disrespectful sexist contractors that make me feel like I am not capable of anything other than being ""pretty"". My favorite part of working at the Virginia Paint Company is my coworkers; because there are only five of us, we are close and love to bring in fresh baked goodies from home and share recipes."
good,"Insperity is a great company with excellent benefits and provides a great work life balance. They encourage you to volunteer, and even allow evtra time every quarter to do so. Recruiting is a mess, new and struggling as they convert to a paid for service."
good,They are not really there for employees more for their client which is the employer.  It is a human resources company that handles everything from payroll to compliance with the law.
good,"Collections of accounts in  early and late stages to offset delinquencies.  Typical collections atmosphere, a great place to work if you are looking for a start up environment."
good,You must have a current referral network for PEO when working here or you will not be successful
good,"called insurance companies to obtain authorizations for diagnostic testing...reviewed clinical information with nurses to justify an authorization...very challenging...most enjoyable part is at the end of the day all of the patient were able to have their tests...as far as my supervisor very poor, never came to work and there was no structure..."
good,"A typical day at this company is full of its ups and it downs so I learned very quickly how to ride the waves of an online based business. The co-workers there are very helpful and willing to offer a hand when available. The hardest part of the job that I found was when something completely out our hands (internet, server or third party based) went down and i could not assist the customers. The most enjoyable would be being able to fix an issue for an angry customer so that they leave with a better taste in there mouth about the company than when they first came to us."
good,"Its straightforward, you come in, go over emails, work on reports and submit them with in the first half of your shift. The second half of your shift you go over files and paperwork and handle in take, and clients who come in. You communicate with other offices by email and make sure appropriate paperwork is uploaded."
good,"This is a good people focused organization.  As with any service provider, service delivery teams can vary in skill and effectiveness."
good,"Insperity is a great company.   I enjoy working at Insperity, because of its people.   There, you are truly family."
good,"Great hours, and flexibility. I confirm and verify coverage and benefits for healthcare coverage. I process and submit autorizations for office visit and office out patient procedures; maintain suppliy inventory. Data entry, demographic logs, reports on forcasting the amount of petients coming into the clinic."
good,"I verify healthcare coverage and eligibilty for new and existing patients, for office visits. On a typical day we see 100-250 patients within our clinic. I provide great customer service to our patients and assure they are receiving the best care while in the clinic. I also process and submit office procedures and authorizations, check-in and out patients, and collect payments due at the time of service. We maintain and find new ways to produce revenue while providing excellent customer service."
good,Insperity's mission is to help business succeed so communities prosper which aligns with my passion. Being a people and customer relations-oriented individual and having a genuine interest in helping others has led me to a career of building strong relationships and helping my clients increase profits.
good,Insperity as a whole is a great company to work for.  The work/family life is great.  They are leaders in the PEO industry and the company is growing by leaps and bounds.
good,Company has great benefits and tries it’s best to promote from within. The people are great and are the biggest reason why they succeed as a company. Their employees go out of their way to please each client no matter how much struggle it is for them as an  employee
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing how much help I give my clients and how much our company is willing to do for them. We really go the extra mile.
good,Great managers and co-workers. Very nice work environment and good work life balance. Just wish they had more jobs to work on. Great clients to work with very professional and polite on every customer interaction.
good,Always change going on in the recruiting area.  I was told the rest of the company is great but recruiting can't decide if they are corporate style recruiting or agency recruiting.
good,I was able to handle my own customer accounts and manage recruiting projects for them.  I was encouraged to take initiative to make every effort to please the customer.  Everyone was quite pleasant and someone was always there to help out.
good,"Very standardized, tried and true approach to building the business.  Excellent training."
good,Great place to work. Great management team. Benefits are pretty good. They give back to the community through out the year. They are very concerned with customer satisfaction. .
good,The company's ownership and senior leadership are outstanding.    The work/life balance and pay are the best I have experienced.  Their level of community involvement and 'giving back' is hard to find.  I am proud to work for this company.  Managers empower employees.
good,"As a Business Performance Advisor in sales, the job is very demanding and the sales cycle is long. Though the products and services offers a quality solution, the work load on the front end of the sales process can be daunting. There is no sales support which means instead of spending time selling, you are buried in tactical admin and time consuming data gathering and data entry to develop a proposal."
good,"This is a great company.  The culture is that of a family.  They keep the employees in the loop.  There are always events going on the keep the staff motivated and feel appreciated.  The company has a big volunteer boost and presence in the community."
good,Typical client facing support job. Casual working environment. Low level of supervision as long as you perform well. 
good,"I love my co-workers! They are like extended family! I have daily responsibilities and love how at the same time new things come up that are not in my job description. I am the type of person who when given a task will accomplish, complete it regardless of titles. I am a team player!"
good,"Managing employees, daily inventory of supplies, managing center accounts"
good,"The company has a great culture and really look out for their employees. Free lunches, fun activities to keep everyone engaged, movie days which are awesome, and one big family."
good,"Insperity offers a wonderful service to small and medium size businesses.  "
good,Well paid position for the work that we did. Management was great. The only downside was the repetitiveness of the work. Was rewarding to help patients.
good,"Overall, a good experience.  The best part of the job is spirit of the the special people that I worked with; hardworking, competent always happy to help."
good,"The team at Insperity are intelligent industry professionals that are constantly striving to make client run better, grow faster and be better employers."
good,Insperity is the Premier PEO offering best-in-class client services. No other PEO compares in the areas of customer service and expertise and this is what we strive for. Upper Mgmt is a bit of an old boy's club but they are generally good to the employees and want to do the right thing. The company and my manager allow me to do what I do best and practice my profession (HR consulting) with minimal interference and micro management.
good,"Work is always challenging and never a dull moment! With clients all over the US, there is always a new law or regulation to learn. Helping clients start up a business is a great feeling and also a challenge. It is also a challenge when a company is at the end of operations, making sure that all employees have been notified and all items have been accomplished. Rewarding work."
good,Great Company to work for. A little cheap to pay great works for growth within the company and reaching company goals.
good,I liked my job and my manager and the people were great to work with.
good,Insperity is an overall good company with a great work/life balance.
good,I enjoyed my time at Insperity. Great company and culture with good compensation.  They give you time to ramp up but aren't afraid to cut people loose if they don't make sales or show growth.
good,this company only served as our HR.  i dont have any way to rate insperity other than to say they met all of my hr needs.  logging into their site was easy and i had access to all the documents i needed
good,Insperity is a valuable resource for individual employees and mid-size companies offering many resources and benefits.

good,"Insperity is a great company to work with. The staff is friendly,helpful and knowledgeable.  The benefits are great.  Insperity provides electronic pay check information, discount on retail facilities.  They are easy to contact.  They match well your work experience, skills and needs with employers."

good,"I have been with Insperity about 6 years.  Made the mistake of leaving and came back.  Management is great, my team is fantastic.  Things are always changing but I think it's for the better."
good,"- Great work / life balance"
good,"I worked at Eclypse International and we were leased employees from Insperity.  Insperity was our Professional Employer Organization.  They are really nice, helpful, friendly people who did all the management of payroll, taxes, reports, workers' compensation, and all other aspects for Eclypse.  I enjoyed working at Eclypse very much and enjoyed interfacing with Insperity very much."
good,Awesome coworkers and managers. Drivers were awarded gas cards for working every 20 hours. Free lunch for those who came in to work on Saturdays. Worked in groups which helped get through the day.
good,"Great people make it a nice company to work for.  A lot of cold calling and networking.  Bundled solutions selling.  You had to sell the bundle or nothing, which makes it a tough sell."
good,Working for Insperity is great because you learn something new everyday.  Management is open to new ideas and you get support from everyone in the office. My co-workers are the ones that make this a fun job.
good,"Supported two family law attorneys; creating correspondence and pleadings; propounding and responding to discovery; communicating with clients, attorneys, experts, and court officers; transcribing dictation; trial preparation; detailed Abacus calendaring; client files and case management."

good,Great culture and opportunities for advancement. The servant leadership culture inspires others to do better every day.
good,"I worked at Insperity on a 6 months contract. The place is stress free and the people there are great. I wished so much they were able to retain me from contract temporary employee to full time direct hire. If given the opportunity, I would definitely go back."
good,"Was a very nice place to work.  A lot of tenured people that knew the industry.  Unfortunately some miss-management and a poor acquisition decision caused sales to nose-dive, which is the reason for my depature (lay-off)."
good,"I enjoy working for Insperity.  They provide great benefits and compensation and truly understand the need for work/life balance which is important.  I interact with sales people, HR generalists and clients on a daily basis which provides for a wide and varied work day."
good,Not an org with fast career progression but great for beginning & end of career needs. Client services teams are the best and most creative! Overall the culture is fabulous-completely lives out the values & mission. If you want to have & see the impact of you work the work for Insperity.
good,"I enjoyed working here, but there was not any room for me to grow.  The company is growing very fast, but in my market there was not any further career opportunities."
good,"Overall a great place to work. Pay and benefits are solid, advancement is always there. I wouldn't change much about anything."
good,"Great staff, hard job but rewarding when you can help small companies with the complicated Healthcare , Worker Comp and day to day activities"
good,My current position offers flexibility and opportunity to grow personally and professionally. Working with clients to manage our relationship and being the primary resource is very satisfying. Working in a team environment also adds to a positive environment.
good,"I couldn't recommend Insperity enough. Great company, great benefits, great culture. Be ready to bust your butt, but honestly, you won't mind. It was an absolute pleasure to work here."
good,"I was in a sales/new business role with Insperity.  I found the overall culture to be positive and supportive.  It's not an easy product to sell at all, but the company provides good training and management is there to help you along the way."
good,"Very fast paced job, working with C-Level Executives in building the foundations of their company.  Working with many different entities (internally & externally) to ensure client organizations achieve their business vision, mission & values; helping growing companies meet new challenges as they advance through their growth cycle.  The hardest part of this job is staying focused on finding the right fit for our platform (i.e.) companies that truly value, and are willing to invest, in their employees.   The most enjoyable part of the job is the team you get to work with, and the success our clients' achieve."

good,Excellent company. Great culture. Team environment with a collaborative effort from DM to corporate support. They give you all the training and tools to succeed.
good,The job was great until someone bought the company and they didn’t want to deal with the United States no more I was able to grow through the company we have to hit 90 bpm
good,This is a great company to work for. Very flexible and family oriented. I'm going on 3 years and don't see myself working for another employer. They truly care about their employees and value our feedback.
good,"Can't say enough good things about the culture, total experience, camaraderie,and caring environment in not only our office but throughout the company nationwide."
good,This is a hunter role for the company and like that role would suggest you are required to get in front of business owners and provide a consultant level approach to their business needs.
good,"I learned scanning, statement processing, running the mail machine and various forms of loan servicing. The most enjoyable part of my job was an unlimited amount of learning possibilities. A typical day at Sabal was scanning loan documents, reviewing and mailing out monthly loan statements. As well as posting loan billing invoices."
good,"I still work for Insperity and enjoy every minute of it. Insperity offers great work/ life balance and genuinely cares about their employees."

good,"It's a fantastic company with stellar leadership. Wish I could've stayed.  The company is progressive and really invests in its peope. "
good,"I started as a seasonal data entry coordinator. I showed some initiative with some Excel sheets, and my supervisor provided me with more challenges. I quickly fell in love with the culture, and I am not alone. With an average retention of over ten years, this is the kind of company to nest your goals."
