rating,review
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,The company doesn't care the workers they just care bout themselves no proper training need to an brown nose in order to move up and be able to get acknowledgement
bad,"Do yourself a favor, and work anywhere else. Go dig ditches before you work here. The pay sucks, the labor sucks, the turnover sucks, the policies suck, they don’t look after long term employees and instead baby and cradle new employees. Will lie to your face so you hear what you want to hear. This place will do anything for an *** in that seat! Stay far away from this place, the drama is not worth it. There’s also a blonde that works in the back and she’ll hit anybody."
bad,"Brinks will hire you at a higher pay rate to get you to accept the job, then have you do things that are not your job, I.e. hire you as a Driver and have you work as a Messenger, for driver pay. Then after a few months they will come and threaten you and lower your pay. When you do a what they want, they will set up to fire you. If you are a female, forget it. Men are favored."
bad,Horrible place to work. Poor management and lazy coworkers. Extremely difficult to request days off. There was favoritism between managers and colleagues.
bad,Poor culture and retention policies. High turn over of management personnel. No centralized policies and procedures. Poor leadership with top down management style.
bad,"After moving to Atlanta I took the first job I could get, just my luck it was Brinks. The job itself is not bad but the management and pay are horrible. Management played favoritism and worked you like a dog for chump change. They did not care about your home life ever. The set up for this company is horrible and I honestly don't know how people can work there for over a year the pay is not worth it, you have to work at least 15 hours in overtime to make any type of money."
bad,"Great work environment and fun people to work with, fun team, outings outside of work, amazing boss and I loved working in there, was laid off due to lack of work."
bad,They have no sense of communication or work help. If you call in the work load is dependent on who else is there. Favoritisms is truth. You can’t leave until the work ALL work is done and if you think you can leave early because our work is done think again cause they will give you something else to do. Don’t schedule anything during your work days because you won’t be able to do it!!!
bad,"Criminally underpaid for the amount of work they expect. No support from corporate or any level of supervision. Will cut your throat in a second. They also have a knack for mistreating and not caring if they keep customers or not. They also have lowered the level of safety for employees. I.e. firing of an employee for getting robbed at gunpoint, when their new procedure policies caused said robberies."
bad,"huge things go under the radar, huge liability, and lies . the managers throw you under the bus for problems they cost you. the managers flirt too much as well"
bad,Theres no comunication and its not work life balance its not worth putting life on for and they over work the employees and they dont have respect the emplyees
bad,"You get delayed your start time, management finds a way to screw you over PTO and your schedule. End up being leaving base late and coming back late close to midnight. You get in trouble for finishing your day early even though you did all your stops."
bad,Brink's company doesn't care about you one bit all they're worried about is making money they put people in Risk lack of leadership the right hand don't know what the left hand is doing
bad,"Poorly managed & underpaid. They want you to carry a pistol & protect the money, but you can’t even pay rent!"
bad,The job was good pay but the work environment was very hostile I wasn’t expecting the job to be so time consuming. In the future I’ll be looking for  job with a set schedule and better pay
bad,"Initial everyone is gung ho and nice. Once you are employeed, you find that management is unfair, inconsistent and only looking to hire their friends from old jobs."
bad,"All the trucks are one person truck, They brake down all the time, none of the management staff care about your safety. People quit almost everyday. Is not a happy place to work"
bad,"Retaliation at its finest, get lied to all the time and put in terrible work conditions with terrible trucks and management does not take accountability. Pretty sad because they were cool at first but were quick to throw you under the bus for anything"
bad,"Worst company to work inn"
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,Good job if you want a lot of OT and long working hours. For those with families and other obligations with life- It's not recommended as flexibility is not one of their strong suits.
bad,This company was absolutely the worst I have every worked for they treat you like a slave 16 plus hours every day you get no break just continue to work until ur mentally and physically drained the management was a joke don’t due it not worth it
bad,"The worst place I have ever worked the manager is extremely rude and the leads are ghetto and childish, all they do is talk about people, very unprofessional, the work life balance is ridiculous you work 12 hours or more a day and the pay does not match the work"
bad,"One of the worst jobs I ever had. Bad management, bad pay, not enough hours. Management does not treat their employees fairly. DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY."
bad,"Very stressful, long hours and very little time off. They work you like a slave and want you to do the impossible on a daily basis. Very poor management.they have no idea on how to run it anymore."
bad,"they expect you to work 16 + hours a day with no rest . Be careful i do not reccomend you to work here unless your  desperate .the pay is horrible , it’s honestly not worth your sanity . They have a rule that’s a no end time rule which is ridiculous. If you come in at 8 am and they wanna give you more work you stay til 8 am . Your check will be horrible with 70+ hrs ."
bad,Poor Management and Back Stabbing co-workers.......Get ready to working like a dog and listen to complaints and bickering from fellow employees and everyday nagging about your driving from constant audio and video monitoring!!! Don’t waste your life in this job!!!!
bad,Unless you want to be lied to or to be thrown under the bus I would not work here. They dont care what you have to say you cant defend yourself because they wont let you.
bad,Management very poor vendictive unprofessional show favoritism. Turn over rate is high co workers dont work together .company seems to be ok managers are the issue until that's addressed  more people will leave because they dont treat us with value...
bad,"Poor Management"
bad,"They never gave me an end time for my shift only a start time. You could not leave until all deposit bags they give you are done and once you finish theyll give you more. I would work from 6am-8pm mon-fri and only got a 30min break. When i took longer breaks, i was threatened with termination. Such a dissappointment."
bad,This was my first job after getting out of the army. My experience with the company was terrible. There was no organization outside of a handful of co-workers who were not in management. The company preferred to hire management from outside the company. Several employees quit during my 4 month tenure with the company.
bad,I caught depression from being harassed and bullied. The management in the company was the worst management ever. They do not care about there workers. I worked there for 2 and a half years and it turned out to be the worst job I ever had.
bad,"-Management sucks"
bad,"first off the pay is okay but they DONT tell you that you only will be paid time and a half for 10 hours which means anything after 50 hours is straight time pay. the drivers have it hard. you arrive at 7 a.m.and your not ready to start the route till 8-9 a.m. which means you just wasted an hour that you could have been delivering money due to the incompetance of management having things prepped, and my typical clock out time was 10 p.m. . the bullet proof vests arent really bulletproff they lie to you about the grade of equipment provided. they told me it it was 3a+ except it felt like pancakes with insolation so tbh its just there to make you FEEL safe not actually save your life... in other words to make this short if you love yourself, your time, and or your family then dont work here cos you will either lose your own life or lose your family due to your absence"
bad,Durante tiempos que estuve me sirvió como escuela básica del conocimiento de la forma de trabajó de las entidades financieras
bad,"I regret taking a job at Brinks.  I worked in the Finance department.  I dealt with the Accounting team.  I toiled from dawn to dusk, and the management was never satisfied.  Even Director-level employees wonder why it is normal that people work 14 hour days.  I left Brinks to save my health.  If you are not management level, and you do not negotiate a bonus, you will not get one.  Management will not help you when you are swamped.  They will blame your poor planning skills.  The work will pile on, so pace yourself and work a steady 60 hour weeks.  They do not believe in breaks, even though they take at least one or 2 hours for lunch, while you stay in and work through lunch.  There is a young woman who wears a uniform everyday -- just let her know anything, and she will gossip to everyone within the hour.  There is no privacy.  Your manager will ask what you are doing, and check your computer screen every 10 minutes."
bad,Don’t do it anyone gets pays better than brinks 15$ hr it’s not worth ur life they will over work u till u can’t no more the are ur friends till u can’t do something no more  management don’t care about u all the care is that the truck is on route long days long hrs and they don’t pay OT after 50 hrs very unorganized
bad,8 year employment ending up in $15/hr. Pay is horrible but the worse part is the management.  They preach about safety but in reality could care less . How is hauling around millions in an armored truck by yourself safe? Typical day is 10 -12 hours and risking your life for $12/hr
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,After coming back from maternity leave the second interview was more about him than what changed with the company. He seemed full of himself and started doing things that made you question why you are at this company. It is a complete lie when they say there is room for advancement. The employees who are qualified are overlooked and the ones who are selected are overworked.
bad,"overworked under paid, management doesnt care at all. Work from 6am to sometimes 9pm, no overtime after 50hrs. Corporation doesnt have a clue about local activity. Very shady company"
bad,"No set schedule. You could work a 14 hour day, not leave until 8pm and be expected to be back the next day at 5:30 am, just to work another 12-14 hour day in a truck that doesn't have AC only to get 10 hours of overtime pay-nothing more."
bad,They have FAKE schedules with start times and Fake end times. Mandatory daily overtime which is illegal in MI. You can't leave until they say so which means u will work 10-14 hours daily. How does that work if you have kids? It doesn't!!
bad,Brinks bought the company I worked for and ever since then it has been horrible. Management is not great. The company doesn’t care about their employees. Do not work for this company!
bad,"The girls were loud and extremely unprofessional. I lasted a week. I was so excited about working for brinks but once I seen how the managers let those girls run the place I was out! No real training,no structure, and those girls were just loud and raunchy so I left because it seems like management did not care."
bad,They are not organized at all and the entire branch is underpaid for the work everyone has to do. Especially the ppl who are risking their lives outside of the branch everyday  the money they offer is not worth your life
bad,"You are Over worked   with very low pay,  dirty environment "
bad,"At Brinks you are overworked with no appreciation for your efforts.  Their Management is very uncoordinated and lacks respect for their employees. Safety was never a priority for their employees.  Your earnings are across the board according to time put in rather then work ethics, skills or dedication to the job.  Time off was never guaranteed.  You are treated as a number and never as an employee."
bad,"Brinks was a company that many people looked to because the name carried a perceived good reputation. However, the location that I worked for in Chicago IL was everything but worthy of a dedicated employee that was looking to move forward in a career. This place is only a pit stop. No long term opportunities. No advancement opportunity. No  investing in employees."
bad,In the time I've been a Messenger for this company I've never seen so much Management incompetence and personal risk to the employees anywhere I've previously worked.  The branch I'm currently with did a morale survey that was 60% lower than a similar  survey done the year before.  DO NOT APPLY WITH BRINKS!
bad,You only get 5 hours of overtime pay everything else is straight time. They tell you that you different when you get hired on. No chance of advancement. No organization on routes
bad,"DVP quick to place blame on management "
bad,"Brinks has the potential to be a great company, however its management and the higher up that make the company a horrible and miserable place to work at. They treat the employees like slaves and don't care about their safety or well being. The training is lousy, and the equipment and trucks are terrible."
bad,Brinks is an awful company to.work for.  Expectations for perfection are high but the compensation is low.  No career development.  12+ hour days are common.  No set end time.  The only person with set hours is the man who runs the place. Very negative work environment.  Filthy. The people who set the rules/guidelines have never set foot in a teller's shoes.  Red squares green is the motto.  Hateful hateful people!
bad,Job itself very simple. Complicated part was the environment. Management is very unprofessional. Co workers are still in high school some how and only way of making any money is working 60 hours a week. Very easy to get fired. Everyday I struggled to want to be in a work environment this stressful. Salary is the worst 10 cent raise after many years employed. Breaks were a joke 30 minutes for 12 hr shifts.  Nothing is  confidential beginning with Human Resources most unprofessional person there. Everyday was something new. The Environment was worst than any other work place. Overtime wasn’t worth it either. And for the type of labor should get paid more.
bad,They do nothing but harass and bully their employees and management does not do anything about it. They all stab you in the back and talk about you. They are fake.
bad,Do not I repeat do not work at the branch in shreveport louisiana the company is trash and management is most definitely a joke.. They all are back stabbers and fake as ever..Dont waste your time applying trust me and the person they have in charge now is very unexperience and unprofessional
bad,"This company will hire anyone as long as they get to give them low pay. They make it very clear you are replaceable. "
bad,Just sucks disrespectful management who plays politics and favotisim and they lie about career advances and management also makes up rules on the fly just to get the work done
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,"They only pay 10 hours of overtime a check no matter how much you work. They have multiple law suits against them for unpaid overtime by employees. They don't care about your safety, just about getting customers serviced and getting corporate numbers up. If your robbed and you survive expect to get on another truck same day and complete your route. Your just a replaceable person and they don't care."
bad,Brinks is the Worst! Work/life balance is horrible! They don't care about their employees and if they have a life outside of work. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at Brinks!
bad,"Over works it’s employees treats the hard working employees horriblely lets the employees slack but then it comes back on everyone doesn’t correct the behavior.It’s no set time off you get off of work when the work is done so it’s no telling what time that will be it’s a horrible company it needs a lot of work. The name brinks you would think it’s Professional easy going environment no it’s very stressful, your over worked, not enough pay, not so nice attitudes, poor management, also always under staffed so your working long hours doing triple the work because of money processing has a dead line because of contract with customers. I thought getting hired with this company meant something but no it’s just another company that can care less about its employees very disappointed with the company as a whole."
bad,"There is a reason this company constantly gets one star from everyone. The managers are unprofessional, nitpicking and unqualified. They make up ""company"" policies that  suits them and break them when they want to. Their is no team work involved. You do have vacation time but cannot take it when you need it, even if you ask in advance. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursdays are too busy so no time off is allowed. No firearm training for employees only for managers who don't need it. Constant negativity. You CANNOT YAWN or RUB YOUR BEARD while driving or you get written up. You don't get 30 minutes break while driving 8 hours. Extremely high turnover. I could go on and on..."
bad,"I was on training and the lady who trained me, she was very concerned of why I was going to be trained on two different departments. I guess since she is going to be stuck in the same department forever. You can just see the envy on this person. She also wanted me to entered information that, she had done for over a year and expected me to learned in 30 mins. I got bad review from her of course. The assistant manager or someone who that as I was leaving the place, he made a comment to come back when they get busy, which he was making a joke out of it. Not even, they can have their job back.  I will definitely get something way better. At least I pray that I will not get people like her on my next job, I hope."
bad,Brinks does not pay enough for the work that you do. Trucks are always breaking down AC or heat doesn't work most of the time. Management is rude and ungreatful. They punish people for other peoples screw ups. Takes a long time to advance. Just an all out bad company to work for.
bad,"Management only promotes those that suck up to management.  Pay is low and they treat this place like the military.  You cannot ever be even 1 minute late.  Management do not take your advice.  The harder you work, the less work those around you conduct and get paid the same as you."
bad,Manager allowed long time employees to manage for her. Crummy work environment little business ethics unsafe to work as an armed employee for 12 hours a day
bad,"Poor management, beyond rude and imature employees who have no cooth. No ventilation at all and a very dirty and unhealthy environment. No PTO. Managers don't care about your safety or wellbeing."
bad,"They work 16 , 18 hours a day or more. There is n rest time you work 8:30 am to 2 & 3 am and they still expect you to come in the next day at 8:30 am . The job you apply for and get hire for you might do that 1 day and the next your doing something else. Their always changing up the process and each time its for the worst. The management has no compassion o sympathy"
bad,I wouldn’t recommend this place unless you mind your business and just come in to work and go home.!The drama is not worth it. They don’t appreciate their employees at all! Run as fast as you can!!
bad,Your at work from 10 in the morning to10 at night. At work all day. You only get the weekends off. The pay does not match the amount of work you put in. Your working two different position and do not get compensated for the two.
bad,"I got paid $13.50 an hour for putting my life on the line every day as you deal with millions of dollars and valuables each day while in the armored truck. I would work from 1 pm to 3 am and then be expected to come in the next day at 9am, very unsafe as I almost fell asleep at the wheel several times. High turnover of employees due to lack of support from management, the salary is very low for such an important job and the fact that your life is on the line everyday since you can get robbed at any time. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND ALMOST LOST MY LIFE AND FAMILY OVER IT. NOT WORTH IT."
bad,Lies from top to bottom.  We Werent trained well and then Was expected to act like a seasoned pro.  The management team was unprofessional and could care if you succeeded or not
bad,"Not guaranteed 8 hours a day, pay definitely suck with all the heavy work and effort you give. They expect you to over work yourself with minimum pay and make you feel like sh-t.. They  do not accept the your efforts at all.Poor management , poor training, and a filthy work environment. Branch manger blame the currency room for too many people which he over hired."
bad,"very stressful place to work at, do not recommend to work here. the pay is not good for the work you do and their yearly raises are 10-18 cents. and they have a big turnaround"
bad,"Don’t work here. Terrible management to terrible supervisors at Brinks Inc. to Brinks Global Services. Once people become supervisors they become high and mighty. Don’t tell anyone about your personal life, they will tell EVERYONE. You work yourself to death. Everyone is lazy! And your fellow co-workers aren’t your friends. They won’t hire you if somebody else has an issue with you. Even though you never worked under them. They bend over backwards for people that up and quit but won’t rehire if they don’t like you."
bad,"Managers do not communicate, in fact they promote non-communication by asking you not to speak to their managers (Directors), and that if you have something to say to a director that they will carry the message. "
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,"Company prefers to hire temps and individuals from overseas as opposed to hire from within.  There is no proper training for a new hire, no control of management, no future, and no raises.  The employees are treated with no respect.  Entire company should be broken down and rebuilt to the right standards of US company policies.  Company is always asking employees for opinions or if they see something say something.  BIG MISTAKE!!!!! You are the first out the door."
bad,"no organization, if anything goes wrong they play the blaming game. must work even if its past 17 hours. terrible job. truck messed. managers talk to you any way and favoritism excises"
bad,Worst company ever. They are always hiring. Because drivers are always leaving. Too many favoritism. When I was there. We tried to form a union. We won. Then Brink’s took the union to court.  Saying they was telling the employee how to vote. Not true. The court ruled for employees to revote. They gave 1-2 month to reorganize. Within that time. Brink’s hired a bunch of people. Gave them gift card for just showing up to work. Brained wash them. Promising them the world. And told them not to vote for the union. We lost. After that I left. And never looked back.
bad,Potential lay off approaching soon. Several rounds of people being laid off makes everyone else fearful of their future employment with the company. Stocks are continuing to decline.
bad,The job was not hard when you have enough staff to work. When we are short staffed it made the work load harder and the days longer. The pay was not good you would have to work with the company 10yrs just to make 13.50 Which it the max pay.  This job is good for a person that's in need of a mon-fri 9-5pm schedule with not other job or school behind it.
bad,"Worked here for 2 years. It has and will be the most dissatisfying place i have ever worked at. With racism going on aswell as constant bullying by not only the boss but alot of the older people. Nothing gets sorted the boss and the PA tend to pull blind eyes to their favourites who usually cause the most havoc within the factory. Hygience is poor with maggots at the chch plant in the bathrooms. dead rats constantly coming up and also in the wee booklets stating theres like 15-20 cameras when there is not. The roofs leak, the health and saftey people they have onboard arent proper and just more brinks workers. they dont get cleaners in or proper maintence repairers infact they be 20 year olds aswell as some office staff. it is literally a joke and not how a factory should be."
bad,"The company pays a low salary.  A human life is worth more than $12.50 to start as a driver.  After 8-10 years with the company, employees are making $18 hr with limited benefits.  Time off request are usually denied because they are understaffed.  Regardless of how far in advance you give them."
bad,"They promise you the world , and they will urinate on your leg and tell you it's raining outside. This is No lie, management is terrible !!  Do not hesitate to contact me for the facts."
bad,Brinks in Mobile al is unprofessional and don’t train very well drivers are lazy management sucks and the pay is horrible I’ll never tell anyone to work there
bad,"Can be long hours, from supervisor to managers to higher ups, they play favorites. Working hard has no impact on if you move up or not. They will hire people who are not qualified and kill morale, which they have done. People are bolting and trying to find new jobs from this sinking ship! People have just been laid off and we know more is to come with how bad management and finances are going! Yikes! "
bad,"Was not able to trust the manager and the procedures. I loved my job however I found myself being lied to after something became missing. I was new in the position and was not properly trained on how to protect myself after dropping money off. Once someone comes behind you, you don't have control over what happens to what your reported."
bad,I worked at the Beaumont Texas Branch. When i began my training...i was mainly a workhorse. I have spent upwards to 16 hours on the road at any given time. The management is lacking. They were brung in from out of state and had no clue about the area or the routes. I started as a messenger and wanted to go to driver. They refused but allowed another person to do it. The pay is very low for this area and low for the risk you take. I do not suggest this for this area. I dont know of other areas. Some equipment was very substandard
bad,"They have no consideration for none of their employees. They make the employees work 6 days straight mandatory, without any notice in advance. They have no good management because of the favoritism that goes on and too due to the fact the managers themselves are OVER worked."
bad,"The worst company I’ve ever worked for the managers are all bestfriends especially the over night manager she’s bestfriends with the lead so they feel impowered to talk to tellers however they want, plenty of tellers brought it to hr and the general manager ofcourse nothing was done about it. You need thick skin working here to handle how they talk to you very disrespectful and ghetto. The work is always heavy because everybody quits and that leaves behind more work. And all the managers and leads are all having inappropriate relationships with guards and guys from the dock"
bad,Loved working at Brinks. But hope you love Brinks more than your family. Worked 60 to 70 hours a week every week. Management would never come to help us.
bad,"This branch runs like your are in a kindergarten classroom!!  The manager is very childish and disrupts the flow of production with her yelling out to employees instead of getting up from her desk and walking to that person. She needs training on how a manager should perform their duties!!  Also, the pay is not what the average cash logistic process should be receiving.  Hard work for minimum pay."
bad,"No communication, no leadership, no structural nor organization and often there is a lack of work in which employees are running around trying to find work to do...."
bad,this is not a good company to work for now. New management is only concerned about saving money and are willing to sacrifice your safety and life to do so.
bad,"I would not recommend this company at all, everything is about the work and they care not about the people doing the work. They will hire you under one role and basically force another job on you with the logic that you will do anything they ask or they will fire you."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,they will set u up the managers stealing money and then they try to blame messengers this is for Atlanta branch 1212 huff road. trust and believe but god don't like ugly
bad,They work you like a slave and are very unappreciative of their hard workers. They overwork the people in their bulk area and make them do more than any other area in the building
bad,This job doesn't pay enough. The amount of work and hours spent doing it is not worth working here. The dont make you feel appreciated for all the work you do. The worst part about working here are the benefits and the hours. You never really know when you get out. You get to leave when the work is done for the day. Thet only ever give you a raise of a few cents every two years.
bad,It's hard to work in a place where they don't value peoples lives as much a they care about keeping investors happy. Benefits kept getting worse every year.
bad,this job is not about you as far as work and life balance. the only great thing is they make sure everyone is secure. pay sucks and doesn't match cost of living. you can't survive off of this pay rate.
bad,lack of professionalism very sad how they treat employees and how unprofessional they are to one another and others calling on phone . when letting someone know how you were being treated it gets blame on you and that is not ethical
bad,The company is only worried about numbers and maki money. To them you a just a face and name and easily replaceable.  And they  don’t pay overtime either. They managed to find some loop hole in the system so they can save some money instead of paying the employees what they actually worked for. I have never heard of that in my entire life.
bad,"It was a really unsafe atmosphere working there, truck were always breaking down, equipment didnt work, they were not following the ODOT requirements at all. they need to fix it fast or it will crumble to the ground"
bad,"Managers don't get sick time and 1 personal day. If you call in sick, you'll fall under a attendance violation and dont look for FMLA to protect your job. Management is very cut throat especially if you are not a part of the in managers circle. Very bad place to work."
bad,Manager had too much favoritism and discrimination. Don't recommend working there.force to work extra hour when they needed after work done they don't  know who you are.
bad,"This is honestly quite possibly the worst place I've ever worked. Most of the entry level managers are on a power trip and think they are above other employees. The top tier managers are even worse, they wont even speak or acknowledge the hard work their employees do. I wont even speak on the working condition while your out there on there road."
bad,"This job was a very stressful job.  I commuted an hour to work here and was always put on the long routes.  My days started at 4 am and, more often than not, I would not come home till around 10 pm.  Management was very disorganized for a security company.  I was never compensated for money spent while training (gas money for an 8-hour drive and food and drinks while i was down there for the week).  Worked there for a couple months and never got my DCJS to carry my gun on the job and did not acquire a work uniform until a little over a month in."
bad,"Nothing is enjoyable about the job especially not management. "
bad,"First off, Do you have a family? if you answer yes and you take a job here kiss them goodbye, because you will hardly ever see them."
bad,The management was horrible. Played favorites and was always flirting with the girls. Worked 12+ hours a day and was never compensated correctly. You're better off working at Meijer.
bad,"Brinks is a place to work if needed but management does not have a clue about anything.  Layoffs are done periodically, if you get a raise they are few and far between so make sure your starting salary allows for that. When layoffs are done the most experience people are let go and more work is left for you to do but no pay increase.  If new associates are hired, you are expected to do your job and train the new associates.  Benefits are ok, 401k is little to none.  I think they match 1.5% now but when I started over 10 years ago it was wonderful.  I would not recommend this place to an enemy and definitely not a friend.  But if you are looking for a place to work join at your own risk."
bad,It's bad when the supervisors never listen to you and always listen to the manager of the dept. Played favorites....... Made you feel worthless.  Never would give you a raise.
bad,"Long hours, on route alone, no one to watch your back. driving and jumping, management sucks, make you drive the trucks with no air, might i add there are no windows to roll down. at gas station and trucks roll when trying to get gas, have to hurry and jump out and put receipt paper behind the tire. i could go on all day .don't get paid overtime. i would not recommend"
bad,Not a good place to work at all.   Work you for little pay and lots of work. Management is no help at all!    Benefits are junk.  Most the trucks have no heat and no ac
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,"Very poor management, no organization at all, LEADS are a joke and if they want someone to be gone they all will try to get you out, if you call out of work everyone knows why which I believe should be confidential, NO work life balance,  they don't care about your personal life they just want the work done, LONG HOURS, very dirty workplace, after a long day of work once you're done you just want to leave but they always find other things to be done so its like your there all day from morning to dark. You also have to ask to leave everyday. very over whelming at times, very high turn over rate people quit all the time, stressful, paid biweekly, only thing is if you need that check you suck it up until you find something else. You'll see. I thought SO MUCH MORE OF THIS COMPANY. Also pay SUCKS FOR THE LABOR ."
bad,Unstable and unsafe working conditions. You will be under paid and over worked. You will work 12 plus hours a day. You will never have an exact time that you get off of work.
bad,"Branch manager is a liar, told me they would switch days working, never did, management staff plays favorite with the staff they like, make it harder for the ones they domt like"
bad,it is a stress job because of robbers we carry money to locations in England  other than that  life is on line and the pay is   bad   but good exp.  its was a job
bad,No overtime regardless of how much you work. They took away profit sharing to lower their financial output. There was never any communication between corporate and there branches. Zero room for improvement. Work with a guy that had been a driver for 20 yrs.
bad,"People that work here are miserable, when you sign out currency, people will snitch on you if you didn't sign your entire name. This is a cut throat company that doesn't care about the employees,"
bad,"if you do not fit in, you are a social outcast. Manager does nothing, supervisor is worthless. They do not take the time to train you. Worst mistake working there."
bad,"No set time to get off, always working 50 plus hours a week manager is a joke branch is going into the hole. always putting in your best and never getting rewarded"
bad,"The place sucked, management sucked. Horrible benefits. Worst company I've ever worked for. Would not wish my worst enemy on that job! Not climate controlled and no set hours so you stay as long as trucks are out."
bad,"There isn't ANY training, you train yourself! They do not have any structure. You only receive verbal warnings before they decide to get rid of you. Bad communication!"
bad,"The management is worst, but coworkers are cooperative. There was too much partiality and friendship favoritism. Not fair management. I would never recomend anyone"
bad,"Poor management, the GM here is racist guy, does not know how to respect lower employee appropriately, act as if emperor."
bad,The management is horrible. Unprofessional and doesn’t care about employees or their life issues nothing is excused with them works you like a slave..
bad,smoky trucks bad management bad equipment. If you value your life do not apply. only work here if you have no other options in life.Moral very low. Managers do not care
bad,I joins the company in 2004 . It was great job then bug now  it's Long hours.  .....A lot of work.  ........Very stressful. .........Poor mangment..  .....Low pay.  .... I regret wasting all that years there.  ..............
bad,"RUN! Worst job I've ever had,this company is a joke, I can't even describe the management, it's disgusting, favoritism is rampant, you are just a number, if you disagree with anything your days are numbered, the good employees are treated like Dogs.no pay raise in 17months, can't think of anything positive."
bad,The company cares more about their work then your safety. I was working long hours usually between 12 to 16 hours a day. company doesn't even pay overtime.
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,Work is easy but Manager and Supervisor give me hard time. I learned so much things for example do not work hard but  make good friendship with manger and supervisor.
bad,The company is very top heavy they do not care about the everyday workers.  The building is old and dirty.  The management doesn't know what they are doing.  no culture
bad,"no advancement avaliable,no growth and the teamwork is horrible as well as the upper management.Job can be very unperofessional at times.I do not recommend this job for anyone with a social life!"
bad,"The worst company I have ever worked for. Low pay, don't care about workers, it is ll about the bottom line. Equipment is not maintained at all. would never work here again."
bad,"you have no end time to when you get off of work, there are petty gossip at the job, no advancement. and management is involved in gossip as well. they don't care if you have this job, they would make you leave then replace you."
bad,While working for Brinks my first year there the company had a turnover ratio of 100 people that were hired and fired. There was no chance for advancement with the company. Management was absolutely horrendous. I applied for a supervisor position. After being there a year. And when I applied I was told it was already going to someone else don't bother applying. The uniforms were constantly dirty. Had to get new uniforms was I getting blood out of a stone.
bad,This place has no order or structure to succeed. If you are not in a position you like there are little option to get out of it. Certain management however will go out of their way to help if you ask
bad,"I started in 2012 and it was not a bad place to work. Decent pay and overtime, i did not feel over worked. In 2013 they cut over time and turnover sky rocketed company wide. Management was always poor. After 2013 it was unreal."
bad,Its ok bad hours. Could not work 12 or more hours everyday. First it was four days work three days off. Then the work overload became to much. So we had to work five days
bad,"Brinks is one of the most unorganized, dysfunctional companies I've ever worked for. The managers have no authority. The HR department is more concerned with keeping troubled employees than backing the general manager and the management staff. The hours suck and the environment is beyond stressful. No one wants to take responsibility for anything that's wrong so they all pass the blame on to different departments. The people are reactive not proactive and if you work hard you get to do everyone's job while they slack off."
bad,"Poor management, low pay! No organization in in route scheduling or directions. I would not recommend this job to anyone who wants to make money in a dangerous job while carrying a gun."
bad,"In the beginning the job was great and I didn't mind coming and doing my job or helping others. Then the changed management and fired alot of good management and now they can't keep people there, new management made working there horrible. The pay is horriable and the benifits are high."
bad,The city manager is falsify information to new hires. There is no set hours. There is balance between home life and work life. Its a dirty environment and there is know team. Some people act like they're bullies.
bad,Worst company I have worked for they were rude and disrectful to employees and talked about them and new hire the management team was horrible They didn't know how to run  their operation
bad,"By far the worst job I have ever had. The environment is what makes it so bad because the job is easy. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians, everyone wants to be in charge and the person in charge has no clue on what to do."
bad,Work/Life balance is horrible. Poor communication with employees.     Benefits are poor. The work load is unrealistic. Job culture is unprofessional..
bad,Treats everyone like scum. Does not care about people's well-being.they don't let you go home for the day until then are done taking advantage of you.
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,"Not a good company, no training, just drive the truck and do not shoot anyone. Everyone that worked there was rude. I woke up at 4am got to work at 5am then had to gps everywhere due to my partner did not want to tell me our next drop."
bad,make sure you are also on time is a big deal to them. Even though it doesn't imply to management. favoritism is also a big thing there! just keep to yourself and offer your help at all. they will take advantage of your kindness
bad,"Please people save yourself the stress and do not work for Brinks. They are the most hypocritical company I have ever seen. In the branch I work for (Fresno) they always try to promote excellence, safety, and security, but they don't care about any of that. People are unprofessional, rude, and lazy. If you're a hard worker, then you will really hate this place. It feels like prison because you work 14 hour days meanwhile the managers take off at a decent time. I seriously believe you should stay away from this company. The pay, benefits, etc is not worth the amount of stress you will get. Enter Brinks at your own risk."
bad,No work/ life balance. Management do not care about their employees. The worst workplace environment ( dirty).The pay is not worth it. Long hours with no cut off time. They don't consider people personal life and health. It's very unorganized. The branch is very unprofessional. They let the Team lead treat the tellers any kind of way. A lot of people come in and quit right after. It's totally not worth it!
bad,Treated very super unfair. No bonus no promises. No AC with crazy heat with machines reaching 270 degrees. No ventalation. Just not a place to be.....
bad,I worked for the company for 11 years and it has never been an end time it was when the work was complete is when you could go home.  There wasn't any training at all with this company.  You have to learn everything on your own.  Upper management did not know how to deal with situations and expected middle management to handle all of the hard work.
bad,"NO work life balance, NO organization, No value in long-term employees with company. "
bad,"This company is by far the worst company I have worked for. The pay is despicable, considering the amount of work you are expected to complete. They do not take into consideration the experience or education you may have. The benefits are awful, vacation is awful and maternity leave there is none!!!"
bad,You are over worked and way under paid.  There is not much of a compensation package and not enough balance between work and home life. Management was lacking in proper management skills.
bad,"No work like balance whatsoever. If you have allergy problems, this company will only make it worse or make you physically ill. No regards to a healthy atmosphere while working with mutilated cash and extreme dust. Management is purely focused on deadlines and treats employees like a number not a person. They automatically enroll you in 401(k) for the company's benefit not yours. I never received my dental and eye benefit package so I was unable to use it although I was paying. You can only clock in within 3 minutes of your starting time, anything after a minute docs you as TARDY. 30 minute lunches, while working 10-12 hr days should be illegal. Only thing cool was getting the private security license which they revoked once I resigned. Employees were very childish and caddy, management did not discipline employees after my currency was stolen even after they had it on tape. I AM STILL WAITING TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER ABOUT THE INCIDENT. Horrible company period."
bad,"There are no advancement opportunities.  If you are a good employee, you will be worked harder.  There is absolutely no consistency with this job and work hours are long and constantly vary from day to day."
bad,The managers have no respect for the employees. They literally treated us as if we were in a sweatshop or jail. They spoke down on us & treated us as if we were beneath them. They're constantly firing people and employees never really stay. They change up hours; either they're forcing you to leave early or they're force to stay and work. The immediate manager is constantly on your back & saying the most inappropriate things I don't even know how he still has a job there! They're obsessed with the customers but could care less about the employees that work there! I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE TO WORK HERE!
bad,"This company is not together, things change everyday. There is no set schedule to when you will get off...They say they care about attendance but people have been late since the day they have started but they will wait until others steal their money and higher management threaten them. I currently work here and seeking new employment"
bad,"I've work for these people for almost 4 years. The month that they were supposed to give me a raised they fired me and making seems like it has something to do with my license. The management over there have no clues about how to run the place. You have no say of what's going on there. If so, you will get fired real quick. Yes I stayed there for that long because I'm very loyal when it comes to my job not for the pay. Talking about paid!!! They work you off 5-6 days in a row. You can't ask for days off unless it's a serious emergency!! I hated everyday going to work at that place."
bad,"Long hours, poor management, and frustrated employees.  Not a place you would want to stay for a long period of time. Moral is low and management doesn't take suggestions from employees."
bad,"Terrible management, no raises, salary for what you're doing is to low, terrible insurance, terrible working conditions, no advancement at all. Brinks is falling apart and losing contracts left and right."
bad,I recommend working here only to receive your gun license. Once you have it don't stay for more than six months to a year. This is by far the worse company I've ever worked for and I've worked for many.
bad,They treat their employees like garbage in 8 months i never received a single lunch break while working 14 hour days they did away with raises and advancement also management lies
bad,"Global logistics company, however they will give you terrible equipment, and management will only promote their friends.  It's the worst excuse for leadership."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,"Poor communication between Mgmt and employees. Uncaring working environment, job main priority and family is a very distant second. Yet, Brinks proclaimed to be a family oriented company, that cares about their employees family. Not paying full hours work, meaning not paying time and a half, when one has worked 20-30 additional hours over 40! No rotating system to be off on weekends, so again family life isn't an concern... No schedule adjustments for those that, work late on their routes (coming in after 9 p.m. and not getting off until 10 p.m.) and need to come in later the next day, causing lack of rest and sleep!!! Unaffordable health insurance. Turnover rate is extremely high, for a company that's so well known and large... Not knowing the mgmt. situation currently but before, very poor mgmt staff."
bad,"Low paying, not a good opportunity move for a career. Co-workers were friendly for the most part. If you enjoy easy work this is the job for you."
bad,"This was the worst job I have ever had. The management is very unprofessional, they want you to ask them what to do when you come in to work. They expect you to work fifteen hour shifts with only a 30 minute lunch break! They're crazy. I resigned within a month."
bad,Work 12-15 hours a day with no overtime.  No set time when you are done for the day.  You are done when all of your assigned stops are done. Management does not care about employees and training is inadequate.
bad,place is  diesgusting they want us to volunteer on saturdays to clean and paint building. they need to get a company in there to clean and fix everything. management stinks. to much drama in currency room and the manager is the top person with the branch manager for drama.
bad,No life balance at all. employees are treated rudely and without justification. Branch manager treats everyone as if beneath her status of what she regards as a Human Being
bad,"Unfortunately working at Brinks in Miami is not the same as it was before.  The management team is unprofessional and disrespectful. Employees are constantly yelled at and threatened with loosing there jobs and you are forced to work 6 days a week with more than  12 hour shifts. Management does not care about your health or saftey, or about the old trucks that constantly break down. I would not recommend this job to anyone.  Stay Away."
bad,Don't care about employee's..your just a number. Only worried about the dollar not the person. People working in the A/C get paid all the over time they work but not the people doing the hardest and most dangerous part of the job. Insurance is stupid expensive and pray you don't have take time off for an injury cause they will bend you in-half and break it off.
bad,"I do not recommend this job to ANYONE!! management is horrible. They are rude, start issues between tellers, and just overall unprofessional. Its hard to have a life working this job. You do anywhere from 60 to 75 hours a week. i became a weekend mom. It is just HORRIBLE."
bad,"Pay sucks for cbl driver and carry gaurd workers,no over time for the workers. The job is not hardbut dangerous, and the most enjoyable part of the day was gpong home period"
bad,"This branch of Brinks is something else. The employees  are very nosy they should learn to mind their own business. All they do is   talk about each other in hopes of making trouble. "
bad,"Full of old people who don't mind their business. Terrible management. Poor working conditions. Under paid,'just everything about this place was bad."
bad,"Work over 60 hours a week, and only get paid 5 hours a week of overtime. Poor management. Trucks always breaking down. Dangerous job."
bad,"A company which doesn’t take into consideration your ideas even if they are brilliant, doesn’t deserve you. They should encourage you to grow because their company will grow and prosper with you as well. They shouldn’t prevent you from improving yourself."
bad,Horrible place to work for. Management is extremely dysfunctional and unorganized. They knowingly put us in dangerous situations every day.
bad,tbis place does nothing but work its employees to the ground. Management is a game. They don't appreciate anything anyone does. Five hours of over time and that's all. Seventy plus hours a week.
bad,"Just horrible, not enough break time. They rush you through your work and are pretty rude. Do not work here unless you really have to."
bad,Magement sucks.  They are never around to help out when needed.  They put a lot of extras on everyone else and there is no compensation or even a thank you
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,"Working for the company was okay. The management though, they do not care about you at all and not about what you have going on in your life to provide for your family. Working for BRINKS they wanted you to just be about them and nothing or nobody else. They did not care about if you had to pick your kid up from daycare or anything. I would not work for them again ever. They wanted you to choose them over your family. NOT a way to run business. Wanted you to work long hours but would not try and get the work done faster throughout the day. Things just were not ran right."
bad,"no raises, not worth it at all, too many cuts over the years, nothing to look forward to, only 5 hours overtime but they still want to work you 60 hours cause their always short staffed...go figure!"
bad,"I enjoy of what I do at work ,everything, you'll always learn something knew with the machines that we handle, and with our customers. The only thing that i don't agree with this company is that they don't know how to keep their employees happy. we all work long hours sometimes even 18 hours in one day and we have to be up the next morning at 5 am even the drivers i really don't feel safe knowing that my driver had a few hours to sleep. also i would really like if they actually payed over time or time in a half. these are some of the reasons why i am looking for a knew job."
bad,"Not a good company to work, low pay and long hours. It is a dangerous job that does not compensate you for your effort. men have to shave daily. Make sure to carry with you a pair of gloves to protect your hands."
bad,Horrible place to work. Management is horrible hrs are not realistic. Work like a slave in bondage. They lied about hrs to be worked. You will come in at 10am and leave 11 or later. Sometimes 2am. Been months and nothing has changed. They definitely take advantage.
bad,"Very fast paced, running money all day, have lifting, count multiple banks cash, run ATM money,etc.process orders for banks, very strenuous job, can be likable, no face-to-face customers."
bad,"management is not up to par. the environment is not clean, healthy nor comfortable. It not a place that I would refer anyone. Benefits are horrible as well."
bad,"A typical day at BRINKS, Inc. consists of long hours with little to gain from them. I have learned that they do not value their employees despite the importance and danger on the job. Management is uncaring towards employees, and they maintain their own profit above employee benefits. My co-workers are one of the few good things on the job, but unfortunately we're all stuck on what seems to be a sinking ship. The hardest part of the job is maintaining your security, awareness and consistent responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the long hours shift is over."
bad,"no room for advancement, people okay but messy. Management didnt know what they were doing."
bad,"Delivering, picking up and reconciling valuables at customer’s location"
bad,Don't waste your time with this company. It use to be a good company but not anymore.  Management and upper management do not have any respect for the truck employees they dog you out and the pay is horrible. Their is no way to make a living in the armor car industry and no where to move up to.
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone.  Overtime is capped to 5 hours no matter how many hours you put in a week.  Benefits have been drastically cut and this company is in serious trouble.
bad,"Cost Control & Expediting of routes, accident investigation profit & loss. Managing of employee to departments to crew of 30 employees. Co worker are great to bring employee to together to work as team. Hardest pat never came for I live by words work smart not hard. Love working with people &  satisfy customers demands & needs to accomplish to goals of business."
bad,"This place is terrible!!! No ot, terrible pay, terrible management, promises broke, no raises, unless u quit n they want u back n they offer u a dollar raise.. crazy right... gi joes wannabes , dont work here trust me ubless they start paying more!"
bad,Friendly co-workers. Job is easy. Management does not pay shift differential for representatives working up to midnight 24/7
bad,"not a place to work"
bad,Our branch manager back when I first started surprised me with a nice Christmas gift. I enjoyed the parking lot picnics we used to have.
bad,Trucks are not secured as advertised and workers are at risk for being shot and injured while in the vehicle. Company values expenses over employee safety.
bad,Very low pay for a dangerous job. Leadership very arrogant and inconsiderate.
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,"Pay is low... they work you like you're a slave. You never know what time you'll be off. And temperature in building is horrible... they run the AC on the second floor where the main boss works, but in the money room and trucks NO AC!! Roaches all over building even in the fridge.... "
bad,"•a typical day at work boring "
bad,"will find reason to get rid of you, constant changings schedule, NO WAY to advance"
bad,Company no longer exists. Was bought out by ADT. Same commission only structure as ADT.
bad,I worked for Brink's for over 6 years. They do not treat their employees well at all. Employees are often fired for little or no reason. Management is often discriminatory in their approval of things like vacation time because they approve one person and deny someone else showing favoritism to their friends.New manager let good people go for no good reason.
bad,"En el inicio del día llegar a que te firme la hoja desde allí corre las horas de trabajo te asignan trabajo como recuento, pagar sueldos en empresas o te mandan a bancos."
bad,"If I could give this company zero stars I would. The management team is terrible, they feel as if it is ok to be disrespectful and degrade employees, but you must respect them. The work/life balance is atrocious, you have no time for yourself or family. They make you feel terrible for asking for time off, they will straight up yell at you for asking for time off."
bad,Absolutely the worst job ever! Would not recommend to anyone even if they were desperate! Management in the Scranton location were very racist but did a great job acting like they weren't! Hated it n they would steal hours from me all the time
bad,Could not keep employees to stay. Constant turnover rate. Always assume you are stealing. Some good guys that work there but most are very grumpy and yell about everything.
bad,"My ""training"" was driving a truck around for someone while they went out and did every thing and I just sat in the truck. One day I was told, ok you'll be going out and doing everything today. They gave me a route that was 3 hours away from the branch and gave me exactly 0 training. I was just told to show up at 6 in the morning and do my route. I had no idea what I was doing. Management wasn't even there yet and when I called them they didn't answer. I have learned everything I have learned on my own. Every time I call and ask management for help they get very annoyed. My immediant manager wont even talk to me any more because he is annoyed with me calling him all the time. I have numerous atms on my route that I have no idea how to do. They are constantly forgetting to give me combos to safes and keys to safes and then get mad at me when I call and tell them I can't do the stop because they screwed up and didn't give me what I probably need to do it. I have been putting in 70 hour weeks and making peanuts because some how they get around the law and dont have to pay over time. They dont teach you anything, work you to the bone, don't pay you enough and get made if you try to learn your job so you can do it properly. It is quiet honestly the worst job I have ever had. I brought home more money delivering pizza part time."
bad,"This company over works you for little pay and there are very slim chances of you ever progressing in there no matter how hard you work. The management is horrible and they only care more for workers that have been employed with them for more than 5-10 years. What I have learned is you can be a pervert, racist, or bias at brinks as long as you've worked there for years. Your job is more at risk than theirs.  My advise is to not give Brinks the time of day."
bad,"The management is horrible they sit around talk about everybody and their business,they put all the work load on the new people so they can sit around and be on the phone .If you don't mind being a slave be my guest and apply.GOOD LUCK. O and if you like to be clean make sure you clean because they do not clean ."
bad,"Horrible management, worst of the worst. Managers are very vindictive, they don't care about their employees. Very unorganized and zero communication between ""leadership."""
bad,Management is careless. They sit around like high school kids and talk all day about the other workers and about everything but work. They add to your work load inconveniently while your in the field and hold you responsible for other people’s obvious mistakes. It’s ridiculous. Wouldn’t recommend wasting your time and energy because you will use ALL your energy and time. Might as well be private security or a security guard.
bad,This company is all about CEO's they dont care about road employees that make the company grow the only pay $11 a hour and $ 1 more to be a one man and be by yourself
bad,"When u work for this company expect to  have no outside life, when u come in Tuesday afternoon  ,u will not leave until your job is done ,with everything u do u won't leave until Wednesday morning. UR shifts will not be 8 hrs apart so don't think you will be seeing much of your children or families,working for this company.also husbands or boyfriends if u have one. UR life will be at brink's .there is no paid overtime n u will be working alot of long days"
bad,"Job sucks..as employees on the trucks ..u cant bring a cooler for your lunch..long hours..low pay..No life outside of work.. one person calls out throws off the whole operation.."
bad,stay away!!!!pay vs work life balance vs management its just not worth it and they ask you to follow the rules and guidelines but as soon as it benefits them them will break those very same rules
bad,"This was probably the worst company I have ever worked for. The management will not stick up for the team that they oversee. Sometimes you worked 15 hours with only a 8 hour turnover time between shifts. There was never a set time for when your shift ended. The branch I worked at was incredibly understaffed.They had a very high turn over rate. The managers never stayed late to help the understaffed team. You were never recognized for your work. If you did something correct, managers often said ""Good. Don't f*** it up next time"". The morale of the branch I worked at was incredibly low."
bad,You start at 8 am until messengers return; which could be at 7 pm or 8pm you never know what time you get off. A lot of favoritism and expected too much for pay.
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,"From top to bottom. Brinks is entirely about stock holders and nothing more. Stock holders do not care who you are, what you need, or what you want. Armored Car industry is a joke in terms of security and financial stability. Brinks is so worried about customer retention City and or Branch Managers are required to bend over backwards at the expense of employees. All these actions do is lead to enabling of customers who wish there demands be met at the burden of armored crews and or office personnel. Management favor do nothing ""supervisors"" who constantly screw up or do not know how to do their own responsibilities. Armored crews are and will constantly be given the short end of the stick in regards to employee hours or work that needs to be done. Armored crews fill in all leftover roles or do other tasks that managers, supervisors, and vault staff are to lazy to do. "
bad,The management staff is incompetent and lazy. HR is there for Brinks not for the employees. If you are looking for a job look else where in NY plenty of poaces hiring with better to offer. Over time is only 5 hours after 40. But the work is an average of 50 hours a week. DONT APPLY. DO NOT APPLY.
bad,Management needs to know all jobs. You can't manage properly if you don't know the job and/or the system.  Pay was terrible. You never start/leave at the time they say you should and no overtime! A lot of conflict of interest going on there. I was there only a short time and in that time 5 people quit.
bad,"The instructor talked very negatively about the company on the 1st day. A lot of the people who work there have been there for years & have built a family bond so you kind of feel like an outsider if you don’t know a familiar face. The little management that lasted for 2 months was pitiful. Was learning a new area & one of the employees was using our work computer to apply for another job. Did the whole assessment that went along with it! A lot of employees are rude, and vulgar language is used in every other sentence.  Manager went MIA after a couple months after being hired & never heard from. No raises. No holiday parties unless employees put it together. No acknowledgement of good work. Barely holidays off. No communication between employees & “management”. Poor organization. They started talking about Saturday’s & I was never mentioned a Saturday in the interview, not when applying. For $11.50 & a gun. It’s not worth it."
bad,Low wages/infrequent raises for what is expected of you. Poor communications.Worn-out equipment..No paid time and half pay after45 hours per week for outside labor employees
bad,"It was a life risking underpaid position.  The management were known to be prejudice and openly displayed preferencial favorative treatment to employees from a specific ethnical background that shouldnt be to hard to identify.  I was being harrassed and when expressed this to HR, they came up with some bs to fire me for."
bad,"Our start time was constantly changed due to upper management trying to micromanage our hours even though it was not our errors causing us to stay extremely late. Upper management treats you like just a number and not a person, says he cares but really doesn't and his actions prove that. The co-workers are good minus the occasional pain in the neck but overall a decently fun crowd. The job is very stressful as you deal with large amounts of money and if any money is even thought to be missing it is your fault until proven innocent."
bad,"The job doesn’t have an ending time. They only give you 1 30 min lunch and 2 15 min breaks when your there sometimes for more than 12 hours. This job really sucks, coworkers attendance affects your work load and hours. Horrible vacation and holiday pay system. Not very understanding and did I mention Management sucks! Nobody knows anything at the branch, most of the bRanches do everything different because there is no type of system or structure."
bad,"The workplace has potential, but right now it's horrible chaotic. Needs new and better management and organization. It's a very stressful environment."
bad,"Aucun n'échange avec notre chef de site, celui-ci n'avait aucun respect de ses ouvriers, aucun savoir-vivre voir même aucunes éducation...parfois même des réflexions machiste et racistes..."
bad,"does not pay over time passed five hours. all equipment doesn't work well which slows you down. bad management, no lunches or breaks unless you bring your own and eat in truck."
bad,Horrible people who care less about you and your life your family or personal safety... This place will say anything to get you in the door. quick to fire also.
bad,"Managers give their workers their workload and do nothing the whole day but watch other people work. upper management changes the way work is done to how they see it being more efficient but really just make things much much harder. they also cut down on workers to make few people do a lot of work and save some money, by far the worst job i have ever had."
bad,They Suck Big Time. Do NOT apply. Worse management ever. Make this company the your last resort. Again They SUCK. Don't Do it.
bad,Worked there for quite some time and the management is horrible. So much favoritism there it's unbelievable. If you're not a suck up or in the clique you get no where. Plus they'll walk all over and stab you in the back. Tampa branch needs to be overhauled.
bad,"This is genuinely the worst place I've ever worked. "
bad,"There is nothing I really want to say about the company. "
bad,"No raises, took away overtime and overtime pay and no chance for career advancement. You would work anywhere between 10 hours to 17 hours a day. Management would never answer your phone calls for questions and the trucks were always breaking down."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,Days are typically 10+ hours. Pay is substandard for the work performed.
bad,"Your hours can and will be cut unexpectedly. If you are injured you will be treated like a criminal. Management will either ignore your recommendations or if they like your recommendations they will tell senior management and claim it as their own. They promise promotions and raises but all we have seen is layoffs and reduction in hours and benefits. Dont get me wrong I loved my first 6 months on the job but once you ask questions about procedure or question why your hours are reduced, you will be treated very poorly. Do not just take my word for it, talk to different employees that have been there longer than a year but less than ten, and they have one thing in common...The fact they are actively searching for another job. And if you are injured on the job you will loose all PTO(paid time off) . You also will not recieve any overtime pay if you are lucky enough to get overtime, or even full time hours for that matter. Also if you are injured on the job their only solution is to put you out to pasture (fire you)."
bad,"I have been here for 5 years.  Hours are either way long, (50 or more a week) or way short (Barely getting full time hours) and unpredictable.  Can never plan events for after work, for you may get off at 3 or 8 pm with no warning.  Minimal advancement opportunities at best."
bad,productive and fun work place great team players most focus management average
bad,Low pay CDL drive for some trucks management dosen't care over the amount of money you can carry per personal driving to and in NYC.
bad,The work is not hard at all but you liking of the job will be a personal preference. Your work ethic will determine if you like the job. There is always work to be completed and you do not go home until the work is completed and put up for the day. You and your co-workers' speed and attitudes at work will determine your experience
bad,The job is not considerate of anything that's going on they only worry about making themselves look good not worried about the employees in their lives they feel that Brink's is the only life that you have
bad,"This job is the epiphany of dead end. The pay was very low, i was averaging between 300 - 400 dollar paychecks each week and that was working up to 6 days a week. Some days i would get in around 7am and be back at the branch by 4pm. Other days i would be in by 7am and wouldn't get back to the branch till 7:30pm. Spending up to 12 hours a day driving their old and very dirty/smelly trucks was unbearable at times. Especially since there are no breaks and have to eat lunch in the trucks. I did meet a few nice people that worked there (but only a few). A majority of people that worked there were either mentally slow, in a really bad spot in their lives and just needed a job, or living with their parents so pay didn't mean much to them. There is no moving up in this company. I was blown away to find out that there were a few people whose been there for 15 plus years and capped out around $16 an hour. Also you're only allowed 10 hours of overtime. Anything over those 10 hours goes back to straight pay. The poor quality of management only makes things worse. You wont know what days you are working that week till late Sunday night when the manager text it to you. So planning to have any sort of work life balance? haha good luck. Stay away from this company and any company like it. They try to suck the life out of their employees for profit. DO NOT WORK HERE. You've been warned."
bad,Its a physical job with no advancement.  Need more improvement with Management.  14-15 hour workdays.  No 10 hour rest rule. back at work early morning at 5am.
bad,This job is not a ideal job for a person that has a family with kids. The pay is not enough the management dont care about your opinion on things and they work you long hours. I make 11.55 a hour and I work from 7am to until work is finish which is normally around 8 or 9 PM. If they paid more money for the work it will be ok.
bad,Do not work here it you need a job security to keep food on your table for your family never know what you will be getting fired for they will just tell you about investigation and then send you a letter tell you that your no longer working there
bad,Terrible management. Atlanta branch has went to slums. Management fires hard working staff members. Then management gets fired for dishonestly. You do the math. It all sounds good. Its really not and very unsafe.
bad,"A lot of managers are very vindictive and would make you work under dangerous conditions at times ,just to get the work done. "
bad,Terrible place if you can find any other job before Brinks please pursue them this job is the worst you get fired for every little single thing everybody has attitude everybody wants to be a boss
bad,As a new hire there was really no one to teach me anything there were people there from out of town and did not know like where it is anything going on what to do and it was Not a good work environment
bad,"Worked for this company for 18 years. It was a great place to work until they started bringing in upper management from outside the company. These managers didn't understand the armored industry. They were only concerned about the numbers, not the people or security procedures. As a result, it is no longer a safe place to work."
bad,"Brinks is selfish company they only think about the bottom line, if management does not like they find something to fired you. I wouldnt recommend it."
bad,"My review for  brink's it to advise no one to really work there it is a unperfessional company you work for so many hours per week and never one day they said thank you I'm talking about 50 60 to 70 hours per week  the conditions we are working under is so sad the manager   and the HR is so worse there is  so many reason I can said about brink's I going to leave unsaid ."
bad,"Overtime is mandatory. Upon hiring you agree to the 42-45 hours per week and after training it gradually is mandatory to work near 50-55 hours. No Work/Life Balance. Not for a person married or single with children. The medical plans are expensive and don't cover most X-rays, MRI's etc. Managers are over-worked and it reflects in their attitudes. Limited training and make your ability to perform inadequate.No job growth. Once in a position its yours. Complaints are not address and can be used against you. Wages don't equate the work load. Environment is dirty, lights to dim and strain the eyes and lunch breaks are half hour. Fifteen minute breaks that most people avoid to be able to keep up with production. You been Fore-warned."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,"over worked, poor pay, long hours, only allowed 15 min break and 30 min lunch with to many hours of work. need to treat employees better. and pay more for hard work. have to stand on feet all day."
bad,This place is horrible if you really need the money then ok but I can  guarantee you won’t be there for long if you are you will be Miserable every employee hates their job management SUCKS the way the company is run SUCKS they don’t really care about your safety only good thing about this place is you don’t have to pay for your commission card. They need to fire every one in management and Greg better yet just throw the whole company away
bad,I have bad experiences with brinks . The have old Armored Trucks zero management bad benefits low pay in bad conditions for working at brinks.if you not portoricain brinks doesn’t give you a chance to work
bad,"This is specific for the Jacksonville location. Manager of cash logistics is very high school child like. Has a clique of people she likes and promotes her clique and treats all others like SCUMB on the bottom of her shoe. Every thing is so unorganized and totally unprofessional. The turn over rate here is at approximately 80% in my opinion. I Notice people quitting left and right.  The pay is horrible for how much liability you are responsible for ( in the millions of dollars). You can work almost anywhere else even in fast food and get payed more and have less stress and drama to go along with it. THIS IS A WARNING TO ALL PEOPLE LOOKING AT WORKING AT BRINKS IN JACKSONVILLE. DO WORK HERE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A STRESSFUL, UNPROFESSIONAL WORKING ENVIRONMENT AND  BE TALKED DOWN TO AND TREATED LIKE GARBAGE AND GET LITTLE IN COMPENSATION FOR IT."
bad,Management is terrible. Paid is worse. How can a company like this not pay well with the amount of stress and work given. They are made out to be great but in reality they dont care about you. If they did they give you more money.
bad,"Pros- well..its a job and you get paid but not alot by a long shot unless $12-$13 is your thing. "
bad,"Don't work here! Please find other employment. Management and supervisors are inconsistent, human resources department is a joke,  there is a lot of nepotism and favoritism amongst some tenured staff and thoee in either position who don't fall in line with other managers, are terminated for otherwise acceptable behaviors."
bad,You will work more hours then they tell you. Your work home life balance is very poor. I found that the pay was not worth the demands for the job. Very stressful
bad,"One pace, full throttle all day and into the night. They will start your day with your first job close to home. As you travel from job to job you will end up far away from home (1-3 hours away). They will only pay you for 30 minutes of that drive home. So every day they send you farther away and you just end up getting home in time to go to bed. Management was poor and often lied to customers after forgetting to add them to the schedule."
bad,"I think brinks under pay their employees. Does not appreciate their employees. I think if you are into warehouse work and you are now starting, maybe brinks might be the place for you."
bad,This place sucks. The management was very terrible at this work place. You can't make any plans for after work because you never know when you'll get off. The pay and benefits don't match the work they have for you.
bad,"Long hours in a confined area, no windows. Lot of favouritism to certain workers. Really hot in summer and really cold in winter. Best part is no weekends or holidays, Pay scale very good."
bad,If you are in desperate need for a job then I say go for it. Mangement is horrible all they want to do is eat and make copies. If you are not one of the “favorites” you don’t matter. The cash room supervisor likes being in control .
bad,"Brinks is a stepping stone in life, or more like a jail sentence. You get in do the time and get out hoping this job helps your resume. Don't expect more, what you see is what you get"
bad,The 6-7 month while employed by brink's started off ok but ended worse. Management could be a lot better than what it is. The benefits could be a lot better as well. I have three kids and the insurance is higher than any company I've worked for.
bad,"management in the Salt Lake branch sucks, they play favoritism, if you aren't willing to bend over and do absolutely anything asked, and give up just about any kind of life outside of work, you won't get anywhere."
bad,"Blind leading the blind in a corporate environment. There were good people there but management was extremely poor, particular within HR.  That place was a revolving door. Every time you look up, someone from HR had been fired or resigned. Poor management and lacked people skills and development."
bad,I do not recommend this company if you have a family because there is no understanding at all for parents with children. Team work is a understatement it is more like every man/women for them self. Everything that is told to you in orientation is not applied to the actual job.
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,"A typical day at Brink's the schedule changes everyday.  If you work 6hours into the day, you receive one 15minute break and no lunch.  I learned its not the place for me.  Its a hostile environment.  Management need schooling on managing  employees.  There's nothing hard about working at Brinks.   They don't provide any training.  The hardest part of the job is getting off at your schedule time.  Your not paid any shift differential and you work Labor Day, which is a holiday.  Not according the Brink's.  There nothing enjoyable about work at Brinks.  There's no room for advancement, unless your a favorite person of management."
bad,a typical day at work is working 10-12 hours a day. If there were communication maybe the workplace would be better. A team is suppose to work together not against one another.
bad,Mismanaged at the top. Corporate initiatives required driving results. If the employees complained HR or an executive from corporate headquarters gets involved to prevent a union from forming. they sent a mixed message.
bad,"Brinks Inc asks you to protect large quantities of money belonging to their customers with your life. It's a corporate business so they only pay 1-2 dollars more then minimum wage at McDonalds. "
bad,Work you to your last drop of energy and then make you come back the next day with poor pay for putting your life on the line for a corporate company.
bad,Its like being in high school .young adults (acting like kids) the mangers. Have no respect for employees. The breaks and not good. And over night employees never make they 40hrs and work all  holidays because most are on monday and they work. From sunday -Thursday
bad,There is only one good manager.  It is a revolving door there.  They train you for about a week then they put you out there on your own.  If you get hired you will be accused of stealing at least once a week.  They will never issue you an apology after they accuse you.  It is just a terrible place to work.
bad,"There is always a constant turnover-even with management.  "
bad,Brinks needs to build a productive culture to drive productive and results. Poorly performing upper management staff. No work life balance and co-workers are seeking other opportunities.
bad,I have never met a company that was so intent on eating it's young. They will lie to you at every opportunity. Abominable management. Deplorable vehicles. You can't be that desperate for a job to work for Brink's.
bad,"Almost all resources were hired in order to implement and support Oracle R12 for LATAM.  The executives did a poor job managing the project and then hired the right people to stabilize the system and complete some of the project.  Once stabilized - most of the resources were let go.  There was a lot of blame on the new resources for the executives and prior resources decision and waste."
bad,"If you have a social life and are married or in a relationship, kiss that goodbye. Your life belongs to Brinks. Working 60+ hours per week, sometimes more due to weather, trucks breaking down, etc. Brinks no longer buys new trucks so you are driving around trucks from 2009 and thats the newer trucks. They are converting to one man vans with no armor so less protection for the employees."
bad,"I worked at the portland branch for 5 years, and I learned a lot. I worked consistent overtime and had almost no time for a personal life. The supervisors and branch manager were all constantly miserable, screaming and throwing things. Treating the employees like workhorses. I worked extremely hard and received only two promotions and for 3 of those years I didn't get a raise. The company does not put their employees first, as they are struggling to stay afloat. There is no such thing as customer service and as there is no HR department in the branch, everyone runs a muck and does whatever they want without consequence."
bad,management was not very understanding of work/life balance issues. It was a very stressful work place from the start and they did not give proper time to learn the job with very little training before threatening a write up about production.
bad,"Brink's is a horrible place to work. In the two years I have worked there, we the lowly employees have been given a single raise of $0.13 cents. That means that the newest new-hire off the street will make as much at me. To a full-time employee who's been loyal to the company for two years, has excelled at everything he does there, this is just insulting. ...And now, corporate is regretting giving us that measly insignificant excuse for a raise. With each passing quarter, we employees get something else taken away from us by management or corporate. My department makes the company a profits, while the other department seems to simply bleed money, resulting in my department's management cutting everything back like hours and other little shows of employee appreciation here and there. Don't work here. You won't get a raise. You won't be appreciated. The most you'll get is a thank you if you stay hours after your shift ends to help the next shift. You'll have to listen to the annoyance of peers with little education bicker back and forth and fight all day, sometimes to the point of cussing each other out. You'll constantly have to wonder why most people around you have the ""that's not my job, I can't be bothered with that"" attitude, while you seem to be the only one trying to be a team player. In five years, Brink's will be even worse off, financially. Save yourself the hassle and seek employment elsewhere."
bad,"This company is strictly a buddy system. Very difficult to raise a family, and benefits are horrible."
bad,Due to security reasons that could cost me my job I can not explain my  typical day.
bad,"It's a job if you absolutely need one, but the environment and the culture of the company quickly drains the life and motivation out of the employee. Within 90 days, you'll likely be looking for a new job. The company itself is unstable, the benefits are useless, They will lie to get you in the door and then continue to lie to get you to stay."
bad,This place lacks effective communication from top and it trinkles down to floor.  There's no training for new employees.  Management has no clue on how to resolve issues therefore leaving you to get yelled and screamed about from the vendors.  When asking for help about this on several occasions all I got was the runaround. I can't work in a place that can't help or won't let me succeed. I've came home every night growing more and more frustrated.
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,"Its a jobs that is very dangours. And attention to detail, and stay focus ."
bad,In my opinion this was not a great company to work for. They make a lot of empty promises to employees and they don’t seem to care when they don’t deliver. The company does not have integrity towards the hard working individuals. The ones who complain and do less work get all the glory. They don’t discipline the negative lazy people in fear that they will quit and then a body is lost. The guys who put in all the effort and hours will get let go over the simplest thing.
bad,"If you dont have a life maybe a good fit for you but very tedious work your ot is capped and really no days off and no end time! Thus is the type of job were your managers do not have your back and pretty much every man for themselves type of situation, they show favoritism and tf hey do not work as a team, good luck!"
bad,There more then entire list of issues with that company and it all starts at the top for those who want to start working it’s good for someone who wants start being an armed security officer.
bad,"I worked on a contract-to-hire basis.  Believe me when I say, this company is every bit of toxic as you’ve ever seen.  Management and HR have hidden all the complaints that former employees have had.  If you utter your frustrations, you will be fired.  And if it’s unethical (and in some instances I’ve seen here, unlawful), HR will cover it up.  I’m glad to be away from this place.  Beware, you’ve been informed."
bad,"The job itself is fine, obviously sucks when it’s super hot or super cold but the actual job is easy. You control what time you end your day for the most part, just depends how hard you hustle. Time off is difficult to come by. You are real lucky if you get it. MANAGEMENT IS HORRIBLE! Worst of the worst. Very unorganized and zero communication between “leadership”. You will find yourself constantly frustrated and overworked. The money isn’t worth it."
bad,The overall job is easy but you have absolutely no work life balance! None and management could care less hence the reason while I worked there for four months at least 15 employees quit and it was enough for me because our days got longer and longer it was overall mentally exhausting! They don’t gives breaks after your first eight hours meaning you can be in there another 8 hours with no break! When I left people that had been there for years started quitting! Steer clear of this job if you have kids and want to see them during the week not just on the weekends because you won’t have a life during the week and you will be too tired to enjoy your weekend off as often you will work from 8am until sometimes 12am at night! Stay away because they don’t care about their employees at all!
bad,"If you enjoy a busy, dirty, loud warehouse environment with old equipment and illogical strategies...this might be a good fit.  If you believe you will only ever be worth 11.25 an hour for busting it out daily until you have nothing left  mentally when you leave the building...this might work for you....not recommend for any who thrives on verbal communication and is okay with not having any sunlight or mental stimulation unless on a break."
bad,Worked for this company for 10 years plus slowly started doing away with the reasons people come into work everyday and give it their all. No benefits no incentives an you had to work weekends even though you've been there longer than others and had seniority over them including Sundays. It's a big company but has VERY low interest in keeping good workers and replacing them with cheaper laborers.
bad,"There is no specific position at Brinks. You WILL work in every position for no pay raise or you'll get an hourly decrease. You work alone a lot and you'll have way more merchandise than you can carry safely. You never get a break or lunch, you'll have to do it on your own time, which you'll never have. The day starts at 0730 and doesn't end until around 1800 or later. There have been people there for over 20 years that only received a $1 pay raise. Stay away from Brinks. Aurora,CO Brinks pays $15 no pay raises."
bad,"I worked there starting as a messenger, but when I realized they valued money and their profits over the safety of their employees I switched to a driver position. Once I did that, they got irritated and started shortening my days and hours. Saying it was because the Atlanta branch wasn't making any profit so they cut days on the drivers but not the messengers. After a while they started doing one-man routes which cut the driver positions all together. Meaning the messengers drove and worked the route alone which was way more dangerous in itself when no one is watching their back while they work. The turnover rating was crazy, people quitting left and right and it was with good reason. Once I found another solid paying full time job, I did the same. It's not worth the headaches everyday, wondering if you're going to get enough hours on your check for two weeks or if you might get hurt on the job. Look elsewhere for employment..."
bad,"Management at this company was terrible, The work loads were always heavy, Although there was plenty of room for overtime there was very little time or family."
bad,"This is a company that does not care for its employees at all, it is all numbers numbers numbers."
bad,"No leadership at all in the company. No chance for advancement, or anyway to move up, and they almost always hired outside the company and not from within."
bad,"I got paid to relocate and was promoted to management. Upon arriving, the branch was like a preschool. The manager ignored the biggest issues to avoid losing people and the rumor mill around the building destroyed moral. I ended up getting terminated for something that management had done multiple times before and I become the fall guy. I was left with not enough staff to conduct the daily operations and had to make a judgement call to keep the branch functioning that day and was terminated for it. I don't recommend working here as they will promise you a lot but never come through and will instead use you as the scapegoat to save themselves."
bad,"Could be a great company to work for if not for the benefits cost  and management politics.  They have an  out dated truck fleet, which they are trying to fix, and the lack of technology advancements in the last 10 years. Middle management seems to have forgotten the working people who are on the front lines daily.It was as if  middle management played politics because of their personal agendas."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,Not the most exhilarating place to work. Very disorganized and management nor the company cares about workers. Long hours and underpaid for work done
bad,"This job taught me to finish my education, great place to work part-time or something to do when retired. Poor Management and zero room for advancement. Most enjoyable part of job was when shift was over."
bad,Very challenging environment.  Brinks IT leadership are all afraid of high priced consultants that use to work with the CIO.  There is no leadership and the high priced consultants are on a mission to get ride of all contractors that don't work for them.
bad,"NO LIFE...... POOR MANAGEMENT"
bad,This is the place to work if you like to work 6 days a week. Too much to do and not enough time.
bad,"great company, poor management, horrible atmosphere, no loyalty to employees fires employees who have been there over 20 years with no regard"
bad,This company doesn't care about their employees just the customers!!!! No room for advancement and they cut hours with nooooo problem leaving you and your family to struggle stay away!!!!!
bad,"Brink’s Chicago is thee worst branch I’ve ever worked for. The managers are horrible, ALL of them. I have 3 managers that are ALL on a different page. The main one is a liar, she mainly wants the job done, but don’t do anything but dictate. The other one is so submissive and says “yes” to everything. Super weak. And the last one actual works on the floor and makes sure her side is good, even though I know she’s over it. The new branch manager full of it too. Over worked and underpaid."
bad,I worked there for about 5 months and never got more hours like I was promised. I went in everyday at my scheduled time and given the bad end of the stick everytime I turned around. It was utterly ridiculous. I hated every single minute of my job there. You supervisors dont even try to help you.
bad,Horrible place to work. Poor management and poor pay rate . Poor / dirty work environment. Long hours . No growth and unfair treatment of workers. Very poor benefits.
bad,Disorganized not what i was expecting the mangment was not good at all neither was the pay for the amount of work they make you do and they do not pay over time
bad,"Terrible place to work. No working ac in trucks. Dollies are terrible. It’s a go, go, atmosphere. Poor training techniques, with no advancement in the company."
bad,No llamen a la fono linea de ayuda en caso de acoso laboral ya que los mismos supervisores tiene bloqueada esta fono linea para que no los denuncien. Tienden a amenzar a oos empleados que pueden denunciar yblos degradan al punto de hacerlos echar por supuesta incompetenncia.
bad,Upper Management have no communication among themselves!! Use verbal verses email communications for employees.  Very poor in running department changes!!! The training of change is very poor and inconsistent for the employee!! I don't recommend a job at Brinks Incorporated!!! It is very stressful place to work. The work culture is very poor!!!
bad,This place sucks for employees. In coin room you have no chance at advancing no matter how much you ask about it. Managers do not work physically with employees unless it is totally unavoidable. You cant run a place if you dont work as a team.
bad,"The management was very poor,organization was very poor,they consistently lie to u,and they play the game of favorites.you do not have a scheduled time to get off work,and the pay for what we do was absolutely wrong and disgraceful"
bad,"There is a lot to learn. Every day is a new experience. The work environment is slow pace.  There isn't much micro-management, I love this aspect of the job."
bad,"Sold Home security to prospective home buyers for their new homes, as well as existing homes.Our customers were nationwide and we contacted them via phone."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,"its like you back in high school the manager have favorite people "
bad,"They don't care about your family, or health or your feelings"
bad,"I am not please with this place. They play favorites with workers, also the management is bad. I have been working this job for 5 years, there is no room for growth that's why I am looking for a better job."
bad,"The pay is awesome, but the management is beyond horrible. It has a lot of changes in the job description. The management always contradicts themselves!!! The company doesn't likes to give raises. DO NOT WORK FOR BRINKS!!!"
bad,Long hours and bad management. Co-workers were great and they felt the same way I did about the job.  Very great job but corporate needs to do some work.
bad,"12+ hours daily"
bad,Wouldn't recommend this company to anyone 11.60 hr for a chance to loose your life very long hours hard labor do all things the hard way there they dont care about employees NOT worth it at all dont work there
bad,"Started off great, but slowly started falling apart. Company is constastaley going through changes. Upper management dont care about the employess"
bad,"The hours are ridiculous! When you interview management does not explain that a normal 8 hour shift job is 12 hours with the company. A person can work up to 17 hours or more EVERYDAY!! No one is allowed to leave until the work is complete. Regardless if you have commitments after working all day til night, no one is allowed to go until he or she speaks to a supervisor. "
bad,"While Brinks is a very stable company, there is little to no work life balance, it is usually 11 to 13 hour days, and a couple of weekends per month. You must also be reachable as a manager 7 days per week. "
bad,"No structure what so ever. Very unorganized and understaffed. The end time is supposed to be 12am but you leave at 4,5,or even 6am everyday. The training has nothing to do with the job and nobody wants to help."
bad,"No future.  Over worked and under pay."
bad,They make a lot of promises when you first start but they fall short. The corporate managers are out of touch with their managers in the branch. There are a lot of shady things going on here.
bad,"The people in the company I worked with were incredible, but management was impossible. They had insane standards, would not solve problems that were repeatedly reported, and would pass blame for even the most trivial issue off to someone else. Nobody would take responsibility for anything. There were ridiculously long work hours and unfair practices and expectations."
bad,Started off good..ended badly. I felt used everyday. The pay sucked. Management sucked. I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy. Perfect just for if you're waiting on another job to call.
bad,When I was interviewed manager said I would work 4p-11p. When I started I found out two people quit on him. He asked if I could help out with morning shift temporarily. I agreed. Temporary turned into 6 months. I addressed this to him and he kept lying saying more people were coming on board. The manager didn’t care about the job he took a two week vacay without training me. Shortly after he broke his foot and I had to have other people conduct the route with me. On top of all of that I would finish my route early he would suggest I stay out until 5:30 until other customers call for pick up so he could receive a yearly bonus.
bad,"I would not recommend working at Brinks unless you are a mindless automaton.  They relocated me from 1,000 miles away, paid moving expenses, and a week after I got my family relocated they eliminated my job."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,"long hours if you work hard they will take advantage of you and work you like a dog. "
bad,Job is great. The team have a lot of drama but other then that a great job. enjoyable about this job is getting your paid. the hardest part with the company is the pay and the daily drama. I have learned a lot here and more room to grow but the company hold you back because of pay increase.
bad,Great place to start a career and make name for yourself. I am so proud for working at Brinks.
bad,-Say they promote from within but don't
bad,"I worked at Brinks Home Office in Coppell, TX for over 3 years. It was the worst job experience I have ever had. The IT department went through NOC management every year. Every single manager was basically worn out due to upper VP management not approving project improvements due to IT budget. Their is no chance to grow or be promoted within. Their is alot of politics going on within the company. IT projects that were started 4 years ago are still not completed. Brinks business management basically runs the IT department and decides what products to use. IT upper management has no idea what they are doing and seems to be only enjoying the job till it last. All upper management always some how turns out to be outside of work best friends, and they only hire their own friends. The Network Operations Department is the worst IT department and IT person can work in. All other IT departments look down on the NOC team."
bad,"the work environment was messy and very hard to focus on work. the managers were not up to par as far as professional levels. Workers made complaints often, with little no to acknowledgment of solutions."
bad,Very stressful job the manager sucks don't care for the people that has been there for years but treat the new drug having and thieving people like trophies they are very quick to fire you over anything the hours are terrible if you got kids not the place mandatory overtime NO RAISES its very dirty not a team work place everyone one for themselves a lot of gossip and that what manager like is gossip and snitches the leads are dumb as a door nail don't work here please don't RUN
bad,"It was easy work, repetitive, really no room for advancement and I just wanted more myself and my children! I am sure that the position would be perfect for someone looking for that type of work. Great Company, good people! I was told that I was over qualified but was not advanced to another position."
bad,"they are trying but no one talks to you about anything and there is no way to get ahead in brinks. sad but true. maybe someday they will be a great place to work, but not now"
bad,Si no aprecia su vida trabaje en esa compañía es de alto riesgo no concuerda el salario con el riesgo que corre
bad,I worked for this company for 13 years and loved my job. Then I had my son and they changed and expected me to still pull 70hr weeks in which I was unable to do cause I had a new born child. The hardest part of the job was going in at 5am and leaving at 2am on multiple occasions.
bad,management is horrible and everyone is for themselves instead of helping each other become successful. The over all workplace is fun if you are working with the right people and don't have people coming at you for small mistakes. they have to understand that everyone is human and have lives.
bad,a nice work day. Mangers what nice and helpful. I like that we got profit sharing check every 3 months. we didn't get off work until the job was complete
bad,"The lack of organization in this company is so unbelievably awful for the type of work that is done. Management is never wrong, they don't care if you work till 9 o clock one day because they leave by 6 everyday so it's not their concern, and if you mess up, you fix it, but if someone else messes up, you fix it too. Not a good place to work."
bad,"If you don't have an issue with gettign calls back to back to where you really aren't even able to get a break to go to the bathroom, then this is the job for you."
bad,"I worked here for 11 years. I was an exemplary employee. It became clear that management was only worried about cutting back hours, rushing us through routes(which ultimately costed me my job because of a mistake that could've been prevented had my supervisor not been constantly calling me asking me where I was) and saving the company money. They couldn't care less about the employees. Only good thing about the company is the pay I got here and the benefits. My checks were decent if I was allowed to work a 6th day."
bad,"Very unethical place of business, poor management."
bad,"ATM Management"
bad,the pay wasn't bad but benefits were expensive. this is the worst place I have ever worked. co-workers were so disrespectful and management did nothing about it.
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,Brinks is a great company with good benefits but the pay was not good for me. Safe and a pleasant place to work. It is a Monday Thur Friday job no weekend
bad,It was an ok place to work but after 10 yrs of employment you didn't receive any more raises but they steady working you as if you are getting raises annually. Coin operators made money than the Logistics Processors not fair
bad,"A typical work day at Brinks is very busy, you learn something everyday if your willing to learn. Management needs improvement in the areas of communication and work knowledge. Workplace culture is diverse but can be judgmental based on your work performance. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the everyday challenges of trying to do your job without either the correct information or tools needed. The most enjoyable part about the job is its a job and you have to appreciate having a job."
bad,"Pay is inadequate, management lacks communication.  Not a career environment. Hours are extremely long, no solid pay increases, trucks are very outdated."
bad,"The Job itself is awesome, but the management is a joke, no one is held accountable and its a free for all for the employees. If you call HR they never do anything to fix the problems an it continues to get worse."
bad,Management doesn't have their employees back or trust. Everything is important and high priority for supervisor. Management team only looks after their salaried employees and toss their hourly employees to the wolves.
bad,This could be an amazing place to work if the management didn't chose sides. If they didnt like you they woukd make you processes the worst of the worst with no help. Management didn't care if you passed out and died as long as you got the work done. They don't train you but expect you to come in knowing everything. Horrible place to work if you have kids or a life for that matter.
bad,Promotion promises that are never received.  Management doesn't seem to care about problems nor do they provide any assistance to solve problems.  Most other co-workers are great to be around and have great attitudes despite the lack in management.
bad,"Very uncomfortable environment, bad management, lots of gossip."
bad,"long hours. management primary concern is deliver money/pick up money no matter if your out on the road until 9pm to10pm every night. same for vault staff come in at 2p, 3p and work until 4am sometimes 5am everyday. managers are not trust worthy. no time for lunch unless you can eat and drive at the same time then you get in trouble for doing just that. watching all movement in vehicle all the time"
bad,Not enough Pay for the dangerous risk of transporting money! 13.00Hr is not enough to support any lifestyle! Management does not know how to manage due to nepotism! Forcing officers to take one man driving positions shows lack of concern for the well being and safety of one's life!
bad,Your under payed to be risk ur life everyday and there no union you can work there for 3 years and still be fired for something simple honestly not a stable  job
bad,"Very quick paced job with daily deadlines that have to be met. Good working environment, great helping and caring coworkers. But this job requires the ability to work long work hours up to 13 hour days. If you have children this is not the place for you. But great learning experience to take with you to next position"
bad,The company uses a DOT loophole to not pay workers overtime and they regularly schedule you over 40. The turnover is insane and that includes management. The place is unfriendly to labor.
bad,Stressful work environment. I learned how to count a lot of money there was no hard part to the job. A typical day was to walk in into people talking about how they did not like the job and the work load that we had to do.
bad,"I would clock in athe 6:30am and I wouldn't get off work tell 10:00pm everyday."
bad,The job had excessive international travel over 90% and a very high turnover with rapidly changing environment and leadership. This resulted in a luck of knowledge transfer due to the high turnover.
bad,"60 plus hours a week with no overtime pay. Hard work, disorganized, trucks are junk, no room for advancement. Most of the higher ups have never worked at brinks. They do not promote from within and that's the number 1 problem with this place."
bad,"Quality of life is terrible"
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,Brinks used to be the premier amored car company  but the company has lost their focus and put profits before customers and employees  our branch manager has quit because of company practices we have a skeleton crew and are having customer services failures because there are not enough employees to run all the routes to much work and not enough time to get to all stops it is my belief  that this company will not be around long operating like they are
bad,In 2013 overtime TIma and Half cut to 10 hours per pay period. After 10 hours all overtime is straight time. Every Branch is Short staffed thus some people work 6days. And up to 120 hours a pay period. If you have a family or a life outside of work this isn't for you.
bad,"the job does not provide any security."
bad,"I learned a great deal of ethic and responsibility and dedication here. Most of my co-workers became good friends at work as well as there for your outside of the workplace. The only enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers trying to keep spirits high/light and the customers we serviced were very pleasant and understanding and very greatful when you went the extra mile. The work load was heavy to start, physically but doable of course; however as time progressed we steadily lost a great number of employees including the branch supervisor due to the continually fading work conditions. Being in a medal box with absolutely no flowing air or a/c takes a tool when loading so much weight daily; only because once broke the company did not see fit to spend the extra funds to replace any parts, just enough to get it running. Not very safe in such a high risk job. no work day is less then 8hrs, most are at least 10 and upwards of 12-16 a day 5-6days a week. The overtime was also taken as of January 1, 2014. 1year with the company and I have watched over 14 employees come and go, most over stress and heavy work weeks."
bad,no good very bad management the wors security company in Ireland iand i Know quiet a few
bad,Transport currency and valuables. service ATMs and replenish them. 
bad,Job itself is great. Working with the others is where the issue is. If u aren’t liked then they will talk about you like there is no tomorrow. Especially when you leave the room
bad,"Brinks Inc. isn't the place to work if you have children and family obligations, the most enjoyable part is the time spent with co workers. Not much room for growth"
bad,The schedule is all over the board. management does not care if you have family obligations. Official policy is if you call out you will only get one or two days on the next weeks schedule.
bad,"Too much work and not enough employees.  Brinks should have shifts, but instead workers start early in the morning and can't leave until all work is done.  Forced overtime."
bad,"horrible management, not a good work inviroment, they don't take their time with you they just throw you right in and expect you to know everything. the managers don't do anything but sit in their office. the pay isn't worth the hassle"
bad,"Brinks could be a great place to work. Not a difficult job at all. Overall easy, however, management needs a total re-haul at its location. Constant up and down revolving of employees. Quick to burn out workers. No balance of job/quality of life for the numbers of hours spent at the site. Needs to improve or will constantly lose workers."
bad,"A mono tone work environment, that under pays. There is no advancement position and the company has a, We don't care attitude. No matter how well you do your job, they dont care. And because of that employees stop caring and it makes it hard to want to be there."
bad,The work overload is too much for the low pay they provide. This is the main reason why they’re always hiring. People are always leaving for better opportunities. You can’t really survive of a paycheck that pays 11 an hour. Messengers only get pay a $1 and a few change more and you’re putting your life at high risk. There’s always open positions but everything is based on preferences even if you have the experience supervisors won’t consider you for the role. What makes the place even harder to work is how dirty and unsanitary it is inside. They rarely keep the place clean. There’s just dirt and dust everywhere. People are always calling in sick for this main reason. I give it a two stars because my shift lead supervisor is super nice either than that it’ll be a one.
bad,"I Worked For Brinks for 18 Months And I Regret Every day I Spent Getting up going to that dump !! The Management From Branch Manger Too The Coin Room Supervisor Was Very Inexperienced, Lack Of Training, lack of Communication, No Respect For The People of Color, Very Racist and Sexist. The Hours Are Horrible 7am until 11pm even 1am at times. Alot Of Sexually Misconduct between Staff members and Management."
bad,"This branch has been under new management 3 times while I was employed there for 1.5 years. The current management team does not care for their employees nor the training they are given. They will send you on a route, somewhere you may not know, with little training and expect you to complete your route within a certain time with little to no mistakes. They slack in proper training and cannot retain employees because of all the work and terrible management team."
bad,"When employee expressions of security concerns are labeled as loathing, and used by management as an excuse to identify and eliminate the dissenters. When management denies that employee safety is never compromised because of financial gains, then it's time to move on ..."
bad,It was a great start but I wuickly realized that management did not care about me but themselves. I worked many hours including month end closing and was permanently drained and sick. It was miserable.
bad,"Hours are never consistent, pressured into overtime even after you have said you have prior commitments. No vacation allowed around Christmas unless you are salaried."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,"Brinks Global Services has a great supervisory staff, but upper management and security management are disconnected from the workforce."
bad,"Start out as driver, if management likes you or you request to become a messenger, you’ll become a messenger within a few months. Put in for vacation multiple times, only to be told dates were unavailable. This was due to the high turnover. Not enough employees, created more stress for drivers and messengers, ie; sending them back out to complete other routes and/or adding to already heavy workload. Safety is preached high but radios, trucks and firearms were never upgraded or improved. As a new member you will be put with another new member and your days will become very long, 10+hr days at times. You will get paid overtime at least but any social life outside of work will be gone. “Learn as you go” is expected. Hopefully your experience is better than mine, good luck!"
bad,"management is poor. Also not professional, more like high school. You have to stay over even when its time for you to get offf. You work one big machine a month an sometimes you dont leave until 1 a.m"
bad,overall the work day at brinks is too long . no one relly has a set time to get off. the job is very stressful . no time for personal life. i think this has a lot to do with management.n/a
bad,You risk your life for nothing. And the managers are disrespect. They don't care anything about you. They make you deliver money in Brinks trucks by yourself. I didn't even have a gun or training and they sent me out on a truck.
bad,"The mangers in the cash room need to all take a mandatory course on how to be an effective supervisor. No teamwork. The only time you can advance is if somebody quit , and they still will already have somebody lined up for that position that they want to have . No annual raises ."
bad,"Typical day is 8 hours on the road, maybe 3 hours in the branch depending on schedule and branch size"
bad,Benefits and Overtime is a big problem there. They are not concerned about your safety becazuse of the new trucks they are getting in. You only get paid 5 hours overtime then back to regular time after that. Thats not fair
bad,"Management was a joke, no advancement unless you want to be working at the same job for years, raises are only 12 cents a year and the health insurance benefits are a joke. Very expensive with no real benefits. Only allotted 3 sick days for a year. Also, there was no camaraderie at all. Everyone was at each others throats everyday. Horrible!! Do NOT APPLY"
bad,"The hours are awful, there's never a set end time. The pay is way undercut for the work you deal with. The raises are horrible. The trucks break down all the time."
bad,"I worked for Brinks for almost a year and came in with high hopes of staying with the company, for as long as they would have me. However after only a few months of working there it had become painfully clear, that no one in the department cared about team work. Everyone was always trying to keep from doing more than what was expected of them, and most times the new employees were appointed to do all of the hump work, needed to complete a days shift. They gave this one individual (task-master), reign over the department (unofficially of course), while the managers (2) females hid in their office, lolly gagging and making personal phone calls. We would be out of balance almost every night and would sometimes have to stay 3-6 hours after our shift to find the error, before we were allowed to go home. This job became a reoccurring nightmare and everyday I would dread going to work. Although I will always appreciate the opportunity given to work at Brinks, I feel that this company has miles to go for improvement. It has been over two years since leaving my position at Brinks and for the sake of my physical well-being and mental sanity...it was the best move I have ever made."
bad,"I started working here with much excitement and anticipation. That quickly changed. They had gone into a pay freeze without telling me before I was hired. For the better part of a year, even though I was 1 of only a few (3 in total) commercial (class ""A"" lic) drivers, I received no pay raise for almost 1 year. Then in January, they gave an across the board raise, BUT, they no longer pay any ""DOT"" employee overtime. Not only that, they will work you to death if you let them. I am currently trying to find another job, but it is tough when you work 10+ hours a day and only have 1 day off during the week. If only I had it to do over again."
bad,Loved meeting with customers. Unorganized on the management side of the business.
bad,The people you work with is like family. Great people to work with. Would be better if the employees could run the company without managers. Does not really care about its employees. Managers worry more about how they look instead of taking care of their employees.
bad,"High turnover, poorly managed and the everyday conduct is disappointing. There is really no purpose in working here. You will be drained and exhausted with no real incentive to stay. You are packed into one space with too many people and there are very low standards of building cleanliness. Bugs are everywhere."
bad,The managers are in clicks and if you are not in well you are out. Talent Acquisition is a joke and they are behind the curve. The department is very toxic. The director and recruiting coordinator is best friends and she can do no wrong.
bad,"A typical day starts before the sun is up, changes as the day goes- sometimes even backtracking- and ends when it ends. I've learned how to better manage my time, and verbally explain processes to others better. Multitasking is a must. Management on either side of the wall have plenty to work on, especially as far as keeping morale up, not lying to us, and listening to suggestions rather than nod and laugh. Seems like keeping us in the dark must be in their secret handbook- right next to how to promote someone without posting a job first so everyone has a chance. Most of us on the street get along with one another pretty well. We are all trying to make it home safe and try to help each other out as we can. The hardest part of the day is not letting the things that go wrong pile up on you as it happens. The best part is lunch or getting to know some of the customers we see frequently who try to make our days a little better."
bad,"Be prepared for changes that will stress you out and make it challenging to bonus as they promise. High turnover, building is known for making layoffs in all departments, there's a new training class every week and a lot of the quality leaders have either been let go or they were wise enough to seek opportunities elsewhere."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,"job absolutely not worth it, long hours, no overtime pay, management was disorganized, very high turn over rate while  i was there, simply not worth it, only pro to working for them is they have an in house instructor for your security licenses"
bad,"I do not intend to stay in my current role at this company long-term , I would like to move into some other role at this company. This job is very stressful,  they treat you like a slave very long hours on some days 10 hours plus no breaks and only 30 minute lunch sometimes we don't even get a lunch some co working are nasty and mean , management can be very nasty even if you are working hard and  doing your job like you should, pay is very low for all the hard work that you do can't even make $1,000 after taxes bi weekly , there is also a lot of favoritism going on by management they do not treat everyone as equals."
bad,The work consists of logistics of shipments from different parts of the world and brinks undertakes the responsibility of ensuring security of consignment services to respective customers.
bad,"Not Productive, not a fun place to work, very stressful, long hour's typical day processing deposit's, balancing cash vault. Standing all day, vey bad"
bad,"I liked this job at first, because of how cool I thought it was going to be. Everyday, there were constant problems, from trucks breaking down to an emotionally unstable manager. Managers should be someone you can look up to and talk to about issues, without being cursed at or disrespected. The hardest part of this job was not the actual work, but dealing with the manager. You are expendable at Brinks unless you are a manager. Managers are never disciplined for their actions towards employees."
bad,"Fast moving paste , non stop stops anywere between 30-60 stops a day, work with aver 100 co worquers , no room to grow or move up the latter , poor management skills, very very low pay"
bad,"Brinks is in the midst of major changes, for the worse.  They have decided that this once great security company is now a manufacturing company.  They are making changes to force management into the mindset of manufacturing, and away from security.  This is a major detriment to the employees.  In the past, the number 1 goal of the company was to bring their people home safe every night.  This is no longer the goal.  The mindset at hand is now profit at all cost."
bad,"avec le temps beaucoup de mauvais recrutement et corruption de la part du chef d'agence envers certain salariés genre des cdi de 3 ans d'ancienneté mieux payé que ceux de 10 ans. non respect des 48 h par semaine et le coté humain a disparu, en gros marche ou créve"
bad,"Not organized.  Mgmt changed three times while I was employed there.  When I was promoted to management I was never trained for my new position that I held for 6 months before I left.  Pay was not good for the risk that this job entails.  They wanted to have people follow the rules, but with the management changing and no training no one wanted to follow rules and do things ""the Brinks way"" as they would say.  Most of the regular people there were great to work with and I will miss them, but not the environment I had to work in day to day."
bad,"I worked briefly for the northern Ohio branch. Overall, the company treats it's employees as numbers and if you're looking for a job to punch the clock then Brinks is alright. However, management isn't looking out for employees safety, training is subpar and the pay isn't  much either. Additionally, almost all of the management members do not have a background in either law enforcement, military or security.  Mostly, they come from retail and are more concerned by the bottom dollar and have not clue on security training or tactical experience. The trucks are in miserable condition as management saw fit to get rid of the second  mechanic. Most of the trucks  are mechanically unsound and either overheat or have engine issues that go unfixed."
bad,"my coworkers were good people but the company culture is to use you up and discard you. No real advancement was available. "
bad,If had a different opportunity will go elsewhere. I'm the short period that I've work here it's shown a lot and everyone that works here is lazy and always has an attitude.
bad,Worked for Brinks for a while. Absolutely hated it. You go from early in the morning to complete which could put you doing a 14-16hr shift. That wouldn't be bad if you didn't have to explain every minute of that time. Everything is down to the second. The health insurance isn't bad if you want to pay half your paycheck on it along with co pays. One thing I hated was when you were still out doing your job late at night. Management was at home with their family not giving caring about you. 6am-3 they were there for you. After that...good luck champ. You got this.
bad,Upper management has no clue on how to run a Global Business. Long hours and they are very keen on low balling employees when it comes to pay. They typically hire and promote friends and family over qualified individuals.
bad,"Calling out is shunned. If you are sick you are ridiculed by coworkers and some management. Vacation is treated in much the same way."
bad,Working at brinks as a vault teller was a job made for people who have thick skin and can roll with the punches. Some of the leadership would spew vulgar language all the time and even gossip about their employees with their junior peers.
bad,"NO COMMENT..... SMH"
bad,"Too many hours, routes too long, worked there about 7 months."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,Not a great work environment. Management wont take workers opinions seriously. Co-workers always have something bad to say about everyone
bad,"Travail à la chaine."
bad,Well established company in the industry. Current excutive management is trying to change the values and culture of the company.
bad,Poorly managed company. Poor work/life balance. Plantation mentality. You work for them not with them is what I learned. My co-workers were nice but totally cowed.
bad,I do not rcommend working at this place unless they have a new branch manager. The branch manager lies about everything just to get you to do what he wants. They all talk behind everybody's back! I hated working there.
bad,"A thriving, growing, and rewarding company at one time. Unfortunately a changing industry, with inexperienced management leading the way to the decline."
bad,"Decent work hours for retention reps, weekends off..try not to upset management or else they’ll hone in on you and make sure you know who’s in charge.BHS, Please don’t lie to your customers...and make sure to treat people how you would want to be treated. Many managers didn’t want to take escalated calls and would patronize employees. Not all were bad, but the culture wasn’t the  best...they gave us donuts and had us sit in a room for 15 minutes to try and make it better...lol."
bad,"We all think brinks is a great place to work at first, great for your resumé, etc. but you don’t have a life balance, they expect you to stay until everyone is finished which can take up to hours past your schedule time..no time for any business to handle and for the amount of money we count/touch the pay is definitely low $11.55..we had unlimited OT but in taxes that extra money didn’t matter"
bad,"Low Pay with very high standards which are not consistent with pay given.  Raise the bar and attract right talent, organizational change requires talent to push the change"
bad,"No Support from HR and Corporate on the recruitment, and due to less man power Operations teams taking to much of pain in achieve customer requirements"
bad,"That's basically the gist of it. A typical day starts about 8:30 a.m. and will end around 7:30 p.m. The hours wouldn't be so bad if the pay was higher and there wasn't so much confusion at the end of the day. Also, they company is very bad about keeping its promises. I was promised a yearly raise. Ive been there well over a year and still haven't gotten a raise. They keep saying that its coming but I have yet to receive it. All in all, dont bother with this company."
bad,My experience with  Brinks was an up and down emotional rollercoaster. I was cross trained within the Fort Wayne branch and excelled at many different positions. I was never offered advancement of any kind and really didnt feel appreciated for everything I did know. I lost out on many family outings due to having to work because the staffing was awful. Its definitely not a job I would suggest to a single parent because you never have set hours and it's nearly impossible to not miss important milestones in your children's life. I was with the company for five years and watched the best employees leave one after another because of poor management. I do not feel that the company cares about the safety and security of their employees which is shown through new company practices.
bad,Mon-sat 6am until finish route
bad,"I will not provide an answer, this is not for anyone or you to place in your comments, everyone has their own opinions of this company therefore I refuse to provide any details as to my experience with this company. They pay very well"
bad,"While the pay is good at Brinks, the management is not  very good. They don't communicate and seem to fire people randomly. I would not recommend Brinks if you are looking for something stable."
bad,"Steeping stone job, to move into a better paying job. To worried about meeting quotas, then listening to employees ideas that would meet their quotas. "
bad,This is good to start someone off but if you are looking to move up it will be difficult to do. The management changes way too much from the head to the bottom. The company should not have a %47 turn over from new hires to the old hires.
bad,"Company still going management change since 2012."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,I really enjoyed my experience at Brinks Brooklyn but I did not receive the supportive i needed from Executive Managers. I worked over 60 plus hours per week
bad,"There is constant employee turnover and even for armed carriers, the pay is way below what it should be.  The hours get to be ridiculous when the branch is not fully staffed, which is almost all the time"
bad,Stay away - Very disorganized - Very little training - No accountability - No one accepts responsibility for anything - Constant customer complaints and little resolution.
bad,"I'm used to working with money and around large sums of money and processing deposits, so the work is not foreign or different or hard for me. its the long hours. there is no cut off time you work till the work is done and as a current employee my branch has finally decided to hire more processors after the constant complaint for almost a whole year that we need help. there have been days I have worked with no break over 13 hours standing and that is because the longer I break the longer I will be there. the management is no help rude and overbearing. the cash lead has no idea how to talk to employees and work life sucks. I have no home life because we are there morning till night."
bad,"Management is unorganized and lacks structure"
bad,Management could care less about your family issues. Coworkers are cool with typical gossip talk. Problems with vehicles are not addressed when reported. Most enjoyable part of job is when i'm off.
bad,horrible place to work the managemnet was no good what so ever. He said he would work with schedules as I was a full time student and in the end fired me because while working 55 hours at his job and going to school both 5 days a week he decided that I was not flexible enough. In all honesty there was no consideration for any worker there.
bad,"This job will provide a paycheck and not much else, the management of this company is some of the worst I have ever seen. unfortunate because when I started several years ago, it was great."
bad,Responsible for safe transport of currency to and from banks and businesses. Some routes you will work 12 to 15 hours a day. Management were not trained properly which resulted in some employees not being trained properly. This is a much more physical job then people expect. Must be able to move 25 to 50 pounds of coin and currency all day long. Pay was pretty good.
bad,"After years of  a non engaged management. Operations and communication have completely disintegrated. It has finally started affected the bottom line. Bain Capital gave an analysis in 2013 stating basically if they did not fix several core areas(billing, communication, operations and growth in sales) within a year, Brink's would completely disintegrate as an entity. As of 2015, none of these areas have been fixed.As of Q1 2015, the stock has fallen 35% in a year. The 2014 results have not been posted, but more layoffs just occurred in Jan 2015. So, the final 2014 numbers are sure to be bad.  The shame here is that there is some really good people here but they are tending to axe them first."
bad,"The management was terrible. You are just a number to them. I was working 70+ hours a week monday through saturday 7 am until 10:30 pm. If you get sick, you have lost your job. If you have a family emergency and are out, you have lost your job. Actually had a crew member have a wreck and was paralyzed from the waist down in a Brinks truck. The branch manager only cared about the money lost in the wreck and didn't even send flowers to the family of the paralyzed crew member. Completely terrible place to work and try to make a career out of."
bad,"The equipment is older and prone to breakdowns, if you enjoy working in a metal can with no ac when it's over 90 degrees then this job is perfect. Management isn't concerned about problems until they become major problems by that time it's usually beyond something that can be fixed easily. They don't pay overtime after 45 hours and don't even think about asking for time off. This job tends to attract younger ""boys"" that are nothing more than wanna be cops and guns are their biggest priority in life. In my opinion Brinks has handled their finances nation wide very poorly and now the employees are paying the price!"
bad,management had a difficult time make choices and were often disconnected from the agents on the floor. The hardest part of the job was getting a straight answer on procedures from management
bad,"Supervised 3 personnel "
bad,"A typical day at work was demonistrating assigned food product. Keeping our area clean as well as our station. Greeting customers with a smile and explaining our product and serving samples and directing customers to where our product was located."
bad,"Delivery, pick up and reconciliation of valuables at a customer’s location, responsible for integrity and reconciliation of valuables throughout the daily scheduled run, and customer service."
bad,"Management has changed more times than one can count in the past 12-16 months. There seems to be a lack of transparency and trust. I believe people want to do the right thing but very few people seem to have the courage to speak their mind and stand up for what they believe in, especially if it will help the company. Compensation plans are unrealistic and change regularly which doesn't allow you to make maximum potential. A lot of ""working on it"" answers but very few results. Use to be a great work environment but declined rapidly. If you're located where HQ is, then the work experience will probably be much better as they get favored in lead volume, activities and other promotions."
bad,When I first started there it was cool but as the year went by they which 2 different mangers everything was out of order and disoriented and not very professional coming down to last days being there. I put in my 2 weeks notice the day after I lay me off and saying that I don't need to come back and finish my weeks left.
bad,"Organizational leaders will only work with you if you are part of their clique.  No sense of teams, large amount of infighting between managers making it impossible b to get anything finished. Lack of communication from execs keeps you guessing on the next firedrill."
bad,"Really loved working here until culture went bad real quick. I felt like I was a target early on and until the day I was let go. The work was easy but support from higher-ups was poor, especially when it came to feeling like my job was in danger. There was hardly any training and no organization. Just a disappointing experience all together."
bad,"The job is well.... a job. You have work duties and responsibilities like anywhere else. IF your not doing somebody else's job your more than likely never going to move up. Be prepared for long hours, promises to be broken, unfair work situations, and raises ranging from 40cents to 10cents... yes my raise was 10cents after 2 years of work and an outstanding review with notes from my branch supervisor crediting my work ethic. There is no real method of self improvement here just work and do it right or take a write up.  The pay is not sustainable for living and its impossible to move from the job due to the work hours so its kinda like a black hole. There are ups at the job but none that really balance anything of value. If you take the job we welcome you, but im not going to lie to you :)"
bad,"Brinks is a dead end job. Find any employee who is a messenger and ask them if they plan to work for brinks within the next 5 years, 95% of them will tell you no. You have 0 Opportunity for advancement, and you will be doing the same thing day in and day out for your entire career at brinks. Management will post job postings, interview you for a position that you will never fill. They will bring in outsiders or transfers from other branch, even if you have years of experience. They want to keep their guys that are on the trucks, on the trucks until they quit, or are fired. whichever happens first."
bad,"For a world wide security firm, the head management seems a bit too worried about the bottom line and not at all concerned with competent logical security operations A typical day can run anywhere from 6-10 hours and it is fairly easy. Middle management is great, they actually listen and most cases concur with any negatives brought to their attention, but they aren't in charge either, it falls flat most times. The workplace culture is chaotic because the bottom rung worker is left to believe the higher management cares more about stock options and cutting costs than doing an efficient job. All aspects of the technical part of the operations are over thought and excessively over complicated. The hardest part of the job was warehouse work while the easiest was actually the driving and delivery aspect. I enjoyed the people but not the company."
bad,"Unless you can stand the heat, stress, and rude people and long hours without A/c in the trucks. I would stay away from this company. The cash room is just as bad."
bad,"company allows for one man routes"
bad,"I learned to process deposits and find discrepancies. Diverse culture of people that work here, The hardest part of the job was not having a set time to get off."
bad,"I worked there for 3 years never got a pay raise, the manager was always out of the office or on his phone and no advancements,"
bad,It was a good place to work but now I hear it is not.  I enjoyed working there except for the last few years.  We were family and they cared about their employees and then they got a new president and things went downhill form there.  It became all about the profit margins.  Became top heavy while cutting branch personnel.
bad,Brink would not have been such a chore to work at if we had better management running the branch. It became a constant workplace of distrust and overworking without the proper compensation. There were clear violations of equal opportunity and favoritism that went unchecked. I will never work at this company again.
bad,"At Brinks I learned patience, quick decision making, and change. Management is mediocre. Being able to meet new people and traveling is the most enjoyable part for me."
bad,Brinks worked for me at the time I was in need of a job. The work is strenuous but challenging and fun to me. But the management is very unorganized and the pay is not worth the risk we take every day. Were out there risking our lives for  other peoples money for little to nothing with no overtime pay. I will work for brinks again if I was desperate but I'm looking for a career and this is not the job for a career.
bad,be ready to lose your job any day for any infractions they constantly monitor you on video feed and the turnover is frequent. the job security doesn't really exist unless youre a suck up or constantly on guard
bad,Brinks was one of the worst companys that I have ever worked for. The overall management team was terrible and I did not agree with the direction the company was going in.
bad,most people there have been in the same position since they have been hired. there really is no room for advancement unless you are personal friends with management
bad,Brinks was a fast paced company that was results driven. Wages and advancement opportunities were not their best asset. Employees were dedicated and enjoyable to work with.
bad,This was probably the worst place I have ever worked at tin my life. It was not organized at all and the hourly rate is not worth the chance of someone robbing a messenger. putting one's life on the line for a poor organized company and a low wage is not worth it. We worked 6 days a week and were not paid overtime. I'm sure overtime had to do something with us following DOT regulations.
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,"- It can be very long days "
bad,its ok i just moved so no its really far i did vault processing and dealt with different currency's. the manager was kind of mean to some of the employees and some of the employees arent professinal they think that the women there are also looking for dates which is pretty annoying
bad,i have learned some very valuable skills to carry with me throughout my careeer but it is not a place for advancement..Not a place for you to build a career
bad,"Only the senior guys have a set route, and even then your hours are never the same. one day you could be out for 10 hrs. the next your out for 12. one day I was out for 14 hrs. its much more work than it looks and will take a toll on your body."
bad,Very consistent work. No time off except vacation. No end time. High turnover ratio. Management inconsistent. I learned a lot on my own. Poor management cause a lot of problems. Everybody did not meet expectations on production level. Made the job harder for everyone else. No Teamwork.
bad,"Long shifts, unsocial hours, good boss. this job was full on, very busy, not even time to make a brew in a 10 hour shift. Not sure if the company is still operating now."
bad,"A typical day would be out on the road delivering valuables to various locations. My time with Brinks has taught me various skills in security and logistics. I have enjoyed working with all of the employees at Brinks and have no complaints about anyone. The hardest part of this job has been watching the armored industry slowly disappear due to the lack of cash-flow and the advancement of banking technology. Since then, benefits and salaries have been slowly cut in order to remain competitive within the industry."
bad,"Come into work, process deposits, enter data pertaining to each deposit per bank, verify funds entered with final end of day balance and close vaults."
bad,"driving for this company introduced me to the word of civilian security, and I am glad it set me up for the jobs I had in the area of security since."
bad,Management appeared to very unorganized. Daily routes were very seldom organized. Work schedules were not posted in a timely manner.
bad,this was not a fun job. it could have been better if i worked first shift and was working with some one else
bad,some friendly people. Playful job. somewhat good pay. no job security.
bad,"I worked for this company for 6 months. Started off okay, but the training and work direction of new employees is poor. Management sits in office all day and talk on phone, until something comes up missing.  Most of the co-workers are okay but there are a few select that think they run the place, due to the fact that management, supervisors, have ""head in the sand"" majority of the time and give these people unfair privilages then the rest of the crew."
bad,My main responsible was to main the cleanliness of the facilities to ensure a safe environment.
bad,During my employment with this company training was an issue. Also the steady flow of a permanent manager was lacking and cause for concern.
bad,the company is not a bad comnpany but for younger people who are energetic and looking for a career this is not the company for advancing
bad,Transporting valuable goods.
bad,Company is living off old reputation. Prcing and service is poor at best. They are losing a lot of customers to the competition
bad,you are treated the same as the person next to you; no chance of advancement (management) and no performance based raises... everyone looked at as the same based on job title
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,Working for this company I learned how to manage my time and I also learned valuable organizational skills. The hardest part of the job was the physical strain on my body and the most enjoyable part of the job was my awesome customers!
bad,you drive for a 14 hours shift inside an armored vehicle in the hot weather with no air condition
bad,"A typical work day includes of long hours, a lot of walking & giving good customer service. The job is risky mainly because I am dealing with money, management is fair. I am seeking better pay."
bad,You have to be committed to do this job. One should really ask themselves if they would like to work here. Long hours and dedicated requirements on the job
bad,"The job was not great but the people were. As a recruiting coordinator you handle about 40 different touch points to process and on-board a candidate and it was very high-volume, high turn-over with constant process changes and lacking in communication and structure across teams. Maybe my fault but I feel like I got thrown into a role and then moved and switched around with a lot on my plate and little support. I literally could not manage it all so I guess it wasn't for more. I met some good people here and the culture was good."
bad,"No communication, no customer service once account is gained. Supervisors don't take good advice. Too much arrogance and not enough communication and doing the job right. One man truck is dangerous and unsafe and anyone who is in a leadership position and approved the go ahead should be fired for making a life altering ignorant decision endangering workers."
bad,Poor management . I like the schedule but man poor management they have their favorites so no matter what you say they go base on them . They expect alot to be from one person. The supervisor doesn't train you she leaves up to tan rmplie
bad,"little pay"
bad,"Poor follow through, excessive hours, unorganized.  It doesn't matter if you're sick or not come to work.  There is no regard to your personal and home life."
bad,"The job requires long hours. The pay is fair, but only because of the overtime required. The employees are great for the most part. The management needs improvement."
bad,"If you're looking for a career this is not the job. Minimal to no job advancement opportunities and of the ones that exist only a small pay raise. No set hours, only a set show time but unpredictable when you'll go home as it's based upon when you finish your deliveries/pick-up. No overtime (5/hr cap per week). Dangerous job and not worth it for the pay offered. If looking for a part-time job for a little extra money maybe it's the job for you."
bad,High Turnover cant keep employees. the city manager is a great guy and fun and easy to work with.I dont like the direction the company is going by putting one person in a truck.
bad,"A typical day in the money processing area consists of management"
bad,"well the job is very stressful I felt I was working my life away the management at the time keeps a lot of dead weight around they keep about 2 messengers that could do the job well they had put all the work load on them and wouldnt fire people would consistently show up to work late or not at all, would leave the second they got back, or would drag a run out to where they would miss stops for someone else to pick up the slack"
bad,Brinks maybe a very nice company to start off with but quickly I learned that if you are not one of the chosen ones then you're less likely to move up or keep your job no matter if metrics are met
bad,"you either sat in a truck eight hours a day, or you were in the vault eight hours a day, with little to no breaks, due to the trucks rolling in and out of the building"
bad,"Worked 17 hour days backed up against a 14. Felt there were un safe practices occurring too often. My route was the ski resort area. Beautiful in summer but treacherous in winter. Fun part was every day was different with different clients. Important that driver covered the Messenger while he performed his duties outside the Armored Truck, for his safety. Overview and observation was paramount. Hardest part of the job was long hours and short hours alloted for sleep. Most enjoyable part was the mountainous scenery of our route."
bad,"A lot of driving on a daily basis. Huge rush by management to hurry up and get routes completed and be back at branch as quickly as possible to lower the branches output pay for it's drivers, guards and messengers. Highly dangerous position with not up to date firearms that would aid you in defense should a robbery or takeover of your armored car happen. Lack of ammunition for sustain such a robbery."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,"typical day at Brinks is data entry at the beginning of every shift. We then buy the loads of the trucks, which are customer deposits to bank branches, such as Bank of America, Wells Fargo...etc. Later in the day, we separate the change orders that customers request and the trucks deliver them on their specified route. Basically Brinks is just a post office with guns.  "
bad,"I didn't work there for a particularly long time so my review may not be entirely accurate but here is my view from what I had seen. The work hours are insane, I found my self working 60 hour weeks in very dangerous neighborhoods for pay that isn't particularly competitive. There was almost an unofficial 'no-break' policy. While in theory you could take them it was somewhat discouraged cause it meant falling behind time wise. Most people ate lunch between stops but unless youre working in the suburbs where there was a lot of time between stops that often meant falling behind on your paper work. The benefits were nothing special and if they catch you saying the word Union they'll find some pretext to fire you. Due to all of this the retention rate for messengers is VERY low. Many employees complained that their pay raises dont keep up with their skill. The longer you work there the faster you become at your job so you actually end up making less money."
bad,a typical work day at brinks is long and exhausting. you work hard but don't get paid worth jack for all that you do. been there three years and already on third manager.
bad,Not a place to be if you have a family and want a personal life outside of work.Pay is horrible for what we do everyday.No room for growth.
bad,Work was fast paced and required that you be able to lift 50lbs.  I liked the job and the ability to learn the aspects of banking.  The job was dirty because we handled and processed money and deposits all day long.
bad,"Over the last three years, we have lost benefits, hours, and starting wages have gone down.  10 years ago we lost pensions.  On the bright side there is job security once you get hired on."
bad,if you are ready to learn new things this is a good place to work
bad,i havent learned much because i wasnt properly trained. too much gossip. and the manager lied to get me hired
bad,The management staff sets unrealistic goals and pushes the staff to meet them.
bad,"My typical day begins with a pre-trip of the truck I am driving for the day. I load boxes of coin and other items I will need for the day. I make deliveries on a scheduled route while operating a safe vehicle. While driving, I use the 5 Smith System keys to insure I am being safe. My co-workers are great, some of the nicest, kindhearted, and genuine people I have ever met. The hardest part of my job is not knowing if you will still have a job the fallowing week. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people everyday."
bad,"I had been employed with Brinks less than a month. You have no time for yourself nor family. I come in at work at 3pm & work til the work was finished which would be around 2/3AM. I see that’s why they have a high turn over rate in the Vault. The supervisors was lazy, messy, talk on their phone all day, unorganized etc. Let this be your last option, don’t settle."
bad,Bust my butt for Brinks did work in every department new management was terrible tore down our entire team didn't properly pay us was incapable of employee appreciation ultimately high turnover rate long nights early mornings
bad,"At Brinks the hours we long, the work was hard, the pay was not comparable. Hard work never hurt anyone, I do not mind working hard. Brinks should have been a career but it was a job, there was no room for upward movement."
bad,brinks is a good place to work but it could become a great place if the pay was a little more cost of living rise would be nice cross the board  with that its ok there
bad,"Although change is good, continued changes in leadership and direction with no understanding of impact most to all stakeholders on how the negative impact, most importantly to the clients."
bad,"Unable to move up "
bad,Just don't work here if you got a family they treat they employees like trash bad training  bad trucks hottrucks no a/c slave work trash building .....
bad,Always busy day at work and I have learned a lot of things for the improvement of my knowledge and ability in the logistics industry. My co workers  are all good although they always dependent on me and lack of knowledge in coordination. The hardest part of the job is when nobody is there to cooperate  and no one can take the responsibility. And the most enjoyable part of the job is to finish the job or task on time.
bad,"Give Basic Training as to job description, worked with seasoned worker for a week or 2 and left up to your own devices as to any specific problems and constant contact as to why is it taking you so long I could of had it done hours ago etc"
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,"This company tends to drive it's employees hard - in going ""lean"" they overwork their current employees long hours. I would not recommend this company to anyone looking to learn."
bad,"A typical day at work usually included working shorthanded, as co-workers and subordinates were used as drivers or jumpers. Managers were not to blame because of the high turnover and call outs. I learned that every operational function had to be performed perfectly or the end of day balancing would not be in acceptable range. The hardest part of the job was working too many job functions per person, as meeting deadlines became difficult and quality of work decreased. The most enjoyable part of the job was balancing inventory successfully and working with good people."
bad,"This company is about money & how much it can make. Promotions are not really promotions, depending on your pay, you can increase by a little bit or decrease by a lot. You can't really get a straight answer to your questions, you have to keep asking, and that's not guaranteed answer. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my coworkers, we work hard together, and have fun at the same time."
bad,"Great benefits for the most part, but pay is very low considering what the job requires.  Constant battle to keep people.  No chance of advancement."
bad,"Days are long, because in most positions you take work home. Management is unorganized. There is no structured training so you feel as though they just throw you to the sharks. My co-workers were rude, and clicky. You have to plan on not having a life with this job."
bad,"Working at Brinks is OK. They do have a high turnover. The pay is OK, but I feel could be a little bit better since you are riding around with millions of dollars and your life is at risk everyday. The culture between coworkers is cool. Short little conversations while you load your truck, talk about sports mostly. The management team is ok. Some drivers can’t drive, and I wonder how some even still have the position other than being there over 15 years."
bad,"Typical Office Environment"
bad,"Management changes around quite a bit, long hours, risk of being robbed on a daily basis. Could be a bit more organized. Long days especially if people call off."
bad,"If u work here u will experience discrimination,  period! The management only liked who they like,  every other hard working person who doesn't bow down to their mistreatment suffers daily discrimination of job duties and hours!"
bad,The pay was not worth the amount of risk you had to take every day. Manager never trusted anyone so no one will have you back. Safety is always a concern but never first in priority.
bad,"A typical day at work consist of receiving work for different banks filling order for customer, for messengers to deliver or other carriers."
bad,Nice job for a young woman. Messy environment and management sucks. Work was easy but to stressful of a situation. Dont like adolence problems.Needs new managers. Really. Very high turnover.
bad,On the dock with coworkers was very helpful when you first start working there. Only one supervisor would answer the phone to help out when we were in the field.
bad,this job will pay the bills but you are not compensated for the work that you do and the hours can be long. Sometimes you never feel appreciated.
bad,Brinks is a good company. Brinks is flexible with appointments or urgent family matters. Good luck to new employees who join the company.
bad,It's a good place to wirk if you like staying busy - I have been with this company for 5+ years with NO RAISE and you never feel appreciated even when you know you are doing a fabulous job
bad,"I consistently went above and beyond in the role of money room manager.  Most weeks of my 3 1/2 tenure I'd work 6-7 days, 75-90 hour weeks (on a 45 hr based salary) only to receive minimum support and guidance from corporate upper management.  On average I managed 15-20+ tellers and put Brinks first before my family.  I finally decided that my family deserved my time more as my hard work and dedication were unappreciated and went unnoticed at Brinks."
bad,"Just a job to get it done and leave, no room to improve. Hard to learn due to exceptions and negativity. State an opinion and you will be wrong. But there are a lot of nice people that work there."
bad,"Fast pace and you have to always be aware."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,observer the messenger as they enter and exited the different customer location. Also kept track of how long the messenger spent at each location. Also kept track of mileage traveled each day.
bad,Under the title of “Vault Clerk” I would successfully inventory and distribute a daily cash value of one to three million dollars to our teams responsible for delivering cash funds to our business customers. While working for Brinks I was recognized for my ability to work quickly and accurately under pressure. The hardest part of my job was working in a closed vault without windows or natural sunlight. The most enjoyable part of my job was the occasional travel throughout southern California when I was a driver and the friends I made.
bad,definitely a place to put all of your skills to use. not your typical call center. high pace call center always updating policy and procedures. helping customers daily
bad,"Though the pay at Brinks was good, they did not offer adequate overtime for the 50+ hours worked a week, they also did not seem to comprehend that making a person work a 15hrs shift then have them return the next morning with only 3hrs of sleep was not safe for the employees or the packages being carried."
bad,But i believe this is a job for people without kids younger kids !but its wonderful overtime! and easy job but time management and communication is a little off the edge sometimes
bad,Long hours more of a for older people that doesn't  have a social life. You have a start time but no end time you work more than 8 hours a day with only a 30min lunch break.
bad,Diferencia entre colaboradores con respecto al trabajo y a la remuneraciones
bad,"For Brinks Indianapolis, the pay is good, and your coworkers are great people."
bad,The people were the most enjoyable part of the job. During my tenure I thank Brinks for the advancement and the ability to gain knowledge in many different areas.
bad,There are no set hours of work.  You are informed that your day ends after your work is done and that is rarely an 8 hour workday.  The hardest part of the job can be working 12+ hours.  This is not the ideal job for parents who have obligations with their children such as parenting because your time is spent at work.
bad,"Very supportive management for culture change, but work/life balance is challenging. Overall industry is very low pay to front line employees with undisciplined competition. significant gap between employees and management"
bad,"i help check in the currency i love the mens i worked with i learn the in and outs of the different system,i nice place to work the pay was also good"
bad,"I loved my co-workers but this company has poor management, the pay is not good at all, and there is no room for growth!"
bad,"If you have kids, if you are a student, or if you have second job. This will NOT be  the  place to work. The pay is Great."
bad,"They only get raises in June of each year and if you get hired in June and if you having made your one-year mark then you won't get a raise that year"
bad,"I would drive the same routes each week and would pick up and deliver money to our customers. I learned that most employees of banks are quite kind. Our management was quite good at first then started to go downhill after December. The overall culture of the job because too unpredictable and too stressful. The company's lack of new hires and providing us with help led to many of us leaving. "
bad,Stressful and i wouldnt reapply. I learned how to be well aware and watch my surroundings. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the money and not losing one dollar or else!
bad,"A typical day,"
bad,"Bueno para trabajar en esto, la responsabilidad es muy importante ya que estas a cargo de grandes cantidades de dinero con muy poca seguridad, solo dependes de ti mismo, mas tus dos compañeros, pero solo uno baja contigo, por esto debes estar muy atento a cualquier amenaza, segundo debes ser rápido al momento de cargar un cajero y ser muy seguro en lo que haces , cualquier error podría ocasionar un gran problema que afectaría a muchos usuarios. Aprendí con esta experiencia a confiar en colegas de trabajo, a realizar trabajo en equipo, a rendir el 110 por-ciento cuando se requiere. La gerencia compartía con los trabajadores en todas las fechas especiales, pero no entendía la importancia de cada trabajador, pese a esto los vigilantes manteníamos un buen ambiente de trabajo, cordial  y alegre. Lo mas complicado la peligrosidad de algunos sectores de Santiago. Lo que mas me gusto es que conocí verdaderos amigos con los que mantengo comunicación a la fecha ya que compartimos muchos años en la empresa."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
bad,Brinks tends to have a mix of long or short days. You never know what time you may finish for the day and therefore is difficult to have a good work/life balance. High danger/risk for the pay
good,still working there. not much to say about the work. its a job. thats it. Don't expect much and you'll be ok.. the days are long and the pay is short.
good,What ever this job is just too get bye it’s fast pace hard work and if you don’t meet the numbers they press you by calling you in to the office and tell you if you can’t step up your fired
good,"Poor management, they lie to your face. They don't spread the work evenly. Management does not pay attention to there paper work. They will always ask you to do extra. No overtime and you will work over 40 hours a week."
good,"I used to enjoy working for this company, until it kept me away from home for too long. I don't mean on the road travelling, I mean at the office for 10 plus hours a night. The managers change your schedule without even telling you that they are going to change it."
good,Fun at times but when you think you're done with your day you could possibly be sent out again.
good,The company is trying to get their act together but too many changes in direction and leadership changes even after the company has been taken over by the investors they can't execute the core business.
good,"I mean this is a job. work environment is horrible, extremely rude and disrespectful staff. Management is a joke, I can manage my sock drawer better. So much negativity at Brinks. No one is happy to work for the company. Work days are long and unsatisfying. The most enjoyable part about the job when your not there."
good,"very very very stressful job, its more so managment than the job itself.Every job is hard But when dealing with certain leads it could make your job very aggrivating."
good,Working here gave me a better understanding of why certain procedures on the teller line are put into place to protect the assets of the financial institution.
good,"I have worked here for 7 years now and as it is not a bad company to work in, it is hard to further your work experience. I would like to try something new a different challenge in life."
good,There is constant fear of losing your job. No accountability. A finger-pointing culture with minimal loyalty from both employees and management
good,Brinks is not a bad place to work. It just has really bad hours.
good,Dont work for brinks. Its awful that sums it up. No organization. Managers were ok. Hours are horrible. No room for advancement.  You are not even guaranteed to get off at your scheduled time.
good,Long hours during the day and expected to be available to work seven days the lack of pay for the duties required and they expect to much from their employees
good,"The company is very full of life when it comes to work culture, it takes its image very seriouse and there is no security breaches at all."
good,"Worked in the vault at brinks. The hour was long and pay should’ve been better. They called adding 20 cents to ur pay a raise. Very easy to be fired here.  As if any money goes missing they immediately fire the one they think took it Just to save face of there superiors. If money goes missing then someone has to be fired and usually it’s the small guy. "
good,"While I was there, I had three different branch managers, that was concerning. "
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,Overall Brinks need new management and a policy review. More opportunities for career growth/advancement versus hiring from the outside. Taking cares of the employees and addressing them not devaluing their opinion and having a suitable work schedule. Making sure they are fully staffed versus understaffed and working 15+ hours.
good,Bad management the eployees make the work place they don’t care about nobody personal life unpaid over work they do what they want to do because there’s no union
good,Management was poor.  There were personal issues in the vault and the manager was not educated enough to resolve the issues.  The schedule is stringent.  There was no deviating from it.
good,"travail très intéressant beaucoup de responsabilités "
good,"Management has a lot to work on"
good,I handled over 3 different countries payments. I applied payments and solved any balance problems. Handled collections as well.
good,I worked here in November 2012 as the Currency room supervisor. The staff had their own way of doing things and management didn't get informed. Management tried to change things too fast without standing back and seeing the big picture which led to a few employees leaving the company. I would not go back to this company in a million years and even if you know what froze over.
good,"I worked here for a few months and I want another job already. The pay is good if you are taking care of yourself. I am PT and I don't get any benefits. They try to keep you at a certain amount of hours per week unless they ask you to stay over. When you do stay it's not time and a half. Work holiday for regular pay, Its hard to get overtime. The machines are old. Hope you have a good supervisor because mine was too busy doing other stuff."
good,High turnover job security is very low would not recommend to others who has no military or security background training is inefficient and very little places employees in bad situations no resources or very little.
good,Labor intense job. You have a start time but no stop time to ger off. This job has no security the company lays-off every year. Also management sucks because they dont want to be their.
good,"As easy as it could have been for them to make changes to help with horrible work loads, management chose to not do anything. Resulting in a loss of business and causing lay-offs."
good,"The pay was ok and you make good money here. The major problem was the people. Being in a close environment with a bunch of females it got very catty in their. It was always some drama and the leads never wanted to come when you needed them for an overwrite. They over work you, when your one of the best and expect you to go above and beyond when others just to the minimum but sit in the cook while your doing more then them."
good,Bad management not a good place to work don’t go by corporate rules goes  by the way manger wants it nothing else to say about the place there very raceist
good,Brinks was a good job at first. Had good management for a while. But as time went buy it went down got to be a not so good place to work when i left it had very poor management
good,I was passed over for a promotion it was given to a white coworker that had less experience and that I personally trained for the job. I feel that I was fired because I spoke up.
good,I’ve been at brinks for 10 months and every day I want to quit or physically hurt myself so that I don’t have to go back this place is mentally stressful and it’s hard to have a life out side of work so don’t plan to make Drs visits or go to the dentist or see your family if you don’t have a life it’s right for you the no end time is legit no end time it goes off of work volume Monday’s-  Wednesday Expect to work over 12+ hours Thursday are ok and Friday they only wanna help you because they have the weekend off
good,The job was fun but the hours and pay were to many and not enough. The training was minimum. They need to work on there equipment and facilities to help there employees do there job to best of there ability.
good,"This job would best suit someone young ( early 20s ) looking to get experience to add to a resume. The pay rates would not be beneficial to an older adult with possibly more financial obligations. During my time, leadership members have been friendly, but hardly ever useful. There is severe favoritism within the vault and management is, to put it simply, lazy. Problems that truly affect the company are not resolved. I would only recommend this job as something to look good on a resume when applying for jobs that provide better all around benefits. Also, for how long the shifts often are ( 10+ hours ), a 30 minute lunch and only two 15 minutes breaks is ridiculous."
good,"Good company bad pay long  hrs"
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,the company was a good place to work for but the staff and office people was not as nice and ran a lot of good workers away and  was not very understanding
good,Brinks 100% expects their employees to put them first. Families are expected to suffer in order to ensure Brinks is taken care of. They are constantly short staffed so those who are employed there are forced to stay until all the work is done. They actually stopped scheduling people with times off so they can get away with keeping everyone as long as they want. My family is forced to eat dinner every night at around 7:00-8:00 because I have to stay at work until everything is finished. The supervisors do not have children so they don’t understand or care that families are being affected.
good,"very stressful to work, but if u are single and love working it lots of over time. working there with other employee are very great. but hours working are no time leave."
good,"Its a good job, but fast paced and must meet tough time requirements. I wish we had more holidays off and the pay scale needs to be reevaluated due to the lack of raises the company gives."
good,"Didn't like it. Wouldn't allow me to carry, when everyone else could because inly a certain amount off people can. Really catty employees, pretty much an all female staff."
good,"Your day of work is basic on the public if. Your life is on the line everyday. You have to be aware of your surroundings at all times. Also I deal with a lot of money banks,ATM,local business etc. I see and meet a lot of diffident people on a daily basics as well. One thing about dealing with money you to learn how to watch your back and stay focus at the task at hand."
good,"when I first started working for Brinks I thought I was going to love my job, on the contrary it's nothing like I expected.  Only 5 hours of overtime is a joke. You will work way more than that here. Hard work will go unappreciated. If you try to get your route done early they will keep adding more and more to your workload. The trucks are falling apart and Brinks solution is to band-aid them up so they work but just barely. The only reason I've worked here so long is the fact I have awesome customers on my routes. Furthermore, never try to call in sick or have any family pass while you work here, they will try to guilt you to come to work anyways."
good,"You have no choice but to work overtime, however, only 5 .... FIVE ... only FIVE hours of overtime are paid per week. You will only get 10 hours of overtime per check but you will be working in excess of 100+ hours per check. it's a catch 22, you have to stay on the truck and deliver the money which forces you to do overtime but if you skip stops and bring money back to the branch they are VERY QUICK to fire people. After the 5 hours of overtime your pay goes back to regular pay."
good,"say started you punch in get your gun, load the truck up with coins and inspect truck, drive to accounts that you had listed on your run sheet .. i had learned that you have to work as a unit to make things work."
good,I didn't like working here because the pay was not nearly enough to take care of myself let alone my family too. Don't recommend brinks unless it is a last ditch effect at getting a job.
good,"Respond to customer inquiries and provide data to customers within required time frames."
good,Supervisor and manage a team of safe technicians.
good,"I only liked my job because of a few of my co workers. The pay is not fair due to the physical labor and work condition. Its a easy job but can be agitating as your production can be affected if another co worker is not on their job. Management could have been alot better. "
good,Really not a good place to work bought out our company didn’t raise the pay to their pay management shows favoritism long hours 13.50 to 15.50 really not worth it partner doesn’t have a weapon trucks air not working well 😐 if you got a family you might as well just not see them until your day off routes long starting and the morning ending at almost nighttime no lunch breaks dot rules are a joke if i had To say anything nice it would be a lie just here until I find something better
good,"The job can be lax enough  if you have your own route. Though when others deliberately skip stops and your route happens to be near the skipped areas, the workload gets tossed onto you. Management is more driven to make all stops that they rarely stick up for you when bad things happen like trucks breaking down, mistakes being made by the vault, or being shortchanged by the coin room."
good,"not enough pay, benefits or job security for risk that is taken. You can get fired without remorse. There is no union to help you fight for better pay or work conditions"
good,"It;s complicated to work for remote managers that only looks out for his/her self. Company has policy changes every six months. Manager don't inform employees of changes in a timely manner, etc.."
good,"Typical day - find business, make money"
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,"All he did was send his cronies down to do the easy work in the Binghamton, NY area. And then when it came time for his cronies to do ATM's  they would mess them up and blame others. Lovely people."
good,These type of work conditions are not for everyone.  50 hour work weeks are not recommended for anyone taking college courses or trying to have a decent sleep schedule.  Not a lot of advancement unless you're already in management.
good,"Working on Brink's armored trucks is not a job for the weak willed.  It will be hot, it will be cold, it will stink, it will be cramped.  You need to be able to deal with being constantly aware of your surroundings.  If you have motion sickness, you're not going to make it.  If you need extra time off for kids/school/family issues, you're not going to make it.  Management tries to be fair, but can only do so much when everyone whines and complains.   Upper management comes through every once in a while to make themselves be seen, gives you the smile and nod treatment and leaves, with no impact.  Prepare to work 50-60 hours a week."
good,Managers and coordinators do not have their ideas and knowledge about field work together. they push you a lot to make intense and hard the job. No overtime.
good,"The Company needs, better Management skills, and better pay for what the employees risk everyday going to work, the company also doesn't care for your personal safety."
good,no set time to get off the raises is every 2 years high volume fast paste leaders are very rude they lazy no order you only get 3 sick days its hard to get your days off approve turn over rate is high
good,"typical day at work:5 am until (no set off time)"
good,"10-12 hour days "
good,worked in the mid town NYC office for the Global Services division for  few years. Leadership lacks forward looking concepts and idea's. They are satisfied with the status quo and leadership doesn't produce any forward thinking idea's and they will eventually end up like the dinosaurs or Kodak.
good,"the work dynamic is very interesting. "
good,"The people are what make this company thrive, unfortunatly management fails to appreciate them. With so many changes,  the company is now a very difficult place to work. This is the reason so many people are leaving."
good,"Ok company to work for people with no children or no life. "
good,Is hard to work for Brinks specially if you're a female but you get to know a lot of places and people of different cultures
good,"Load truck and take care of the customers, My job is also to protect the messenger, The responsibility of the truck service is also mine."
good,"the job is great if you like being on the road for extended periods of time, not knowing when your going to get off and having strange hours, the pay is good but the balance and management stink!"
good,long hours all day in a truck most people you work with aren't very friendly
good,"Okay Job for part time not something you wanna do everyday"
good,This was an 8:00 to 5:00 job.  I learned the the money flow process.  The company was poorly managed with poor vission.  I enjoyed my co-workers.   The mos difficult part of the job was the day to day changes in goals.  I enjoyed the hunt for big deals.
good,"In a typical day at work, I make deposits and balance banks. I also help with supervisor function by making coin transactions and balancing the coin afterwards, checking manifest to make sure all bags are closed, help other co-workers with their problems and help them with their bank. "
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,"Bom ambiente agradavel,Aprendi muito temos a oportunidade de aprender quase todos os setores,A direção ja foi ruim hoje esta ótima,Meus colegas colaboram,a parte mais difícil é dia de pico mas da para suportar,a mais agradáveléo companheirismo."
good,"aprendí algo nuevo a lo que no conocía, siempre fui promotor y vendedor, saber lo que soy capaz de hacer y demostrar que no tengo miedo de hacer cosas distintas"
good,"Poor management and heavy work loads makes this job hard to make time for doctors appointments and family events."
good,"When I first started at Brinks, it was a bit difficult to get accustomed to the physical aspect of the job. After a couple weeks it gets easier, and most parts of the job start to make more sense. Not a great place for everyone, but is certainly a unique security type experience. On a positive note, you get to meet a lot of different people and be outside most of the day, but it can be a double edged sword at times. They (Brinks) seem to prefer you work all day over more time at home; many times more than not you will need to cancel or not make plans in the evening. Never knowing when or if they will ""ask"" you to do extra work that will force you to cancel or put off any plans previously made."
good,It's ok...if you have children kiss that time good bye! Always working! You must stay at work until all work is completely fished! Havnt gotten my yearly raise and I'm 8 months past due!
good,"A decent company with great people to work with (probably the best in any company). However, not for anyone who intends to have a life outside of work for those working on the trucks. 13 hours a day on average and constantly changing start times. Not a job for commercial drivers unless you're a new cdl holder looking for work experience. Only paid 10 hours overtime but 60 plus hours is demanded so expect to work for free as a driver."
good,Ok place to work only thing is the pay suck and need help in certain areas but can’t get no one hired to help and the workload becomes stressful at times. Benefits are ok
good,Too many hours and too much stress and no work life balance. The customer interactions were a lot of fun and as long as you could focus on them it was worth coming to work.
good,"Gestion des flux entrants et sortants, gestion des stocks, gestions des litiges clients. Analyse de statistiques de productivité, planification du personnel en adéquation avec la volumétrie de traitement."
good,Brink's as a horrible experience.  The company does not support it's branch managers and does not allow any personal time.  work is expected to be brought home and done at home
good,Long hours. No work life balance. Unlimited overtime. Dirty job. You have a start time but no end time. Family oriented work environment. This is a full-time job not really flexible on hours.
good,"I was a great experience. "
good,"Fast paced work environment. Can be stressful at times. But, on balance, it's a fair company to work for. What's wrong with this company, is what's wrong with every company that put's profits over people."
good,Brinks Inc. is very safety oriented.  this is not a job for someone who is scared or not ready for a challenge.  The employees are very under paid for the job they have to do.  employee put there lives on the line for pennies
good,"Brinks is not a bad place to work, but there are a lot of negative things they possess. They expect you to work unlimited amount of hours, until the job is done."
good,"the hours are long and management really does nothing to help you. A lot of the time you feel as if you have no voice and you have to constantly prove yourself. They have terrible work ethics, praise the people that slack off and are hard on the people that work hard."
good,"Work can be easy and fun if trained proper."
good,"Although Brinks had it's good days like any other, it wasn't the bad days which had me change my mind about the company. I enjoyed going to work and how I was a staple for making things happen, both in and out of my job description. The problem was the amount I was paid for my position and the two positions above me, was very little. It would have taken seven plus years to earn anything liveable beyond a two bedroom apartment (being i started at 10.95, drivers and messengers are at roughly 11.73-1250 hourly)."
good,"Met some of my best friends here. Aside from that it is an absolute horrible place to work. Vault processing have me the from noon to close (9:00 to 10:00pm). Rarely get Saturdays off. Never mind being a parent. No room for advancement at all unless someone leaves. Head management is a joke. Don't do it. Pay really sucks; health insurance is atrocious. Only thing to take away from this company is a 401k, experience, and friendships."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,low pay for the job that you do. required to work more than 40 hours a week with no overtime pay. a typical day is aprox 12 to 15 hour a day
good,"Great work environment, good hours, good pay."
good,"operating forklift on a daily biases  counting, sorting, stacking 50 pound bags of coin, inputting information for coin inventory. i have learned how to input,track,and keep up with large sums of currency.management is OK but could be better. love my co-workers  because we all work as one to finish the job on time. The hardest part of my job is making sure everything is checked and balanced. when everything is checked and balanced."
good,Not good enough pay for the risk.  Too many bosses and none do their job.
good,"Sr. Management can communicate better. Teams are split, so are management."
good,"A typical day is, go to work, get requirements for deliveries, do deliveries, bring deliveries back to branch, check deliveries in, turn in all requirements, and clock out. "
good,work itself was not bad and training was good but the work was open ended and did not work well with family life
good,people I work with are fun to work with.  The management team is not very effective in problem solving.  It is a fast paced enviroment which I enjoy. My hours are very good for my family life which is very important to me.
good,A typical day at Brink's was to take an daily audit of all the money that was been deposited in the vault for that day. Every brink's rep is required to load up the company deposit and have them set up and ready to be delivered for that run on that day. The management team for was ok. The hardest part of this job was staying in a vault all day.
good,"This company has been around for a long time however, they lack consistency in their processes"
good,"Need to pay their empoyee's better base pay 14.10 isn't enough, espcially when your putting your life on the line as a messenger"
good,"Comunicação no desempenho do trabalho traz um resultado com eficiência e eficacia para um bom desenvolvimento das tarefas a serem realizadas,Saber ouvir e acatar sugestões, nos faz crescer, porém parte dificil é quanto mutos procuram crescer a qualquer preço, a ponto de faltar com respeito com o colega de trabalho. Quanto  a direção é importante para uma empresas saudáveis investir nos seus funcionários como a jóia da coroa, como estrelas vivas no teatro da existência."
good,"I worked for Brink's for less than a year and coming from another armored truck company, I already knew the ins and outs of the business. Brink's is a good place to work until you can find something better but not as a career. A typical work day includes driving for 14 to 16 straight hours. The work/life balance is terrible. After 40 hours, your paid overtime pay for 5 hours, and then it reverts back to your regular salary. The work is definitley not worth the pay anymore. The management at all levels is incompetent, poorly mismanaged. The most enjoyable part of the job is driving around in the armored truck."
good,"Managers, wages, and benefits were horrible. The food is good. Co-workers, I love them; I got to know each one of them on a personal level. Qdoba was my second job so if your looking for a job I would recommend them"
good,Review and maintain accurate information on Fixed Assets accordingly from country which is assigned to me.
good,Brink's is a very sensitive corporation that expects nothing but the best from their employees.  Due to the nature of the business security regulations are strict.  The company can be good to work for although the enviroment is stressful at times and can also be dangerous.
good,"La responsabilidad en Brinks es lo fundamental, porque la vida de los trabajadores y los valores que se manejan, pasan directamente por las decisiones que uno tome, lo que hace que uno deba dedicar concentración y entrega en cada turno."
good,"siting for log periods of time no communication with anyone no radio, long hours pay was decent and they help get your hand gun permit but they would change your schedule less then a day away and expect you to drop everything if you have previously made plans and if you couldn't do it on less then 10 hours notice they marked you absent for that day even if you were supposed to be off . the hardest part was sitting and driving with out being able to listen to the radio or talk to the other person in the truck."
good,A typical day at work involves getting everything ready to go on the truck. Inspecting truck to make sure there are no problems before leaving base.
good,"Management is poor. I have worked for this company for a few years and have watched it run straight down hill. The 401k has been dropped to the lowest possible without actually cutting the program all together. The medical and dental for the family plan will cost an employee nearly $625 a month. Management is concerned with their bottom number and thats exactly what you are to them, a number. I have watched so many come and go i couldn't even tell you half their names."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,This job was a great place to work although it had its ups and downs. Every day we performed the same routine. What i learned from this job how to be more responsible. i got along well with my co- workers. The hardest part of the job driving all day with no music inside the truck. but the most enjoyable part of it was we would be considered as officers.
good,Excellent place to start your working career and a good after retirement part time job. Good people enjoyable working conditions that allows you to be with family. But the benefits were not the best not a good career to stick with for time you have to put in towards retirement.
good,"Depending on what your role here is can result in an enjoyable or poor experience. If you're coming from a call center background to a call center position you will likely find it more enjoyable than where you come from.  Also as an entry-level experience, you could definitely do worse to cut your teeth.  If you're looking for advancement in the non-call center portion of the business - prepare to get bogged down and frustrated by politics depending on whom you're under."
good,"This job allows you to handle guns and take on the responsibility of carrying money around. However, don't plan anything much for after work because most of the time you don't know when you'll be off. The pay is decent, but should be more due to the risk."
good,"It’s really not a bad job to have. It was more of the people especially some, not all, in leading positions that makes the job stressful. Daily duties are easy and of course you have to stay focus to meet deadlines. But it’s an easy job."
good,"Management is very poor. On occasion one person is responsible to open as well as closed because others have things to do. At times you are required to work more than 14 hours with no exceptional breaks other than lunch, which only consists on 30-45 minuets."
good,"The job itself isn’t hard, if you’ve handled money doing cashiering you can handle this money it’s just in larger amounts. A plus is you can listen to music, audiobook, or podcast while you process money. You work mostly on your own stuff by yourself and then at the end of the day then you team up to do counts and stuff. They will provide you with uniforms. Some days are better than others, sometimes people are on the ball working hard to get everything done, while other days they just stand around in groups talking about useless stuff while leaving a few people to do the actual work. The reason the turn over is so high is because the new hirers get overwhelmed with the workload. There is a lot of money and a bunch of stuff has to be done to it! Plus you’ll end up work a couple 12 hour days a weekdays! When people move slow it affects everyone! It doesn’t leave much time to get anything done during the weekdays. They give you weekends and bank holidays off However! Every single bank holiday they ask people to come in and if you can’t or don’t they threaten to make you work Saturday! It’s happened every single holiday since I’ve started!  Granted the holidays work are short days but you still don’t really get your three day weekend! They are always short handed and looking for people. Keep in mind it’s not a quick process if you have your interview it could be two weeks before you start you have to pass an extensive background check and pass a drug test and get fingerprinted. They haven’t forgotten about you just takes a while."
good,Need to put in a lot of hours to do well. Great company if you’re an executive but anything less you will work until you have nothing left. Hate to talk bad about any company but it is extremely challenging
good,started out as a fun place but quickly became a negative atmosphere after being named to brinks. There's a lot of selfish attitudes in management. I don't recommend working here.
good,"some of the people you work with there are good people management needs to have better communication with employees, due to lack of communication a lot of the employees were frustrated."
good,There is absolutely no room for advancement...it’s a place for favoritism... if you’re looking to be among sorority types and mean girls... than this is the place for u... good luck... jobs not hard but ...exactly a that a job..
good,You have to work until someone says your done. There’s no end time only a start time. The place is duty and the machines often shut down. It’s assembly line work in a warehouse.
good,"Regardless of entry role, you will be working an average of 55+ hours per week, with only 5 hours per week of overtime pay. Your chances of moving up in the company chain are slim to none. Most positions are filled externally before anyone is notified internally that the position would even be open. Customers are added to routes without any notification, and can easily make your routes last 12+ hours without breaks."
good,"Brinks/Dunbar  could actually be a decent place to work, however Upper management shows little to no loyalty to its long term employees"
good,"It's a fun place to work, you learn new things, to process money, how to count the bag's, where to storage the money, use the pockets to make branches and many more things."
good,aucun management dans cette société et surtout aucune formation  dans ce domaine
good,"It was rewarding to accomplish your daily tasks however, the amount of work you do is not worth the pay. Once you take some time to realize the pay scale, it's not worth working there. I met someone who was there for 3 years longer than I, she only made .30 cents more."
good,"Rules are changed just about every week and are enforced for a month maybe two then are no longer relevant. Communication is not so good and employees are uncomfortable coming to the manager with an issue they may have,"
good,"would love to work at another facility within the brinks culture, I loved the job but the management wasn't great. I will defiantly apply to another brinks and try and see if things have changed for the better"
good,It was a sales job.  I would go to the office to find leads and set up appointments.  I would travel to potential customers homes and sell the security system.
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,management lacked on getting daily routes done and safety wasn't a big concern. Didn't have reliable vehicles. Couldn't follow availability for schedules.
good,"You can learn a lot, people are nice, don't get paid enough to do all the jobs they expect you to. Management is decent. learn alot about money and there security is crazy."
good,This company isn't a bad company at all. If you like to work long hours then this is the job for you. Uniforms are given when hired. So that's a good thing. Work environment is okay.
good,"You are Overworked. "
good,This place was just not for me. They pay u well be you go through alot to get it. The people who train tou in class nñknow what there talking about just some manage need to get changed
good,"My job was a cubical job. All typical cubicle job explanations apply. The work load was extremely heavy. If I was to complete all of my work accurately it would have required another person. I learned a new definition of ""fast paced""."
good,"This job is  very stressful job with a lot of turnover, Security and safety on the streets of Houston is high risk with minimum pay. The training is conducted in two - three weeks but not enough hands on training to learn all the skills needed for the job and equipment on the streets."
good,"Typical work day was 13+ hours. Working for Brinks was an experience beyond experiences. Your day to day mission was pretty much the same, but how long it took you to complete that mission had a lot of variables. This is a money security job which requires you to carry a weapon openly. The personnel working for Brinks were friendly and willing to help each other out when possible."
good,"Pas de vocation aéroportuaire, au second plan dérrière le cash."
good,"This is an okay job. The only good thing to say about this job was the experience is great. Its a very demanding job, you have a set start time but not a set time to get out."
good,"Brinks is possibly one of the worst companies I've worked for. Management/corporate will pinch pennies at all costs. Then, when things break or go wrong it is the hourly employee's fault. Truck repairs must be monetarily approved before the bare minimum repair is done. Drivers over time is capped at 5 hours a week. But, you won't wont learn this until your first pay check. There are too many corner cutting/cheap complaints to list."
good,You never know when you're going to get off work most days. Trucks aren't properly maintained.  People that have been there the longest do what they want. Management decides to hire new people for higher up positions so don't expect any promotions or advancement.
good,Working at brinks is a constant production. A very easy job to catch on to. Most of the time you working more than being social.
good,Be prepared to work extremely hard and be on the move the whole time.  Work hours are long and strenuous.  Not worth the pay and keep in mind you are risking your life moving money.
good,I liked working here the only down fall was that it was very hard for me to schedule doctors appointments or anything important because we got worked like dogs. When I wanted to use my vacation time I was having a hard time because they wouldn't give it to me when I wanted it.
good,"A place where if you work hard you will be promoted. You do have to have open availability to succed. Middle management is poor and feels threatened by strong preformers, but if there is an opening you have to go for it. Turnover is above average and it takes a while to get someone hired(about 5 weeks from application). You can however be promoted all the way up the ranks without a college degree but it is preferred."
good,"I enjoyed working for Brinks, just needed more income. I learned how to monitor my surrounding more. The hardest part of the job was the risk I had to take everyday."
good,"great people poor planning, they killed the team to achieve numbers without looking into the future. they don't plan ahead correctly and trust to much on consultants"
good,"•Money processing – large and small deposits"
good,Brinks is a good company.  They will work with you if you have any out of work issues which is good.  Good luck to all future employees.
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,"If you don't have a family or children it is a pretty good job. 10 to 12hr work days and you can only get paid overtime for 5hrs OT a week, even if you work more."
good,"Brinks has a reputation for being one of the most well known armored car company's in the industry.  Formed partnerships with national and international accounts.  Solutions include armored car, money processing, smart safes, check imaging, ATM services, coin processing, cash management, and payroll card."
good,No time for family because this job consumes most of your day.
good,Have to be a team player in order to get things done. Busy place to work which is nice
good,Brinks Home Security was the company I worked for before changing names 3 times since I left.  It had management turnover that made the environment strange.  Years ago so I have trouble with an entire review.
good,"14,15 horas de trabalho por dia , quando não acontecia algo e passamos disso com muito estresse e peso , trabalhar em equipe , fraca , alguns maravilhosos o trabalho fluía ,outros fracos pro serviço , estresse com os transeuntes e com a empresa , o tempo e brincadeiras com os amigos de trabalho"
good,"Pay is decent. "
good,"Has positives and negatives. Great co-workers, but can be stressfull at times. Periodically may have a long day, but not on a regular basis. Work can be extremely busy and fast paced during certain times."
good,"I've been here for several years, working unlimited hours and times of the day. To work for Brinks company in security transportation was great. Excellent in areas of being aware of your surroundings and taking care of customer product's. But for the high risk I took doing this job, I found that it wasn't worth on any given day that chance of an lost in any aspects from life to valuables."
good,"Long hours"
good,"Very busy and dynamic place to work. You never experience the same day twice with constantly changing schedules and hours. A lot of work to do, so overtime is very common."
good,"Overall not a horrible job, always busy, short on staff. Management was friendly, always try to do more with less."
good,Brinks can be a nice place to work. The money is good if you are good at your job. There is a lot of room for advancement opportunities. The training could be better
good,"Great Leaders and good environment, just the pay needs to increase."
good,"No employees incentives,  No advancement opportunities offered,  No recognition for employees,  Management needs training quarterly to help retain good work ethics within the facility."
good,"My problem became that it consumes your life. There is no work/home balance, it was all work. Great place to work, great environment. You are left to get stuff done alone, so you need to be self motivated. Great work, good pay ( for risking your life you could be compensated better."
good,"At the time I was there, the environment was very toxic. Poor management, a major revolving door for employees and management. 2 CEOs, 5 CIOS, 3 CFOs in 8 years. Tried to change the culture, but my voice was not heard."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,"This job was grueling due to the fact that the hours were unpredictable and the vehicles were very poorly maintained, if at all.  The area covered were huge and the time allowed for the pickups was not reasonable."
good,"Pocoi tiempo en este trabajo, al principio , todo parecia bien, pero despues vi erres administrativos y fallando en termonos de seguridad. no puedo dar un amplio criterio , de la operqacion fuera de PR. Ya que estos se fueron de PR."
good,It was very stressful and faced paced but unfortunately their was a lot of discrimination against caucasion people. The pay was great but a lot of the work was put on one person. It had good benefits and was great for advancement.
good,"Long hours in the day, Management does not listen to employee's needs. High risk of injury.  A typical day of work starts at 6 in the morning and usually will be done around 6 or 7 at night."
good,i enjoy working here . the team is like a family. I have learned that my co workers are dependable and ready. i did not understand the policies of management when it came to safety.the hardest part of this job is the watching out for danger and robbery. the most enjoyable part of the job is working with an excellent group of men.
good,Your always busy and coworkers become a second family.  You have to have trust with your coworkers for them to keep you safe and vice versa. Management is great but they are limited to what they can offer you by higher ups in corporate.
good,"Hardest part was always having to do alot of work on one route which would then become about a 12 to 16 hour work day, then having to wake back up again early in the morning with just a couple hours of sleep"
good,Long hours pay isnt that great but its a job. There is only a start time no end time your off when your done that could be 5:00 P.M or Midnight. So if you have a wife or husband and kids this isn't the job for you.
good,"Typically dealing with money/precious, metals alert security is highly required considering value. I've learned that one must adapt quickly, no two days are alike. Management can be challenging on all levels & Brinks was no exception. The staff @ Brinks is huge, being global as well as out sourcing, co workers are varied  tremendously. One of the more difficult task @ Brinks for myself would be transit in bad weather. Transit in bad weather limits visibility which takes from alertness.One of the more fascinating details of employment would be my safety development. @ Brinks there's a daily reminder to be safe, whether it be through personal experience, experience of a coworker (past/present) & or through an event of competitors."
good,"management was good, but the hours are not for a family person, coworkers really understanding and easy to work with, this was a very physical job"
good,"Brinks is an incredible place to work at and has some of the best people I have worked with that are very dedicate and sincere in helping others blend in to their very flexible and ever changing work environment. The negative aspects are from a few bad management level workers that bend or flat out ignore rules and regulations and turn the work place into a difficult place to work in. There are several legal issues that are never explained correctly or at all. Pay is significantly lower than competitive companies, but provide better resources to compensate. As a company I believe in and support them and I'm glad to be a part of this giant corporation, yet the commute is horrific both ways with the conflict of continuous changing rules that seem to come and go when useful."
good,"The overall there is always work to do, but some days you may work 9 until 6, an 8 hour work day or you may still be working until 8.  There have been days were you're asked to come in early and stay late."
good,"The hours can be long. The harder you work, the more work they make you responsible for. If you master your route and are able to shave time off of the route, they will just add more stops to your route so that you get more done in the original time allotted. Compensation is terrible, considering they don't pay you for overtime after 45 hours. You earn 5 hours of overtime and then drop back down to ""straight pay"" for anything over the 45 hour mark. I made 800 dollars more in 2014 than 2013 but worked 500+ hours to earn that 800 dollars. Do the math."
good,"its a pay check, its good hours and flexible thru the vault and needs improvement on  management and the hours are okay if  you want to be a slave"
good,"No life after been hired by Brink's. Will loose more than 23% of your salary on insurance all other charges. At the end will finished making $60 to $70 a day, after work an average of 14 to 18 hours daily."
good,Typical day consist of manual entries to be billed. Daily billing and customer service calls. Dealing with brinks customers you have to be patient and understanding and make the most effort to effectively rectify the issues and please our customers. Minimal to no supervision is needed on our job and we can work independently as billers. Satisfying the customer is the most rewarding part of the job
good,Brinks is an enjoyable job has many pros and cons. Some of the pros is the amount of hours and flexible hours also the management is nice. The cons is the long hours and not being able to get off at a set time each day.
good,"As you walk in you know your tasks, don't have to wait to get instructions. Management needs to work on communicating with each other and with the employees. Co-workers are very helpful and communicate clearly. Feels like you have no time for yourself or family. Not highly recommended for families with kids. Late shifts; shifts could be from 9- 14 hours a day or more."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,"day to day customer service processing customers deposits, balance and reports to customers inventories."
good,"Os dias de trabalhos eram agradáveis,aprendi muito com toda equipe todos eram muito prestativos e sedia todas as informações que eu precisava para retirada de qualquer duvida,a gerencia da empresa e algo inacessível criando uma barreira entre eles e nos,fiz vários amigo no ambientante de trabalho,que me relaciono ate hoje, a carga horaria excessiva, e relação com todos no trabalho era a melhor parte."
good,"Brinks has the potential for to be a good Company. Benefits are high. No raise since i've started. They only match 1% for 401K. No universal structure. Short staffed, overworked & under paid."
good,"A day at Brinks can be a dangerous day. gotta keep a look out for any potential threat. What I've learned about the job is to be more patient while on the road. Lack of communication between management and employees when it comes to things that need to be done. Love my co-workers,fun and responsible group of people. The hardest part of the job is not being able to communicate with outside world not knowing whats going to happen due the chance of being robbed, being in a car accident, or having family worried when working up to 16 hours a day. the most enjoyable part of the job is driving those big trucks."
good,"Everyday you get to work pre trip your truck for the day. Figure out the route for the day. Get to each stop on the route in a timely safe manner. Watch over your partner for the day, making sure he/she are safe while on a stop."
good,"Na função em que trabalhei, a empresa não dava oportunidade de crescimento, para primeiro emprego é uma oportunidade de adquirir experiência."
good,"This is not a bad place to work, but I had started here when I was offered a the current position that I have now at more money and half the daily driving distance. "
good,"Es un empresa muy grande, la jefatura es mediocre, no recibe críticas y salarios mal remunerados durante los años  1998 a 2003.-"
good,they change your schedule too many times then get mad when you need to request off. they will change your start time the day before and you never know what time you will be done work. so if you have plans dont make them because you will never be able to keep the plans. benefits are horrible as well.
good,My typical day at work was to get their early everyday and put my paper work deliveries according to my route sheet.
good,"Brinks is a very dangerous job, I have to carry a gun on a daily basis. I transport money to banks"
good,"Brinks is a very good company to work. The work is very rewarding, but there are challenges with it being decentralized."
good,Mondays were designated for sales training and field training. Company provided leads and scheduled appointments and required consultants to generate their own leads. Part of the day was spent on appointments and prospecting. Through this experience I learned valuable sales training that would be helpful in the years to come. Co-workers were good team players with a competitive spirit as well as management. The most difficult part of the job was making enough sales to cover cost. The most enjoyable part however was the team spirit.
good,"20 jaar chauffeur-bijrijder: Juiste route inplanning maken i.v.m. tijdsdruk, afstanden. Correct afhandelen overdracht waarden en incasseren van waarden. Ter plekke problemen afhandelen van onjuiste bedragen (doorverwijzen naar direkte leidinggevende of hoofdkantoor). ZIt dagelijks met 1 collega op een van te voren geplande geldauto en route. Zeer hoge concentratie gewenst i.v.m. vaak hoge waarden,veiligheid, overvaldreiging. Vrij grote zelfstandigheid en geen dag of omgeving het zelfde,dus nooit saai."
good,There was no 'typical day'. Everything was on fire at all times and communication was lacking from upper management.
good,"This position OTR driver required transporting large sums of money to various banks, or other branch locations.  Because of content of cargo, vehicles always had to have someone in the vehicle at all times when in service.  Long hours each day with no breaks or lunches.  Also there was no OT pay, which allowed the company to work you 60 hours a week at normal pay.  This caused high turn-over."
good,"There's not much change from day to day, you open and process deposits.  No interaction with customers.  The length of the work day varies depending on the amount of deposits for that day.  Immediate supervisors are good."
good,"I love the company, I just Disliked  SOME Of The people there... I only wish my situation was handle better, But it wasn’t... One thing I don’t put up with is being lied to in my face..."
good,Its cool if its temporary and you like a weekly check. But your underpaid for stressful work.  Its catty but if you like money then nonsense wont bother you. Management doesnt bother you if your on your job. If managers know your a good worker they over work you. I dont understand.
good,"Good job, low pay, long hours. Too many bosses not enough employees. You wear scrubs because it is very dirty work. Not hard just repetitive. You have to pass background check and drug screen."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,The Shared Service Center was not run well. And conflicting strategies and mixed messages.   A lot of inefficiencies and turnover in top management positions
good,"Brink's states the are a work life balance company but they are far from it. To keep up with the demands of my job, on my days off and vacation I had to monitor my emails, projects and take my laptop on vacation. No job separation to give you mental break or any down time. Work required working over 40 hrs to keep up on projects and sometimes required working on Saturday. Ncompgiven"
good,"I was a Armored truck driver for the most part and a messenger,I really liked the benefits the people that worked there and management was pretty cool"
good,This was a fair company for which to work.  The main manager was very good at his job.  The vault manager was not.  She seemed demanding rather than working well with others.
good,"Work is quick paced but not difficult. Recent management changes and corporate decisions have created workplace instability.  However every branch operates differently, so it's worth trying out if you're interested in the industry"
good,"All functions is star early in the morning, load the truck with millions dollars and get ready to get out to start delivery all the places for more 12 hours drive"
good,Great place to work if you’re looking to do something new and different but you will find yourself where you just work and may not gain any growth in company.
good,A typical work day was relaxing due to good management and great co-workers.The ability to work with minimal supervision allowed a calming work environment.
good,Brinks is a fast pace stressful job that requires me to carry a weapon while on duty .  Requires good customer relations and communications with the banks and the stores that I collect money from .
good,The work is rewarding. The company is rebounding for previous poor management teams that viewed Lean as a workforce reduction. The management team brought in in 2016 is doing a great job and retooling the organization for success.
good,"The Job is Good, but the hours can be super long! Be prepared to work a minimum of twelve hours a day as a Driver/Messenger.  Typically Super Late nights for the first couple of months"
good,"Very tedious, repetitive micro managed work. The extra benefits are awesome but in order to earn a decent amount of pay to cover cost of living and other expenses you will need an excess amount of over time, even then that only happens when the turnover rate starts to pick up speed. The turn over rate is always high, due to the lack of concern for family and just the employees on a regular basis.  When ever they are taking new hires they will began to seek out personnel of whom they want to push out the door, so be prepared for a stream line of paper work at once. "
good,"After 2008 Brinks was not a good place to work, lost wages , froze pension.  Was starting to take a downfall from competition, was hiring anyone that could drive. Safety was not a concern anymore, things where different."
good,"A typical day at brinks extremely busy, New money skills was learned daily, management was out of touch as the worklace culture was less diverse, hardest part of the job was making sure of your safety, most enjoyable when all added up correctly."
good,"Employees were great and dedicated to me and my leadership team."
good,"Prise de poste, passages des consignes et des informations, rondes, évaluations des problèmes rencontrés, "
good,Don't really like that they took are over time and don't really like all the new changes with not shovelling the parking lot not giving raises and not caring about how we always got a lot of work with little pay
good,"Environnement informatique innovant et motivant."
good,"job was ok but pay was not the overtime was not paid but overall if u like working long hours the thats the job for you and weekends are very limited,"
good,Check the trucks fluids and inspect for faults then load the liability inside the truck. Deliver to all scheduled stops and return to base. Double-check our inventory and call it a day.
good,I enjoyed my time at Brinks although they are now a part of Loomis it was a very busy workplace friendly staff regular breaks good working environment
good,"very fast paced, 24/7 365 days a year. Very competitive industry, very price competitive . processes and practices behind most other industries . New upper management with better goals and visions for the future."
good,you have Job Security as long as you are on time. if you are looking for a paycheck save your time and theirs and don't apply its not for LAZY PEOPLE... easy work but HARDWORKERS will have an easy job..
good,This job do give you good work experience in the security industry.  It could open doors for you if that's were you want to be. By working for brings it do help you get into the police force or any security agency.
good,"I do hereby declare that the particulars of information and facts stated herein above are true, correct and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief."
good,"the job is ok. but if your looking for one to grow within its not the one. pay is SET 11.50. but it can help you get on your feet. the hours very some days it might not be a full 8 hours. I know me I want to grow within a company and move up and get bonus and increase on hourly pay rather if its every 6 months or yearly ( just something). what you start off with is what your going to be making if you decide to leave. insurance is ok but not all that. I actually went with a outside company for my health insurance, but I went with them for as dental and 401k."
good,"Ambiente de trabajo exijente y de responsabilidad, no valorada por jefatura ."
good,"Mission tres correct"
good,"Nice place to work, open door policy, descent benefits and pay. Must be able to work on deadlines and pay attention to detail."
good,"Productive company and stress workplace, very high security place,"
good,Bonne ambiance avec les collegues mais mauvais management
good,It is not ment to be a career but it would be a good job for a college student or retiery it also would be a good foot in the door to law enforcement agency or other security field.
good,"Although the branch I was at was under going a lot of changes the people there were great!!!! They were always willing to help, teach and assist in your growth with the company!!!!"
good,"Brink's Inc. is a company that is focused on quality service. It is a workplace that demands complete commitment. It is highly demanding physically, but the people I worked with were amazing."
good,"excelente experiencia. logre aprender mucho. es un cargo de alta responsabilidad, y le agradezco mucho a esta empresa por el tiempo que ambos invertimos en el proyecto en el que estaba"
good,"Typical work day begins between 7 am and 9 am and usually lasts 11 to 13 hours. Management team worked hard to make life as easy as possible for employees but the job has to be done. There is a guaranteed start time but no end time as the route times are dependent upon traffic, weather, accidents etc. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employee's who were like family and willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done."
good,"Hours very depending on the time of the year and holidays.  Can be stressful if employees call off, due to staffing shortages.  Minimal involvement by upper management due to trust in employees and above average training for the position."
good,"Brinks was a good company to work for and I had my own department so I really did not have a supervisor, mainly because no one knew anything about how to do my job."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,"Not sure about the middle management.  Not very qualified, but placed in those positions for longevity with the company.  Be careful about who you share your innovative ideas with, they may be stolen."
good,Each day is different and the job keeps you moving around.  Always got to be aware of your surroundings.
good,"Fantastic people, pouring their soles into making the company successful."
good,Brinks only pays 5 hours overtime per week regardless of hours. They found a loophole with DOT and it's being used to outrite rob employees. You could work anywhere from 8-17 hours in a day and you never know when you will be done.
good,Opportunity was always there for the taking. I started as a sales consultant and moved to the General Manager position after 6 years in the business. Good stuff.
good,I liked working here I got to deal with so many people but I was off sick and had a doctors note and they fired me.
good,"brinks, is a job i held for 8 years or so, it helped me support myself, delivery,pickup of valuables, helping customers, driving,"
good,"Learned to be more flexible. Immensely enjoyed working with my cash room supervisor, because we had prior to Brinks, both worked at the main branch for AmSouth Bank. At times- meeting a 2pm deadline for imaged checks was stressful, because the computer based system was new to Brinks. Our cash room enjoyed each Friday ordering lunch in, or when work load was light, we went outside to the grill/picnic area."
good,"Co-workers are hard dedicated employees."
good,"The company has changed owners and management and has not been the same since. Long hour with minimal raises. More work with less help, and then managers complain about hours."
good,"Brinks is a good start to get in to the law enforcement in providing high level security and cash management solutions enables you to more effectively run your daily operations to achieve maximum efficiency to safeguarding of the valuables. An armored guard driver as to be focus at all time. Working at Brinks was an experiment for me I learned things and places that I never image. Management was very poor at getting things together like paper work, valables shipment miss place or worng delivery, as well short period time for lunch or anthing else. I work execllent with all my co-workers I am a great driver with a clean record with no accident. The hardest part of Brinks was working for more then 10 hours a day and coming back to work at any time there were no stable schedule, and salary to low to risk your life. I enjoy working at Brinks is great start for most people."
good,"lo dificil trabajar de noche,aprendi bastante a conocer los billete ,recontar las remesas,lo que me gustaba salir fuera de santiago a pagar los inp"
good,A typical day at work is maintaining a schedule while delivering and receiving packages. I've learned the importance of detailed observations for the means of performance and safety initiatives. I like my immediate management team they are easy to speak to and try to help. My crew is productive and we manage to keep friendly reform while maintaining professional integrity. The hardest part of the job is the element of danger and extended days. We don't have off times at Brinks so its hard to plan around my work schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting and communicating with customers.
good,"Em alguns momentos gosto de trabalhar na brinks, mas no momento quero trabalhar na minha area pedagogia."
good,Very Stressful environment. Hardly any work life balance. A very intense environment
good,Brinks is an ok place to work. You would think that it is a good job and that you are paid well for what you are doing but you are not. They pay is terriblr. My manager and management is good and try to help out as much as they can but the company itself dosen't care about its employees to pay them enough to keep them.
good,"Handling lots of cash and working individually. Management is good but needs more structure, safety needs to be improved inside and outside the building."
good,Can be an ok place to work depending on management like any job. good place for advancement if you prove yourself to the supervisors and command staff
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,"Its ok, fast and slow paced work, they preach safety but lack it. I feel like the management could do a lot better in making sure the employees maintain a safe and enjoyable work day."
good,"Really cool place to work if you understand the industry, fast paced for quick learners. Management wasn't great at first but once corporate stepped in they fixed the problems that kept occurring. Flexibility for those who are single mothers provided you bring back proof. Advancement, transferring, and in house sercurity is possible if you express the interest."
good,"Operate an armored vehicle and oversee the safe pick-up and delivery of cash and valuables. In and out of the truck throughout the day, at your own pace. Potential to carry a decent amount of weight while climbing stairs."
good,It pays the bills and there are some very helpful people here and vise versa. Just keep your nose clean and do what is required and you will be alright.
good,This was a productive workplace for getting my feet wet in my set career of criminal justice . Management does need a bit work but overall got to learn different areas .
good,"I am only part time and  The hours are okay and can be flexible when you have another job for which most of the people work 2 jobs.  Mostly part time employees only a few are full time.  For the work that is required the processed daily the pay is to low."
good,As a vault processor you stand around a lot. Not a fan of the long hours. You check in the deposits that the messengers bring in. Then you also get the deliveries ready for the next day.
good,"I don't have anything to say about Brinks Inc. at this current time. I really don't have anything to say. I left Brinks because the pay was horrible but, the job and the co workers were awesome."
good,I really enjoyed working there. It just got to be too much and not enough help. We needed better help and experience. I was always doing extra work and longer hours for myself.
good,"I's a good job to have but the environment SUCKS!. Supervisors don't know how to supervise. Its like high school all over again. You have set time to come in and you get off whenever they say you can. So you will be working over 10 hour days. Monday thru Friday. They don't have any extra help in case someone calls off. If you have no kids, no life this is the job for you."
good,"I loved it here until things started to go a bit downhill (lowered commission structure, less of that ol' start-up feel, bad leads, complicated client credit checks) but hey I wish everyone the best and I hope they get back on top again. It's not what it used to be but nothing ever is."
good,A typical day at Brinks is pretty much making sure everything is balanced and customer's account are accurate. I've learn to manage many accounts without errors and work environment fast pace. The hardest part is working long hours and most enjoyable part is having the people I work with around me.
good,"During my time at Brinks it was extremely stressful! Employees were looked at as robots, nothing was managed correctly, it didn’t matter if you were in pain from standing you were never offered a chair to rest even after working past 10 hours. You were only allowed to move up if you were one of managements favorites, it was the same with being late, or absent. No janitor to keep things clean, always ran out of soap and tissue, eating area is small and never clean. You were only allowed one 15 minute break and one 30 minute break and I didn’t matter how many hours you worked, cash room stayed behind on meeting deadlines because the vault always lost money. The pay rate sucked for the amount of money you have to touch in one day! I processed millions a day, the pay raise is .10 per year only making 12.50 and hour! Shameful!"
good,"meeting at the office in mornings"
good,brinks is a very good place besides the pay its okay I think the guards should get paid more for risking their lives everyday I believe they deserve more thanks
good,Brinks sells home security. Inbound call center located in Kansas. Leads come from young teenagers. No transparency any longer. Great people to work with but the company doesn't seem to care about the employees any longer.
good,Everyone works as a team. Hard work and very long days of 15 to 16 hours. Management is not the best only the supervisor. Trucks that were driven for work operation were horrible
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,"It is a very fast pace to work there, you are always busy, you go in a 8:00 am and work until you work is done, every body is really friendly. You have time limits, to get deposits done"
good,The company had at one point good incentives but stripped them away which made many of the workers lose interest in working such long and extensive hours. The Brooklyn location also has no Union while the other locations have Unions. Management was constantly changing and was difficult at times to perform your job when getting direction from both Managers and Supervisors wanting you to do different things and allowing rules to be broken when they felt necessary. Had great days working with fellow co-workers who were responsible and professional as well as those you could trust.
good,People come and go very often. New people must work weekends and 4 days a week. you know what time you start but don't know at what time will finish your day.
good,It can be a stressful job for some. I was able to make it through 15 years without incident. You must stay extremely alert at all times. I believe you must also not be enticed by valuables.
good,"During my stay at Brinks the working condition was cordial among employees and employer. "
good,"Never a dull moment when working on a route in town or out of town, Dealing with Banks and all kind of businesses and their change orders and money orders, On routes you can have as many as 4-9 atms that you have to replenish and if one goes down your day can get behind."
good,it is a cool job because you get to work with millions of dollars and are respnsible for a lot of valuable items.  they will also help you get your cpl for free which is probably why people most likely take the job because you are armed.
good,"very fast pace and time management job, extremely stressful. worked long hours and very dangerous job. we had people get killed protecting money. Management did not care about our safety."
good,"Call center ,you clock in and receive first call,and it could be a customers complaints about the system coworker we’re great, management at that time pleasant"
good,"work 4 days a week - mon - thur  12.30 to closing - about 9.30-10.30pm - sit in locked turret monitor people coming in and leaving, checking all personnel bags for people leaving. several cameras stationed inside and outside the building covered by monitors in the turret to constantly review for any suspicious activity - fortunately no serious problems last 10 years - keep log of all outside sources entering building to transact  business with vault - currency personnel.close and lock blding end each day.contact management to have them personally meet with and authorize any unknown outsiders before allowing them to enter building.Hardest part is scanning and checking bags for personnel leaving . enjoy meeting and getting to know new personnel."
good,This place is always very busy but that made the day go by quickly. I worked with a great group of girls and I always felt very comfortable in my work place.
good,"Update new hire information"
good,"nothing special. didn't get the job i actually interviewed for, which made me bitter. and the supervisors looked down on you. "
good,Tuff job. Have a start time but no end time. Heavy lifting. Moving heavy buckets. Quick pace can be dangerous. Always be alert. Have to protect crew and customer products
good,"work long hour, learning new skill with ATM, CIT, and making delivery. being in the height alert with your team. be professional with client and make sure that all currency be delivered on time"
good,"I was a messenger for brinks for a little bit over a year. You don't have set working hours. You work till the job is done, which can be hard to plan other events around."
good,Brink's Home Security is now ADT. I left Brink's before ADT bought them out.  Brinks was a good company and I have nothing bad to say about them.  I enjoyed my time there.
good,"Interesting company to work for and enjoyed their regular training."
good,"Must be to do the following"
good,"Good place to work, just can't support a family on the wages."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new clients in the jewelry industry. Being able to seeing new jewelry design before it hits the market.
good,"The lead cashier position is responsible for maintaining guest service as per company standard, is responsible for the efficient expedition of all guest transactions as well as ensuring guest satisfaction at the service desk and proper control of all cash and media materials in a superstore."
good,The best sales training I have expereinced. B2B sales the only downfall is I was driving my own vehicle and covered a large territory this was over 12 years ago and now the security sales division is no more.
good,"In the morning contact customer to see if they are available to go"
good,"The only complaint I had was about management. Management sucks. They don't care about your lives, just deliveries. The job is a dangerous job. But management doesn't care until someone is actually hurt or killed. Then they'll ""care"". Then the cycle starts all over again."
good,They have been around for 100s of years and I enjoyed working there.  I would work with this company again given the opportunity.  The only reason I quit was because I moved.
good,Management could have been better the lack of care for the drivers was sick. Forcing employees to come in at 5 am and not returning until about 7 pm that is past dot and osha as far as driving hours without a break. Plus no paid overtime
good,The most enjoyable part of the job: opportunity to take on new challenging assignments; possibility to work with different countries around the world and managing cross functional teams.
good,"Le plus agréable, l'échange avec les passager."
good,"I worked hard with great stress. my associates al were helpful and willing. Because of the great social change, and rise in crime, this was the reason for my sepreation from Brinks."
good,"My job qas great the only problem was no advancement in company and no cross training. The employees were great"
good,Très très  bonne formation au cqp et à toutes les procédures de sécurité
good,Its a productive and efficient day for the most.The coin room has a good team of employees and management is also good. The hrdest part of the day see to make sure we balance on what money went out and the money that is coming in. i been working with the same crew of employees for some years now and that make the day go by because we are all close
good,"it was next to impossible to  with clientele with local laws against cold calling, personal contact, or online communication. Canvassing was unlawful."
good,Brinks can be an enjoyable place to work if rules weren't changed on a daily. Managers do not really care for their employees as they should.
good,"Brinks had investments throughout Caribbean and Latin American countries.  While in this position, I inspected and improved the security at various locations and arranged for quarterly training sessions in South Florida where security managers had the opportunity to exchange ideas and methods that ultimately improved risk in their respective countries.  The  process helped reduce the global security cost provided by the Willis Group Holdings plc, a multinational risk advisor and insurance brokerage, based in London.  Unfortunately, government corruption in countries of operation was high."
good,Working for Brinks as a Driver/Messenger gives you the opportunity to provide excellent customer since you are the face of the company. The autonomous work environment is fast paced and ever changing.
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,"el ingreso era a las 06:00 am ingresaban las distintas ruta, se reunía la tripulación para discutir la ruta a realizar, se retiraban los números y dinero correspondiente a los ATM programados (Cajero Automáticos)."
good,"As a teller your in a dirty room processing store deposits, ATM deposits or bagging money for at least 9-12 hours a day. There was a bunch of drama with new employees vs the older ones thats been there for more than 10 years and half are at the retiring age. Change and new procedures will never happen at the Detroit location because everyone is stuck in thier ways and management hangs with the employess. Favorism is throwen around and people lie inorder to prevent you opportunity advancement. The only Good thing is the annual pay raise and the housing raise but if you thinking about advancment this is not the place to be...."
good,"•Drives armored van to transport money and valuables"
good,"A lot of waiting around and ""other duties"" given during the down time.  40-50 hours a week. Scheduling time off was a nightmare.  It was required to schedule time off for the entire year during the fall of the previous year.  Who does that?  Only two holidays off a year, Thanksgiving and Christmas."
good,"24/7 beschikbaar, altijd wanneer er n auto op de weg zit."
good,"Aprendes a trabajar con muchas personas, bajo presión muchas veces."
good,the good part of working at ups was that there was room for advancement. the hours werent that great and the pay wasnt that great but the benefits were and the union was good.
good,A good place to work. I respect each and every employee. We talk and laugh while we work but we get the job done. The company needs structure

good,"The job is very flexible, Good management willing to work around you schedule. The job could get very repetitive as you are doing the same thing everyday."
good,"I worked in the currency processing room. The day to day work was very repetitive and routine. As advancements, would learn new duties. For the most part did deposits, filled orders, and lots and lots of balancing and verifying. Worked til the work was done, so over time happened. The co-workers were difficult to connect with, especially management. Very rude and berating on mistakes or miscommunications, or things not being done just right, instead of being constructive. Lots of gossip and drama. As a woman working with a lot of men, the culture was not very conductive nor appealing. But, I did learn a lot about currency and logistics. Benefits were pretty good (at the time I was there). I left on my own terms to stay home with my kids."
good,"I like working for Brink's,  I like dealing with currency the job is very easy  my day go's by so fast.  By the time I get to look up it's time to go home that's how much work we have to process."
good,"great company "

good,Oversaw the day to day operations of the branch. Dispatched all routes in a timely manner. Learned how build a schedule of 30 people to oversee overtime.  Earned the respect of all my coworkers by leading by example.  The most challenging part was to ensure that everyone has enough hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when all of the crews were back in safely with injuries.
good,Good job if you like Driving the day goes extremely fast and you don't  having to worry about a supervisor telling what to do.
good,Brinks was a wonderful place to work. Until adt aquired them. Everything went down hill. They lie to there customers .
good,"Brink's has been a good employer. My typical day consists of checking out outgoing liability from our vault for delivery first thing in the morning. From there, my driver and I pick up and deliver liability, service various ATMs and electronic safes, and bank out liability at various bank vaults, and store remaining liability back at Brink's vault at the end of the day. Management is decent overall, but if I had to list any criticisms, I would say that I wished they had better communication skills. My coworkers for the most part are very professional and it is generally a pleasure to work with them. The hardest part of this job is never knowing when I would be off work, this has had a huge negative impact on my social life. The best part of my job is that I get to meet so many different customers face to face even if it is only for a few minutes."
good,had alot a traing for firearms by Brinks acadamy and Shane security School by Ohio Peace Officer Training Commission & The Office of The Attorney General.

good,Door-to door sales with some company-set appointments. No longer in existence.
good,"I did'nt work enough time to have a full review. For the time I work here was good, the managers were very open."
good,"A typical day for Brink's was come in say hello to everyone then get to work. Since I had a banking background I needed to learn their daily routine. I did learn how to use their cash machines and coin counter. Management and co-workers very helpful and friendly to work with. The hardest part was the long hours. No set time to be going home. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we would have a snack day. Just kind of graze all day. The first thing, in the morning, I would have a triva question or a silly joke for the day."
good,I delivered money to banks and stores. Drove Truck and guarded messenger.

good,• Data entry
good,"Aprendi a trabalhar em equipe,o dia a dia ás vezes era um pouco acelerado devido a quantidade de serviços em épocas de pagamento. A gerencia era boa muitas vezes ajudando o funcionário, evitando o maximo chegar ao ponto de punir sempre resolvendo da melhor forma as diversas situações relacionadas ao funcionário e a empresa,meus colegas tambem colaboravam bastanter uns para com os outros,a parte mais dificil era quando dava diferença não era frequente mas ás vezes causava um certo stresse. O lado agradavel é que todos trabalhavamos unidos e alegres faziamos comemoraçoes de aniversarios datas especiais e assim descontraia-mos bastante o ambiente."
good,entry level sales job. door to door sales . Good first job for someone looking to get into sales.
good,"Brinks provided a good product to the customer. However, Brinks needed to have the Monitoring department learn more of the Customer Service side of the business so the Monitoring Operator could troubleshoot alarm issues on the phone with the customer instead of transferring them."
good,You work long hours and the pay isnt what it should be for this type of work.
good,"Brinks Home Security is a great company to start a career in sales because, at Brinks, they taught you the skills you needed to succeed in sales."
good,"Considering about my job at brinks was one of my experience that I learn every single day because my duty of this type of job at (Dunbar)and then the brinks corp took over. Security duty it is a serious and top job you have to deal with the currency such as store,retails,and most important deal is at the bank. As a messenger I was capable to do different kinds of duty like lifting more the 50 pound per days or even more. Being the messenger at brinks was the most experience and knowledge, and giving the best secure customer service by moving valuable items such as (cash, coins)."
good,Everyone thier is very nice and it's a big family. Some of the managment is great but their is a boss who is not that great. They constantly change thing and make them harder and the pay is horrible compared to what you are doing. Not worth risking your life for such small pay.
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,The Dunbar-Brinks transition was incredibly rough for the former dunbar team. Compensation was entire dollar amounts less than what was originally promised. Management was hit hard by *technical* demotions with the same amount of responsiblity expected with a pay decrease. Trucks constantly break down and the general work area is dirty.
good,"Nice work place with different departments. If you are meeting your department goals you can go to different departments, but sometimes your pay will go up or down depending on which department you go to."
good,Great place to work. Dont get paid much for the risk you take everyday. Hours are long. Need to have more males working there. Too many females. Need more days off.
good,"It was a good job, the company is shrinking and requires technology to improve service.  Most managers care about their team members.  The VP cares about his people."
good,"Pay is under average. If you're lucky enough to work on the Dealer Care, Accounting or Business Development team, then you're going to like your job for the most part."
good,I do not feel comfortable and would prefer to not leave a review of my current employer due to confidentiality and personal values.  I would be happy to leave a review if i were to find another opportunity
good,The job is not bad just hard to get a routine down until you get your own rout The people who train you some feel as if your a bother more than a help so it can make it awkward
good,"Meetings and high turnover rate, mostly due to low rate of pay and lack of employee benefits. Enjoyed overseeing payroll processing, tax and accounting responsibilities for the company. Too many changes at the top makes for unstable work environment."
good,It just need to be clean up the building old. Feel like dont have team at times. It take up all your time if you have kids its not a good job. I worked in the vault and if its not done you cant leave. Its very stressful at times.
good,"Brink's is a nice company to work for. I can count on busy days that end at the same time. I like the people I work with, and for. My only con about the job is the pay."
good,"It's only been a couple of months, and I can just about do everything there. Overall they can pay more. You are trained to do just about everything in the currency room."

good,Supervising @ 18 tellers coaching them on processing the transactions in a timely manner. Providing excellent customer service to our high maintenance companies and making sure that their currency that was ordered was delivered correctly and on time.
good,"Cool people, BUT pay sucks. They don't pay anybody correctly unless you're on salary. No real advancement. They rather go outside the company to promote people rather than look in house."
good,I would not recommend this company to a friend or family. I think they should show more to the employee then to the management we do not get the credit like we are supposed to no one in the company is satisfied I think in the last 6 months I have seen more then 10 people leave including or Supervisor. What does that tell you
good,"Brink's Inc. Is a Global Leader in Secure transportation and logistics.  Also providing internal banking processes for commercailly contracted customers.  "
good,"Very fun work, I really enjoyed it. The people around you always are with you at all times making sure you have what you need to perform your job. The benefits are great as well as the retirement plan. Is a good company to work for!"
good,"Brinks stopped all 401 K matching and retirement benefits, they also stopped paying overtime once you had worked more than 5 hours in a week... I don't understand how they justified this as it seems to be in violation of federal law but when I asked management they could not explain the companies actions"
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,"I started as a part-time currency processor.  Within 2 years, I was able to advance through company, learning every position available as well as management placement.  I now sit as second in command at the local branch.  The job is very challenging and ever evolving, something I find to be very satisfying.  However the demand from Corporate to be lean and effective does not allow for a quality work/life balance."
good,work long hours every day. Your never doing the same thing one day your use to do something then next is a change. don't get paid enough to risk your life.
good,"Ambiente agradável, com pessoas que dividiam todo o serviço, mas poucos funcionários, o que ocasionava excesso de  trabalho. Serviço muito interessante por aprender como funciona o dinheiro que é enviado por bancos, lojas, hipermercados."

good,Security operations dealing with high volumes of money. Managed routes throughout entire Bay Area.
good,Very structured organization. Safety and security is a priority for all.
good,"Not a bad place to work, great co-workers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with co-workers being shoot or robbed."
good,If I had a chance to work there again I would definitely consider. Very busy but steady and easy work. Different variety of people to work around but pleasant.
good,Easy work with great direct supervisors and people to work with. Its a job. The advancement opportunities do not really exist anymore. It is easy work.
good,"When I was there the company was going through a big transformation.  The whole IT department was replaced and some walked out by security.  "
good,"Brinks is a great place to work. Typical day is correcting billing errors not caused by the billing department with the new system that is in place. Easing the customer's mind that all will be corrected, and services will continue as per the contract. Culture is diverse which makes for good working environment."
good,I like working for the company but you had to fight for a good chair to sit in. When I asked a chair that didn't fall about I was told to go steel one from someone. Good place to work but they need to upgraded their equipment.
good,Filling up cash machines
good,"very physical work, lifting bags of many very heavy, operate bill counter with 12 pockets you were constituently moving from one place to another, not able to take lunch in a decent time."

good,"It was a very fast paced environment with great benefits. There was no career advancement and the pay was not fair. My role was basically a supervisor role in which I did not get paid for, but the ex supervisor did."
good,"For the amount of money earned it isn't worth losing your life for.  Great people to work with, management is a little suspect but still a decent place to work if your looking for something to pass the time."
good,"I had excellent boss/management but overall the company management is extremely poor, bad decisions in new hire process ,and  cut backs on employee benefits while lining their own pockets with bonuses.  This has led to a more dangerous poor working environment and drop in morale.  No real career advancement, now hires outside of company for upward positions ignores qualified personnel within the company.  "
good,"My day at work is characterized by driving my messengers to our customers and making sure that they return home safely everyday and the customers are satisfied."
good,Great company just a little unorganized.  i have worked there for almost three years and did multiple jobs.  the only con is there all for the company and portray not to care about their workers
good,"This place is very fast pace, a lot of work, and it's quite time consuming. It's not a bad place to learn or put your banking skills to the test. The job requires a lot of patience and concentration. Speed also plays in a very important factor, but it slowly comes in time once you have hit 100% accuracy. I have learned a lot from this job, from taking responsibility, following security protocols, how to lead a large team into the right direction when trying to hit very short dead-lines, and many more. Supervising is not an easy task at this job, but it does have a lot of benefits and knowledge. Management is not an easy task, but it could use a few more good pointers. The work environment is not hostile, but it can be a bit rambunctious, especially seeing the same co-worker everyday and spending more time at work than at home. So much gossip is a drag, but it tends to happen no matter where you work."

good,Can not openly discuss the daily routine because of the non-disclosure that I signed. For security reasons as well as safety for the crews.
good,"I like the type of work I do and seeing  how we are moving forward into the electronic age of things. I like knowing what tasks I will have ahead of me for the day but their is usually always something thrown in there to challenge me that day also."

I take incoming calls 50 to 100 phone calls a day.  I have learned how to set up new customers for service, learned about claims, and in the process learning about Money Processing, ATM, & CompuSafe.

good,"good customer service, delivering liability to banks, retail stores, keeping coworkers safe while driving the armor truck, management always on point, the work environment is fun because you always out on the road ."
good,A typical work day at brinks was ok but at times can be very long and stressful.  I've learned how to deal with the public and excellent driving skills being employed with Brinks. Management had a few improvements that was needed but wasn't bad. The hardest part of working here was driving all day. The most enjoyable part of this job was being out on the road seeing and learning different areas of different cities.

good,"A day at work is to drive and wait around , learn how money flows , management not a problem just had to follow instructions as directed. Co workers was little contact .

When I didn't have no trucks, I would empty bags into proper bins and take to coin rolling machines and run rolling machine. Filled customer orders and to inventory of coin room weekly."
good,The job itself is stressful. Long extended work hours. NO work/life balance. Poor management once new manager and branch manager arrived. Management showed favoritism for certain employees. It seemed as if the younger people and those with darker skin were over looked for advancement roles.
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone

good,"I learned the true meaning of security as a Brinks driver because the security of your surroundings, your own self, and your partner will ensure the outcome of your day. Anything can really happen when we are out there and it is up to us to make sure we come home safely. It is a highly stressful job but it all depends on how you handle your days.

Being in a two man crew I thought it would be very boring, instead you are able to build a close relationship with your partner and even create and new good friend."

good,"Helpful and caring coworkers. Reviews are scheduled, paychecks are on time, and career paths can be easier to predict because progression tends to follow a predetermined pattern."
good,This is a good job if you do not have any kids and are willing to work overtime everyday. The people you work with are easy to get along with just the job itself is hard and time consuming.
good,"It's a stressful place to work, but your co-workers are great constantly lifting, you have a start time but there's no ending time, you go home when the works done."

good,"trabajo estrezante  monotono mis colegas bien aprendi a trabajar sin "
good,"Gained much experience in a short period of time with balancing ATM machines and learning CIT routes. Great overtime, time flies as you're working.

good,"Permite trabajar, estudiar y tienen horarios flexibles."
good,"Poste très intéressant, "
good,"great co workers and customers, but the pay does not match your responsibilities and duties. i think if the company paid more they woul not have such a high turn over rate."

good,"very long hours, I've learned a lot playing the lead role at brinks the hardest part about brinks is working 14+ hours a day it takes away from my personal life."
good,"Comme souvent dans les grande entreprises, les opportunités d’évolutions sont importantes, mais les décisions sont très longues."
good,the Hardest part is having time for the family... i was working over 11 hours a day.. but i was making a lot if money.. great benefits and really good coworkers

good,This was the most physically demanding job I have ever had.  Carried a lot of money that I was responsible for on the back of an armored truck.  Loved everyone that I worked with!  It was physically demanding lifting and carrying coin and currency.

I learned alot about counterfeit notes and also how to count large amount of cash with precision.I got along with the management and co-workers really well. The hardest part of my job was no contact with customers as we where locked in a warehouse and had to stay inside for most of the shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around so much cash at such a young age and also learning about all the different currencies.

good,This job was great and I got to learn and perform alot different postions with my time at Brinks. I completed a firearms class and had to qualify on gun range. The highest possible score was 600 and I scored 580. thought that was amazing. As a deposit puller I had the oppurtuntiy to meet alot of customers and learn alot about ATM machinery. Working in the vault was also amazing learning all the customers Brinks had and places they serviced. Really enjoyed my job but due too bank closures my job was consolidated and I was layed off.

good,"management needs a shake down, staff need more benefits as it is hard work with unsocialable hours, but over all a good company sadly the base I worked in closed down and wasn't much help or guidance and they taxed my redundancy so I lost my family tax credits as they thought it was earnings not redundancy."
good,The Job is about your safety and the safety of others. While driving around with large amount of currency your life is always on the line. The only thing that I feel should have been looked at more was the pay rate. But when u need a job you have to follow the rules.
good,The Job was nice. At times it could get hard because of the crimanls that wanted the money that we were transporting. The hardest part of the job was constantly watching your back and looking over your shoulder. My management was great and very helpful.

This job was fun but, there was no room for advancement, and the pay was 9.00 hr. which made me work almost 80 hours a week, leaving no time with my wife."
good,A great part about of the position was the travelling.  I learned a great deal more about the state of New Jersey than I did when I was in high school. I also like working outdoors so that was a perk for me too. Along with that I will really miss my co-workers. we had some good times and some good laughs.
good,the truck side of this company is very straight forward. We pick up and deliver to a set group of customers each day. The money room side is basically a commercial deposit line at a bank on steroids. We process a lot of deposits each day.

good,Brinks was a very good company in my eyes. The hours were there. Sometimes I worked 12 hour shifts everyday. So you can imagine what my checks were looking like every week lol. Good managers. Ok coworkers.
good,"Una empresa en constante crecimiento, líder en el transporte de valores a nivel mundial que ha renovado su visión y valores de acuerdo a las necesidades de crecimiento."
good,"The organization had great senior leadership during the time I worked there."
good,Long hours sometimes.  Very fast paced job.  Not yearly raises.  Raises based on time served not productivity.  Many different nationalities work there.
good,Decent place to work if you like to work hard and work long hours.  Not much of a work/life balance.  Most supervisors have your back and training was great.  Only quit because I found a higher paying position somewhere else.
good,"load all coin star bens on the lift and dump them into the hopper, the coins are sorted in the coin machine and put into bags or bens, you must put the correct number of ben on each skid, and write all the amouts that each skid equals up to, to have the correct paper work when you close out for the end of the day..."
good,"we don't get paid for being targets all day. your life is on the line and they don't pay you enough for the risk that you are taking but other than that its a good job. Its not perfect but not many jobs are. its a great job for young single people with not much responsibility, they will make a killing here."
good,"Having worked in all parts of the operation, I experienced a wide variety of tasks.  The work was very tiring but you never needed to go to the gym after a day of working as a messenger.  Driving was a different type of stress but difficult as well.  The vault work was very stressful for part of the time (while routes were returning or leaving) but was more laid back once items were checked in or out."
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,In my time at Brinks the company was caring and took care of their employees the last year there with new Top Management the company became less caring and more about the ego of the GM.
good,The position I worked wasn't the typical Brinks security job. It was delivery of high value items from the airport. Almost a separate branch known as Brinks Global.
good,"It's a decent company to work for, but the work/life balance is almost non-existant. A typical day at work is processing orders from customers and packing out orders for the next day. Coworkers are great, management is decent. It's a small family-like environment. The hardest part of the job is the weight of the bags you carry around a lot, and the hours and not being able to get things done for home because you are working all business hours all week, and it's difficult to get any time away."
good,I enjoy  working here at Brinks. The staff is great and they care about your well being. Everyone is very helpful and friendly. They could give out better rasies and I think they should go to paying every week .
good,"This is a place were you can learn a lot, and make networks."
good,"Very professional organization. Employees well trained in safety and security procedures."
good,"Typical logistics job covering your day to day duties. Easy going environment with median pay. One of the easiest , straight forward companies there is in terms of work load and laid back atmosphere aside from there few rare times its real busy."
good,"I would go back, how ever long hours. It can be stressful depending on which branch. Very fast pace and challenging. management at the Brooklyn. I would recommend this branch."
good,"I work too many hours with much more responsibility than I am compensated for.  I feel stuck there because I am hopeful to move from my Cash Logistics Lead position to a Branch Manager position, although, one may not open up near me for a very long time."
good,Was fun and kept you busy. Could get boring or annoying when everyone just complained or fought all the time. For the most part everyone is okay and if there is any issues you can go to management and they help fix it.
good,Learned a lot at Brinks.  Got to meet people from all over the world. Always something new happening.  Never a dull moment working for Corporate Headquarters.  My boss was the best.
good,"Muy buen ambiente dentro del trabajo."
good,A typical day working for Brinks is between 9 and 12 hours depending on the job description. The work is not hard but no one has a specific end time. Its pretty much repeating the same process everyday
good,I enjoyed my work very much and my position.  Due to my relocation I had to resign from my position to pursue new avenues. Management was understanding when needing a day off.
good,"Start my day speaking and answer questions with the crews.  Reviewing Kronos, adding missing punches.  Writing disciplinary letters.  Reviewing applications, Phone screens and setting up face to face interviews. Answering emails."
good,"Every day is different day for me where i get to learn new skills which is the best part of my life. I am very much approachable by management if they need me and if there is a problem at work I always like to discus it with ideas and solution."
good,Lot of learning opportunities are hre working in Brinks India. Management is supportive and professional. You enjoy working in office life.
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,"Long hours the management is unfair, no structure, but overall the company has great benefits and room for advancement but again they put the wrong ones in leadership roles"
good,"Brink's is a solid company to work for. There are numerous avenues for career mobility. The pay (in my opinion under some specific circumstances) may not be appropriate for some positions, due to risk/danger. Aside from this, Brink's is a decent employer overall."
good,A typical workday consisted of getting the routes out for work.  I had 22 employees and 11 trucks that i was responsible for.  I learned to deal with different personalities and different work related issues.  My most enjoyable part of my job was keeping my employees safe and making sure my customers were happy.
good,"working with computers, mail room duties, operations for merchandise, handling client and customers needs in sending packages on time."
good,"A typical day for me involves crew members calling and seeking advice on how to resolve problems while on route.  I also handle customer phone calls, research of missing deposits or misdirected deposits.  I also arrange and organize the routing and schedules in order to ensure that we meet and exceed customer expectations.  The hardest part right now with Brinks would be the fact that the sales teams have no help.  They are drowning and it is hurting my branch in particular.  If the sales team was able to do the jobs they are required to do, then the customers would not be leaving in a mass exodus."
good,"Nice place to work unfortunately did not have to show the region expertise."
good,"As a Driver you come in prep your truck that you will be driving all with your partner checking all fluids and any possible issues there might be that may cause your truck to brake down."
good,"Mijn werkzaamheden bestonden uit het ondersteunen van de Head of Security en Head ICT. Denk hierbij aan het organiseren en notuleren van vergaderingen, agendabeheer, uitwerken van poststukken, presentaties etc. Bij deze organisatie heb ik geleerd discreet, integer en ad hoc te werken. Doordat zich soms incidenten in het veld voordeden, waren er veel ad hoc werkzaamheden. Dit zorgde ervoor dat je goed op de hoogte moest zijn van wat er zich binnen de organisatie afspeelde (bijvoorbeeld een overval) en hierop moest anticiperen. Denk dan bijvoorbeeld aan het annuleren van afspraken of juist met spoed bijeenkomsten inplannen voorzien van de benodigde vergaderstukken, vervoer, hotelovernachtingen, lunch etc. Ik heb maar kort bij dit bedrijf gezeten omdat het een tijdelijke functie was, maar ik heb de tijd die ik daar heb doorgebracht al zeer plezierig ervaren, De collega's waren behulpzaam bij het weg wijs maken en er hing een gemoedelijke sfeer."
good,"I view Brink's as an employment that you would not want to make an career out of but suitable to pay the bills while you search for your career. "
good,"Great coworkers, mostly daytime schedule, rotating weekend schedule.  Home with my family the evenings."
good,"During the year I spent here I ran the whole maintenance program for a fleet of 20 armored trucks. The company was more concerned with saving money in every aspect. This is fine if the feet of trucks were in decent condition. I performed all facets of repair with a tight budget for a fleet that had been band-aided together. I had a lot of time to test my troubleshooting skills and that made me better. The age of the fleet also required complete wiring replacements and that in itself sharpened my electrical skills."
good,Brink's is a great place to work with many opportunities to interact with management and global contacts.
good,I have been at Brinks 21 years come Nov. it is a good place to work but really no chance to move up.
good,"Answering phones,make bookings with mine managers. Do fleet logbooks daily. Do quotations and invoicing to clients. Arrange daily flights for Branch Manager for pickup and deliveries."
good,Experienced most of my time in telecom field and learned most of my skills with this company. Company does take pride in customer service and quality of work. However work hard but pay not commensurate to the work that you do.
good,"A typical day involved getting to work early, servicing the truck, loading the truck and then planning our route. Once on the road we stopped at many businesses. We would unload currency off the truck, carry it into the business, take on additional currency from the business, and then finally carry it back to the truck. We would continue to our route was completed."
good,Found co-workers excellent to work with. Management needs to be willing to reinstruct rather than discharge. Especially with the aprox. 1500 + trainig ivestment better cost savings plus more stable workforce. Check their current. Job listings nation wide otherwise a good company. Training program very good.
good,"A typical work day began at 5am to 5pm. I learned to coordinate and dissmenate crucial cash reconcilation, pick and delivery schedules. I learned the responsibility of carrying a weapon and how to make split second decision based on my observations of the environment. The hardest part of the job was riding in an armoured truck for 10-12hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was geeting a look at how money moves in the financial sector."
good,"it was a fair company, I enjoyed working there. once you get your route and a good partner you are ok. there are days when you work alone but if you demand a partner you will get one and you will be fine. Overtime sucks though because they don't want to pay more than 10 hours OT"
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,A great environment to work in allowing creative sales skills to be utilized. The most enjoyable part of the job was  developing and expanding new customers relationships.
good,I liked working with this company as there was a lot of different people involved within the company and whether you were English speaking or non english speaking as 1st language there were ways of communicating with each other and were treated as 1 of the family
good,"Everything about your day at Brinks is technically confidential but it's very similar to any delivery driver just with money and confidential documents, hard drives, and bank information. As a messenger you are exposed to any threat that is seeking what you have or just curious about what in the truck, it is more common than you think. A job in which you must stay focused, at all times, paying attention to little details with your financial ledger, time management, and surroundings. You're in charge of balancing the money in the truck and the vault will verify. Taught me logistics very well, and honed my skills on understanding commerce and flow of money."
good,The stress level of recording the company’s assets became too much. I moved into training which gave me more time to develop my skills in management.  Overall working for the company is challenging but it just like every other company it has good and bad aspects. If I need to do it again then I would.
good,You have good opportunities for salaries but not if you want to get of the phones. Recently started hiring managers from the outside and that doesn't seem like a good idea for the type of job we do. Retention is pretty bad.
good,"Πολυ καλη εργασιακη εμπειρια"
good,"The Brink's Company is an Iconic brand and industry leader in the secure logistics space. "
good,"I wasn't looking forward to working for this company; however, once I was hired on I ended up staying for seven years, and only left because new management were laying off senior members. Most of the employees there are helpful and willing to work with each other to get the job done. The benefits are great, the pay is good for the industry it is in, and the majority management is fair, reasonable, and willing to help as much as they can to make sure your safety is taken seriously."
good,"takes a little time to get the hang of doing drops and pickups, doesn't pay enough for the job hazards. holiday work is very stressful. everyone wants money and you are the money man. keep your eyes peeled because more often than not someone will attempt a robbery."
good,You start work at 6 am and you don't leave until your route is finished. The hours are long and unpredictable. It is really hard to plan anything. I loved the job and my co-workers. I would work there again if I had the opportunity.
good,Strong company with quality employees. I supervised multiple facilities over the years and saw a wide variety of management styles. Some facilities were sub standard but I saw managers making the best with the poor conditions.
good,Work is steady pace. There's a lot to do and a lot to learn but work is not hard. Must be able to lift up to 50 lbs. and able to stand for long periods of time. Company is a good place to work if under the right management.
good,"The hardest part about this job is that you will always know your start time however, the end time is always unknown. An average day may be between 7 and 13 hours."
good,Overall it's a good company to work for.  I've been there now going on 8 years.   I've been doing the downtown area for 5 years now.  I have met so many people along the way.
good,"I worked for this company for 7 years, but there was no room to grow and expand within the company. So I made a choice after 7 years to make a some changes and I left to continue my education in Criminal Justice"
good,Great place to work and be part of the Brink's family.  The industry continues to challenge Brink's but they are always looking for innovated ways to lead the industry.
good,Brinks was probably my favorite job ive ever held down. management was nice crew was chill. days go by stops and not just solely off hours. recommend this job to people who work alone
good,"Overall a good company to work for. There is strong job security and hours are always available, routes averaging around 50 hrs per week. Only downside is there is no set clock out/ end time. You finish when you complete your route. That could be 1500 or 2100 depending on the day/volume."
good,Easy job. I've heard they've become more lenient there now allowing beards and headphones which wasn't allowed when I was there. I assume this makes working a better experience. Subject to unnecessary drama at job. Good pay and benefits and job security.
good,Working for brinks was fun and hard working. The people there were great to work with always helping one another. You got to carry a gun and that was fun bc i missed carrying one from being in the service.
good,Great company to work for. Great with their employees as well as balanced between home and work. Positive environment and customer service based. Constant meetings on improvement for both internal and external customers.customers. Definitely growing in the right direction.
good,"Brinks has been a wonderful place to work and I love my job, but the hours do not leave much time for family or anything else outside of work."
good,"A good day at work is that you have your work shipments organize in the armored truck. What I've learned is speed, accuracy, and timing. Management is very professional. Co-workers are respectful. The hardest part of the job is servicing A.T.M.'s. The most enjoying part of the job is meeting different customers on a daily basis."
good,"Overall I really like Brinks but want to return to regular, full-time employment as contracting does not really suit me. I have tried for several months now but prefer regular full-time work."
good,"Well there is good teamwork with the company. People would give assistance when you need it. benefits are starting to pick up a bit, but on a pay freeze for another year. Management are good kinda. they work with you but are by the books if you want to have a day off. either take a day without pay or use the only 5 sick days in the year to pay for that day you want off. "
good,"I designed & sold burglar, fire, and medical emergency alarm systems & security monitoring products to clients in both residential and commercial markets. I developed, grew and managed new and existing accounts by generating new sales leads via cold calling, door knocking, trade shows, networking events, canvassing, direct mail, social media, etc."
good,"you work 10-12 hours a day, at least. supervisors are available either in person or over the phone. the employees are friendly. working long hours and handling a large amount of money was the hardest part. i learn to keep everything organized and make sure that the paper work is legible"
good,Learned there are places where bosses care more about their employees and do not act like you are a pawn that works for them. They want your opinions and advice to make the work places better. Made things that are harder on you easier by adapting the job to make it easier for the person doing it without going against how the job is done.
good,"tower guard,  know  your duties  and enjoy working there control, great job."
good,"Working at Brinks was good learning experience where my day started by checking emails resolving queries,preparing revenue bills and passing entries for the same in the accounting systems.During my tenure i got familiar with accounting and MIS systems like Sun Systems,Vision, BITS,etc.I worked in the receivables department of Gold and Silver line of business with a highly motivated and hardworking team and my manager having an experience of 13 years in the same department.I was also given the opportunity to work on different profiles simultaneously for further exposure and getting the work done."
good,overall a decent workplace. decent pay with a lot of stress.
good,"Responsibilities included safely driving and controlling the Brink’s armored vehicle to and from various customer pick-up and delivery locations in an armed environment. Other associated tasks involved delivering, picking up and reconciling valuables at a customer’s location; constantly maintaining the highest degree of security and control of the customer shipment; maintaining radio communication with the vehicle crew and dispatching personnel to ensure a secure transaction; loading and unloading the armored vehicle; reporting all faults experienced during the day’s activity; completing appropriate driving/delivery documentation; maintaining a courteous and professional demeanor while performing daily customer interactions; reconciling customer deposits and receipts of all valuables handled throughout the daily scheduled run and covering for other money room positions as needed."
good,Unfortunately I married someone in Customer Care that is against company policy...
good,"Learned about Troubleshooting"
good,"A typical day at work is 10+ hours, you never know what time is leaving time. I've learned time management, how to multi-task, and how to push through the obstacles. My coworkers are like family. We may not always agree, but we get the job done."
good,"A typical day a work is very stress full because your life is on the line from the moment you leave the branch. The best way to remain calm and make your job enjoyable is to trust your driver and your instincts. What i've learned about this job is to always be aware of your surroundings at all times and always have a plan of escape. One of the best things about working with Brinks is that i used to work with great co-workers and showed you that they had your back at all times. The hardest part of the job is not knowing if some one is looking at you and trying to plan an attack. The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers, we all treated our selfs like a big family."
good,"This was a great stepping stone for future working endeavors. A very challenging sales position, only for those that are extremely self-motivated. I worked six days a week, even holding appointments starting at 8pm to make a sale. Now, Brinks provided plenty of resources to make you succeed. They assisted in allowing me to be part of Scottsdale, Phoenix, Mesa, and Gilbert Chamber of Commerces. Also, I attended regular trade shows all across the Phoenix Metroplex. I was able to master how to sale and market myself, as well as, my company."

good,"Pros"
good,"Really enjoyed the culture and people at Brink's. May have been one of the most rewarding work experiences I've had in my long career - specially because of my co-workers and the work we were doing. The company was under high pressure financially, but now has turned the corner and I see good things ahead. The CEO is someone that leads well and people enjoy following."
good,I am looking for better job opportunities. The transition from the buyout dunbar to brinks was nerve wrecking. The staff was rude and it was not fulfilling our promised salary.

good,"My time at Brink's was very good, with the exception to my experience with the hr department. When I spoke to my hr department there about my benefits package, which was very expensive, I was informed that they would only be taking money out of my check once a month to pay for it which I was ok with. But after my benefits started it soon became apparent that money was being taken out of every check to pay for them, there was no way that I could afford this and when I asked if I could change my package I was informed that they apologized for the mistake but that I could not change it until the next year. Because of this I had no choice but to find another job."

good,"As my experience was all based in international services this was the first time I learned about local logistics and cash processing in a production line, so for me it was one of the most important things in my career."
good,"Good job with decent benefits and pay raise scale. There is overtime if you want it and the days fly by. Great job, great people overall. Management has the habit of turning over very often, but when ever money is involved any were that happens a lot. Job security is iffy, being that brinks is contract based and other companies can, will and often do under cut brinks."

good,"Arriving at work early in the morning to open the facility I helped set up the routes for operation.  My immediate supervisor depended on me to be available for this necessity.  Reviewing the orders for delivery prior to departure for the routes was a requirement to ensure  customer satisfaction.  It was a real pleasure to know and work closely with these highly motivated people - We DEPENDED on each other.  Trust was vital.  At times traffic would inhibit our delivery times, however our proactive communication enabled us, as a unit, to overcome these occurrences and still fulfill our dedication to our clients.

good,While my time here was short(8 months)I developed personal connections with my brothers and sisters at arms.The knowledge and experience gained by working within this branch of security is incomparable.I have had law enforcement officers ask me questions of my understanding of certain situational  awareness responses.If you believe that you are physically and mentally prepared for such a demanding position then i would recommend applying.But let it be known this type of work suits single people who arent confined by time schedules.Because the day can change quickly and you may wind up investing more hours than expected.

There are usually about 30-40 stops a day, which have to be done within a certain time limit. There is a mensenger that rides along with me to process each stop. Once all the stops have been completed, I head back to base to unload the packages and take full inventory.

good,"fast paced"
good,"A typical day at work for me is driving an armored truck all day. Management at my particular branch is cool, they interact with the employees and all of them have been promoted except for one. So i guess its safe to say that they promote from within. The hardest part of the job for me is staying awake considering all my stops are out of town. 2 hour drives at 630 am is not fun."
good,"As of 2016-2017 the company kept making dramatic changes which lead to  the laid-off of a big group of people who worked for the support of Latin-America financial operations.

Management is friendly and have a great rapport with their employees.  The hardest part of this job is dealing with the unpredictable scheduling."
good,"Typical day at brinks is signing and counting money in the money to make sure the delieveries are accurate. We would service Atms gas stations banks and retailers. One thing ive learned from brinks is how to develop great customer service skills. due to the fact you were the companies sales person you sold great service to the customers. you dealt with them every single day and built a great relationship with them. hardest part of the job , would definetly be the stress of when your transporting alot of money in very rough neighbor hoods. most enjoyable part of the job was developing amazing relationships with the clients."

good,This company is great in certain regions of the US. In the bigger branches there is room for advancement and opportunity but in the smaller branches there is very little.

good,A typical day could last anywhere from 8 hrs to 15 hrs. I learned a lot about the way logistics work. The management was ruff at time we had a lot of turnover in management. Co-workers were the same as anywhere some were great and others you just had to make it through the day. Driving long distances with no radio or any entertainment was tuff.

good,"I loved working here but the work/life balance was definitely not a thing. It's better that you don't have a relationship or kids if you want to work here. But the pay was worth the time and there was always opportunities for growth. I would jump at every opportunity I could get. It's just you'd work 10 to 20 hour a day. It got to be a bit much for me. But you'd always have the weekends off with Saturday as an option to work, paid holiday while working. You were treated well, just the hours. I couldn't handle it.

You are providing a valuable service and your attention to detail will allow your friends to go home to their families every night at the end of the shift.

good,"A basic work day starts with you coming in to the building and putting your gun belt on, next you would receive your weapon and your money for the route, then you count your bags of money to go out and match that number up with a manifest and last came loading your coin. The hardest part of the would have to be the customers that order and ship out a lot of coin."
good,"The type of job was always dangerous and required absolute attention, precision and honesty. The managers are fine, but will offer no flexibility if you are in school. Financially, the place is incredible and you can garner quite a lot. The hours are long but if you mind going in and out of trucks or sitting for long periods, this type of work is fine."
good,days were not too typical here anything could happen a machine breaks down or get odd orders but overall I think me and my co workers handled everyday the best we could.

I learned so much in the 9 years that I worked there and it was over-whelming at times, but it was very beneficial.

good,Typically you stop at Banks and businesses to pick up deposit or leave money for the client. The management is very supportive and understanding of the job requirements. The worse thing about the job is other drivers in the public do not realize that the truck's do not stop easily. The hour's of operations is not bad and there is room for overtime if you want it. I fully enjoyed my co workers and the job.

good,You can learn every aspect of the job and advance by being versatile.  Management is very flexible with day to day demands and work with you for your schedule.
