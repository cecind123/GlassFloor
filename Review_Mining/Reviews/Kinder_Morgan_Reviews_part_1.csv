rating,review
bad,"This is probably the worst company I’ve ever worked for. You’ll see favoritism, racism and how hr picks the managements side on any and everything. Higher ups are jealous of their employees for whatever reason. They only look out for their friends. I’ve never worked in such a toxic work environment in my life."
bad,"horrible management in kinder very deceitful boss,and secretary nothing but 2 faced people they constantly talked about others and tryed to intimidate them created very unsafe environment also I would have had a lawsuit against them but chose not too"
bad,"I work here  ..it Sucks. Currently looking for other work"
bad,Terminal management is horrible and has a lot of shady stuff going on. Workers are worked to the max hours and then more. Very bad decision makers in management. When management changed last time the terminal/refinery relationship has plummeted
bad,the bosses are smart mouths the pay sucks theyll lie to about stuff hard to move up dont give raises. very very very scrict got drive 7 miles down some horrible   roads
bad,"There is no work life balance at this place.  Management is Horrible.  Ethics and Compliance serves no purpose."
bad,Racism! No room for advancement would not recommend ANYBODY TO WORK AT KINDER MORGAN GEISMAR LA!!!!!! Mangement are racist white men brain balser and ty richy!!!! Please stay away!!!
bad,"If you like to Terrorized by a Hostile Work Environment."
bad,The company has no concern for you whatsoever. Manager favor other less qualified employees as a safety net for themselves. I would avoid this company.
bad,"No chance for advancement. Management treated grown men like animals. Just work and dont aak questions. Easy to get fired. No stable work hours. Safety is non existent. They preach safety in meeting, but the whole operation is dangerous and unsafe."
bad,I worked there for a short while and management was so cruel I spent many evenings crying because of the way i was treated.  They thought it was funny and enjoyed treating me horribly.
bad,Many unethical people working in positions of power and this spreads like a cancer through out company.  Lack of cooperation between business units and managers.
bad,"treated the helpers like DOGS. unsafe working conditions and never will you get a raise of benefits. worst job i ever had. the experience was unreal. Pueblo, CO"
bad,"Horrible place to work at. Poor management and a lot of favoritism.This company is big on trying to micromanage their personal. If your a vet trying to earn a degree, don't count on this company to support you."
bad,"as a former employee I can say the payroll department is rude, unhelpful and not worried about you."
bad,"You will only go far here if you are family or who your drinking buddies are hard work is not awarded here,if you're not in the click you get kicked to the curb,this place is ran by idiots I have not seen a place ran like this in the 37yrs in the work force.This place needs a good House cleaning (Pier 9)."
bad,Terrible company!! Does not follow their own ethics rules.  Supervisors abuse their authority and corporate does nothing.  Supervisors are known to discuss personal health matters on conference calls.
bad,This place is a horrible place to work for. No leadership whats so ever. Management is a joke was wrote up two times while in training for no reason at all. Was lied on by the foreman several times. Place is a death trap. Racism is not hidden. There is a strong dislike for blacks. Your will be picked on if your new. This place is ran by a bunch of dummies. Trust me the $26.79 they pay is not worth it.
bad,"Judging from these very positive last few comments, I would say the company has people posting them to bolster its image.  They are having a hard time finding people who want to work there.  Here's my take:"
bad,"This company is top loaded, if you look at the job opportunities, always top heavy with supervisory personnel, upper and middle management saps the energy from this company. Even today they have a ""compensation director' listed for employment, they have no clue what to pay their employees??? That it sad when you cannot survey the industry without some high salaried director to lead it. These upper management people sap the bonuses, taking all the monies dedicated for bonuses for themselves."
bad,"your work is constrained by a myriad of policies and procedures, there is no room for improvement since you are constrained so tightly. The operations people all get paid essentially the same, so no one gets merit raises, so there is no reason to improve or enhance anything. If you have a better way of doing something and came from another bought out company, you are told 'this is Kinder Morgan' we bought you attitude. And KM will make you well aware that you were bought out, bought out employees do not advance, seldom promoted, and get little opportunities."
bad,They constantly talk about safety but wont spend money to make unsafe things safe. Safety devices are disconnected and bypassed when equipment shuts down.
bad,First things first. The company’s core principals are a joke. They were broken daily at Queen City Terminal. Safety was only a priority when corporate or a visiting company was around. Tanks were allowed to leak all over the ground with no plans to fix. The management is awful. The only way to advance at QCT is to brown nose and snitch on other employees. Those that do brown nose get all promotions. You are made to sign a document saying they have a one strike policy. The turn over is ridiculous because they fire everyone. Basically you are treated like a prisoner. My advice would be to keep looking. This company is terrible to work for.
bad,"Generally speaking, a good job to have. Other than that a hostile work environment where you're reminded daily by management that you are only a number. A typical day at work is hard to determine, because it varies daily. Completely based on customer priority, you will be told that overtime is NOT optional. Can't go home until the job is done. Entry level petroleum terminal job. Some supervisors are young and don't even know most general questions you may have. Good benefits, but low pay. Raises are very rare. Operators come and go. Senior operators are less than 5 years experience at the terminal. New rules and regulations are implemented weekly sometimes multiple times a week, therefore its hard to stay up to date on site specific procedures."
bad,"They like so many other companies only care about one thing, the bottom line. The management does not want your opinions or feedback, but a body that does what they are told. Very bad leadership."
bad,The worst job I ever had. Management at the terminal was horrible. They treated you like children most of the time. 4 employees left in 4 months. They ruled by intimidation not motivation. Human Resources was in the plant on numerous occasions because employees would call the ethics hotline to make a complaint on management. Nothing was done. Bottom line. Don't work here unless your willing to take verbal abuse on a daily basis.
bad,"Avoid if possible, but of you are desperate it can be a good place to get experience and get your foot in the door of the industry. Due to high turnover they hire often and usually don't require much previous experience (especially for ex military). Management lacks any sense of professionalism and runs a system based on fear and blame, employees are not provided with any sense of value or job security."
bad,"Kinder Morgan likes to think of themselves as a good company, but in my own experience, their corporate ideals means that women are not  tapped for anything but ""traditional"" female positions - HR and similar roles.  Because of that, the men in this company treat women as if they are stuck in the 50's - in stereotypically male fashion."
bad,"This company is no place to work if you are looking for advancement! They will find any excuse not to promote you, give you your raise or bonus. The bottom of the totem pole employees are severely underpaid. Their attitude is you're lucky to have a job. As someone else stated they are MILES behind in technology, so you're doing your job by hand. They will praise you when you're up but one mistake and they will NEVER forget it. They don't encourage continued education to help you do your job, lots of favoritism of course. You will only get in certain departments based on who you know, but beware once you leave....don't use them as a reference!"
bad,"dont ever work for this company if you require any kind of personal life. your good deeds and work ethic will go unnoticed while any little mistake will scrutinized to the smallest detail. Nepotism runs rampant and you will never make as much money as someone who works half as hard as you does. Say goodbye to weekends and holidays, which you will be forced to work with little notice and no leeway. You will be lied to repeatedly, threatened daily and generally treated as a second class citizen"
bad,Lowest paid contractors in the refinery. Kinder Morgan dont care if you got flooded and have no where to go they want you to show up for work. They dont care if you have plans on your days off they will schedule you to work at the last minute. There is no set way to promote up it changes as soon as you get the time to get a raise.
bad,"Kinder Morgan is a very driven company, which could be a good thing or a bad thing. As a shareholder its good that the companies are very driven towards goals and numbers, as an employee that means you get zero work-life balance, work days are long, and manager only cares about what you produce. There is no training and they joke that the lack of training is the ""kinder way""..."
bad,Mid and lower management were treated horrible. Overloaded constantly and using PTO was frowned upon. Nothing good to say about the site I was at. No defined role or training of expectation or directive. What was good for the goose was not for the gander.
bad,"New President came in and cleaned house,"
bad,Horrible company to work for! Management is probably the worst Ive ever worked with. Its a miracle they haven't had more incidents then they do. I would not recommend working for them.
bad,The work itself is easy and well worth the pay. But when working there management and employees is only out for their own good. If you commit a mistake they will throw you under the bus faster than you can admit to it. They run it like a military one person messes up everyone get punished. Managment is a joke they come and go as they please when you take a problem to them they let everyone know who said something. HR is a joke you ask a question they dont know answers. They force you to work when it's not your weekend. They play favoritism with certain operators and brother n laws. Also they let tanks and valves leak right on the ground with no concern to the environment or employee safety.I would recommend to find some where else in my opinion. Benefits are decent and pay is decent but not really worth the head ache.
bad,"The management in the houston downtown office does a poor job of explaining objectives, and cannot be bothered to coach a new employee how to give them a product they see worthy of their time. Micromanaging and belittling are their methods of leadership. Even when you comply with requests you can still be written up for not if the manager is of that opinion. HR for Kinder Morgan has no confidentiality standards that they keep, nor do they stand up for employees."
bad,"Poor support staff (EHS, Quality, Engineering, etc.). You are by yourself. Extremely difficult to grow unless you have a sponsor or a buddy in the management. No credit to knowledge or education."
bad,"under performing, no value added managements from top to bottom, wasteful expenditures from the  over staffed personnel which may be under paid and not well educated, not well trained to do their jobs.  The culture may have cascated down from the top, and became a culture, need a shake down from top to bottom, IT department in particular."
bad,"If KM is your only employment option then don't stop looking for another job."
bad,"After working with this company for about a year, it became evident that what was promised in the interview was not going to happen.  The good managers get out of there as quickly as possible, leaving only poor management.  I regret this job and would strongly recommend considering all options prior to taking any position with this company.  HR is a joke here as well."
bad,Dangerous Place to work and not worth the little pay. Save yourself and apply with the refinery. Good guys to work with on the coke drums they should be making better pay for the experience they have.. Bottom line don't waste your time.
bad,"I worked as a Maintenance Supervisor and this was indeed the worst atmosphere I have ever seen.  The management just spends it's entire time covering for each other.  They have no concept how to run their company.  The entire culture is threatening and demeaning.  Swearing and yelling was the norm here.  If I could give less than one star overall, I would"
bad,management is terrible.  no schedule to speak of.  decent pay.  no advancement.  dead end job
bad,"Good place to work other than a communist atmosphere! Terminal manager was a egotistic jerk, who didnt have a clue! The terminal manager was more like a prison warden! Hr preached safety but could care less!"
bad,"operate equipment in the movement of material  i learned different equipment ,management does not care about the employees ,the hardest part od=f the job is going there every day ,the best part of the job is going home"
bad,"Was let go after one incident. I had never been written up, late, called in sick yet there are tons of people that have been in trouble and are still employed.. Discrimination at its finest"
bad,Stay away if you are looking for a meaningful career. Management does not want or appreciate new ideas. The systems are basically from the early 90s and it's unlikely they will be upgraded soon. The culture is that of the 1970s at best. You will have job security because people keep leaving. Advancement maybe but if you have to relocate be prepared for an awful relocation package. Company morale is low and management does not care. They have the be happy you got a job mentality. Raises are between 2-3% while upper management continues to get paid through stock from record profits.
bad,They will not tolerate your opinion; it's only their way.
bad,"it was just a job, and i worked there 13 years and now with new management the company brought in new people and started to replace the old crew"
bad,As a new employee they treat you like a dog and won't help you out. When you get into a bind also all of the current employees there are anti social and you don't get a welcome feeling I hate I even came to kinder morgan because the communication there is horrible I wouldn't. Refer anyone to the company and they also have a no fault policy were you can't miss anydays of work even if its an emergency. I would just stay away if I was anybody applying
bad,Constant redirection on work projects and way too many unproductive meetings. More time spent on preparing presentations for meetings and information for management than on productive work. No company-sponsored events or sports teams. No attempt to build camaraderie. Individuals had to pay for own meals when lunches held for retiring employees.
bad,"When interviewed, I never over sold my skillset. I am a Lawson admin that was willing to learn and support new applications. Instead of being given any Lawson tasks, I was placed on a very stressful and unsuccessful Kronos project as well as supporting their current time keeping software, HBS. These are 2 apps that I've never touched. I was tasked to install 2 patches in Kronos Dev and given directions to do so. I followed the directions not realizing that when I installed the 2nd patch that it uninstalled the first one. Honest mistake not fully understanding the Kronos management console. I got raked across the coals for that. Not taking into consideration that I've never done this before!"
bad,"If you want to be treated like a number. Then Kinder Morgan is the place for you!! Do you like management who will sell you down the river and couldn’t care less about you or your family? Well then sign on up!!! Do you like policies that are changed on a management whim , well I’m sure Kinder Morgan has a place for you! Or wait how about being rushed on every task but “ officially “ your not rushed , well you’d love it here!! And remember kids safety is priority only when it looks good on paper. And big brother has nothing on Kinder Morgan, cameras at every spot you can imagine and a plant manager who watches 24-7 and try’s to catch people so he can fire them ."
bad,"After nearly 10 years of service, no one could pay me or compensate me enough to work for these scumbags again.  There are a lot of good and decent people working for this company trapped in a cycle of lies and deceit."
bad,"Look elsewhere first. If you are lucky enough to get in good with a manager or director, you are golden.  When you start your job at Kendall Morgan, keep your mouth shut and listen.  They don't like know it alls!"
bad,"My married boss hit on me and when I refused he found every reason to get rid of me. They talk about core values but as far as moral values they have none. There is no in house promotions, they hire outside guys and use their supervisory roles to step on people. I was a very hard worker never taking any unreasonable vacation days and my boss never appreciated any of it. The company has no intentions of putting money into truck loading equipment that breaks down everyday and the truck drivers are there for at least 3 hours. Iv'e heard every single one of them complain. Manning is always short and when they bring in a ship over the weekend, you will work whether you like it or not."
bad,same as other review for kinder morgan job. watch your back and dont make any mistakes.
bad,Employees suck managers d*cks and managers only really on employee feedback. It's a union so everyone does what they want and everything it's based off seniority.
bad,Management has gone downhill. HR will always side with management. HUGE turnover of engineers in crude and condensate. Overwork the good employees while giving credit to the bad ones. When you are on vacation you are still expected to answer your phone and deal with issues.
bad,You have a lot of opportunity to advance if you are willing to relocate and be highly motivated and willing to work a lot of overtime and be subject to be on call 24/5
bad,Poor Management and lack of maintenance on terminals.  Managers where not knowledgeable.  Will ultimately lead to accidents and equipment failures at the sight.
bad,"Run. Place seems nice. But the operators are mostly inexperienced and aren't getting any better. If you look at someone the wrong way, it's an HR call. "
bad,Management was promoted from within the company. Not qualified to be in charge of people. He had no people skills and put his favorites in charge in his absence. The same people who did dangerous things when he wasn't looking. Not people you want working around loaded pipelines.
bad,I worked for this company for many years and was treated like scum at the end of my career with the company. I no longer fit in with the click and did not want to follow the rules and policies. The upper management will pressure you into do the wrong thing even though they preach for everyone to do the right thing. Overall just a bad company and no one will make a long term career here unless you are the executive management.
bad,"The environment at the Philadelphia Terminal is one of low to almost no morale. Management couldn't run a McDonald's, let alone a million dollar chemical terminal. "
bad,"Kinder Morgan is a pipeline company that promised great career and advancement opportunity... but when it boiled down to it, at the compressor station i worked at, it boiled down to ONE particular employees opinion of you... if you were liked... you were helped, if not, you were not helped or trained, and allowed to fall on your face.... my past jobs i have never had any issues learning and doing my job properly, but due to the lack of proper training because of one persons opinion of me, i was left without guidance and allowed to fail and eventually get terminated."
bad,"No review "
bad,"Poor management, I would work here to gain experience then go somewhere else, turnaround rate is high as ever, all the overtime you can get if you want"
bad,Management is horrible in the Goldsmith CPF wouldn't was your time applying there. Management is always against you and will deny everything they say.
bad,"For the most part workers get along well and get the job done, with no help from management. Met a lot of good people working here, and proud to call some friends! "
bad,KM is a backwards thinking company who treats its employees as a necessary evil for making money. Officers and executives get the good money and perks. Line staff is left to fight over the scraps.
bad,"Very threatening and unrealistic deadlines set, always hold everything possible they can over your head due in fact management hasn't a clue whats going on and need always to provide themselves an out for their own job security. Very poor ethics promise the world to get commitment from you and never fulfill their end once ours is met!!, constantly rearranging benefits so much so its cheaper to get govt. Obama care and personal IRA and fair out better in the end. Hear same for most all KM branches throughout south Louisiana. Only good point is due to serious management hostility and unprofessionalism have made some very dear friends and always looking to help one another till you get fortunate enough for a better opportunity which is from most anywhere else. Recently increased pay rate substantially and is still lowest paid liquid bulk storage through put facility up or down the river. Only pro is you can gain terminal experience to get better paying job else where with better everything!"
bad,"This company manages it's people through fear and intimidation.  They frown on communication and an open exchange of ideas.  The CEO speaks about growth in terms of millions and billions of dollars, yet annual pay rate increases are figured in pennies. "
bad,"The culture at Kinder Morgan is outdated.  The staff is expected to work heavy on projects, but the compensation is comparatively low compared to the industry standards."
bad,the pay is a joke you might start at 19hr if your lucky . very slim chance of moving up to the liquid side if they hired you at bulk that is where you'll be staying. One of the so called crew leader does nothing handout  his job other people over half the people there are related to him some how . just do your job and don't get hurt or they'll can you real quick . i would stay away from KM bulk side so anything with heavy equipment operator run cause you will not get paid what you think you should make
bad,"Very bad management,have old wore out equipment that they expect you run even though they know it isnt safe.Or legal.But they have found loopholes to keep it running.You write up the equipment for moths before they might fix it.They will fire u in a second over so called safty.But if tou refuse to do the job over a safty issue,such as a portable ladder broke,that will make it harder for a coworker.You will get ur butt chewed out.I loved the job i did.I learned not to bring your problems to your supervisor or you will be chewed out.Dont waste your time writing stuff up.As for management they want it all on paper.Everything perfect but only to cover there.Not for there workers.As for my co workers,they were very enjoyable to work with.The hardest part of job was dealing with the boss.I loved the job as long as i could stay away from the bosses.I could go on and on,but wouldnt do any good."
bad,"This is the hotel California. You can check in anytime, but you can never leave. You will never get promoted in this job. 25 year employees don't even make it out. All though I understand in a way because after 25 years here, those guys are nut jobs. The moment you step into this job your going full steam. Day after day, it's the same thing. When the slightest thing happens, you find yourself peeing in a cup and three managers asking if your stupid. I have been fortunate in not having that expeirience yet. If you take a shift job there, live as close as possible to were you work. You will be working 14 hour days with no breaks. Labor laws don't apply here. Nobody comes to Kinder Morgan with experience. Everyone in the industry avoids this place like the Plage. There's no morality in management here. From being taken on expensive trips by costermers, to fooling around with the 20 year old assistants, they run a muc. This place is moraly corrupt. It makes sense though, Rich Kinder was a Enron executive."
bad,Employees are not appreciated especially if you work in the control room. Job security is not a definite you make one mistake and management will try to get rid of you.
bad,"For the Houston area this company will pay you well below the area salary by $10,000 per year by operators standards. Plus you work way more with less of a crew and with management for mid to upper not even caring about its employees. Now if you do anything wrong your gone but if they mess up will its ok. Would not recommend this job to anyone accept for someone that is old or new a need a start."
bad,the schedule is beyond unpredictable.  Regularly unsure of our schedule less than 24 hours ahead.  The work is monotonous and boring.  Same thing everyday
bad,"They have a sytem called ""Do the Right Thing Everday"". Which is a joke. The company doesnt even abide by there own ""Six Core Principles. They have these in place for there benefit only. They use these core principles against you so they are not at fault. If something goes wrong or someone is injured they munipulate anything and everything so they are not at fault. I had the HR department say to me, ""We are here for your protection and to protect the employees"". I ask them do I pay you or does the company. They had no response. Management in the company is not qualified for the postions they are in. If you are smarter or have any brains they will try to get rid of you. They have a huge legal team in place. When I say huge I mean HUGE! A Co-Worker was injured on the job a few months back. As a witness, it was not his fault. They took the situation and have tried to turn it against him just because he got legal advice about his situation. Everything was fine untill he seaked legal advice. Management has tried and is still trying everything they can to fire him. They have even asked employees to watch him so they can write him up. I had a senior manager tell me, ""He p*ssed them off when he got a lawyer, They are going to fire him any way they can"". The company has a safety bonus program. They put money on walmart cards every three months, now its a chase prepaid card. At the end of the year, on the last pay check they took out taxes for the whole year. It ended up making some people only have a $54 check the week after Christmas. All in all this company is not here for there employees."
bad,Shift work. Work independently. Trouble shoot pipelines.
bad,"It's a stable job, they have made such a bad reputation in my area that people aren't exactly bearing down the door.  The pay and benefits are mediocor at best.  The management team is so grossly inexperienced it's really not even funny.  The superintendent landed his job because the company was desperate, oh and his dad was a supervisor.  Theyconstit'sThanksgividinner."
bad,"Lack of direction, long hours, no concern for private life. People are not willing to help. Not sure what they want from you and they expect you to know the processes and procedures as soon as you walk in the door."
bad,Always hiring. Can not keep people..Should be enough reason to stay away. Racism is rampant. The training program is a joke and the system is dated. Just stay away.
bad,"Employees are not valued, Management does nothing to promote team work or provide training or tools to do job effectively. All decisions are made based on money and usually short sited."
bad,I’ve worked here for 8 years and I’ve not advanced in years.. once you get to a certain point you just can’t adavnce anymore. They don’t wanna come off any money. Poor management. And working 12+ hours with no lunch.
bad,"If you can stomach the politics, policies that only apply to those who they want them to, long hours, long work weeks, and no life outside the fenced in walls, go for it."
bad,It was a difficult environment to work in as the tax director was not invested in the process and left most of the work to the senior manager who did not communicate well to the staff.
bad,"Unorganized as it relates to scheduling for Trucks on both sides of facility.  Management treats you like a number.  Not about what you do right, its all about what you do wrong being emphasized!"
bad,"The company seems to have a overall positive climate however the upper management in the AP department as well as HR needs training and help. Very poorly educated and HR is biased and does not actively understand their role. Lots of favortism, nepotism, and ""who you know advancement"" going on as education is not a required tool for advancement which is why there are so many unqualified upper management in this department. Overall I would say that this one department is poorly managed and there is little to no room for advancement if you're not a favorite. Seek other opportunities if you disagree with micromanagement as this is the climate for this department."
bad,"Management wants ""yes men"".  Any disagreement with management viewed as negative attitude.  No commitment to process improvement - content to do things ""the same old way"".  No attempt by company to build camaraderie - no company softball/bowling/etc. teams."
bad,"management does not do a very good job of stopping their out of line employees. Aside from that, the actual work itself is enjoyable. You are always working and upgrading flow computers to the latest technology."
bad,"The pay was okay. Communication, organization, and management was horrible..... Coworkers were good for the most part."
bad,"A unique way of cost reporting, earned value and scheduling"
bad,over worked and under payed for what they ask you to do plus bad management.
bad,"Worked as an operator for 5 years. Managment doesn't care about you, and some of their supervisors don't know their way out of a paper sack (Victoria Supervisor). Your just a number with Kinder Morgan"
bad,The accounts payable dept is pure hell! Replace all management in the ap dept and it would be a nice place to spend 8 or more hours of your day!
bad,"Management in charge destroyed one side of the organization.  Weak leader poor and timely decision making.  Was removed and assigned to manage another side of the organization, fast forward two years now this part of the organization is in shambles and people are leaving.  Blue collar management style treat you like hourly workers."
bad,Offers adequate pay and benefits but long hours and alternating shift diminish quality of life.  Poor management and outside hiring instead of internal promotion add to the poor morale.  Hazardous work environment at the Portland facility including peeling lead based paint int he warehouse and deteriorating floor tiles with asbestos fibers.
bad,"will train you in any job you are able to win a bid for and equipment training is open for everyone as they advance through time served. "
bad,"No management or communication, and only verbal safety and cost focused. Under experienced PM Department. Contractors are not treated fairly when they say it is a competitive market."
bad,"By far one of the worst places ive worked. 12 hours shifts 7 days a week with no days off in sight.NO LIFE, no set schedule. 6a-6p or 6p-6a. understaffed and overworked. Never had a manager sit in an interview and tell me moral was low until I came here. you are at the mercy of the railroad and never know when you are going to be off. Hot, dirty, and physical work."
bad,"Hired into position through an acquisition, my experience was high stress job with long hours due to unusual circumstances and lack of liquid terminal experience within upper management."
bad,Start early work late.I have not learned much from km as there training is terrible.Lot of new managers that dont know what to do as they come from another feild of work.Co workers were very hard working bunch of guys.The work never bothered me management had no clue of how to run the crew .Dealing with customers meeting new people and helping them when they were haveing a bad day.
bad,Work Environment Pretty good.Most people good to work with.Management at terminal does not use employees to their strengths and weaknesses.Under constant sterss if you make a mistake you will be loose your job.
bad,"There was a lack of training while trying to perform complex work. The favorites get all of the rewards and there is no work/life balance. Management is clueless and uninvolved. However, good pay for this city's average and that is what keeps people there."
bad,"Worked at KM for several years and felt like years more than I actually was there. Lots of time spent working on nights and weekends & it was expected because others did so. No one else I worked with had children so they did not understand that sometimes you have to take time off and not be at work (nights, weekends, holidays, PTO). I am a strong believer in developing local talent, but KM likes to develop and promise pay bumps & keep stringing along the good workers.  They like to reward to workers who may be good enough at there job, but if you bust your butt day in and day out you seem to be left out of the perks that come with being the same ""orientation"" as others you work with. I have never been the victim of reverse discrimination, but that was the last straw that pushed me to leave for a much better workplace...it wasn't hard to find one."
bad,"You could work alot of hours.  Plenty of overtime if wanted.  Long days.  Especially for a dock man.  12 to 14 hrs per day.  The problem at Kinder Morgan Harvey and other Sites,  the ppe matrix is overkill.  Lot of it was unnecessary.   Never work with a full crew.  Always short,   and management just didn't notice it.  They expected way too much from there employees .   You just feel so drained and tired .  The schedule sucked we worked.  No life.  I don't recommend kinder Morgan to anyone unless you have no other choice at a job.  And your bonuses,  lol,  suck."
bad,"Natural gas processing plant, lots to learn, but you are on your own as far as learning all the processes, whether out in the plant or on the control board. There is no organized training, no taking operators out in the plant to show them how things run, or how different equipment plays into the process. "
bad,Allowed to create a great team and cohesive culture. Empowered team to strategically advance challenging project. Great potential for significant future growth
bad,"Hours are great, and you are off on the weekends.  Most employees are very helpful and professional.  As with any office setting, you always have a few bad apples that ruin the bunch.  A few office employees were exceptionally unprofessional and rude to the point of face to face arguing with other employees while customers witnessed said events."
bad,"Great pay, horrible management.  Stay away from the cliques if you do work here."
bad,"Poor safety record"
bad,managers are micro managing the employees. cost cutting on budgets. employees are loaded with so much daily tasks. doest give job securities for future. management are always at defensive
bad,stand in front of machine all day. lift up bags of fertilizer an stack on pallet.
bad,I really love the place first year. But realized there's an extreme ammount of turnover and poor lower and middle management practices. Will gain a lot of knowledge from daily tasks. Will also have to sometimes develop your own procedures as they aren't always clearly defined.
bad,"Pro: Good balance of job security and compensation."
bad,Questionable Management. For the most part management  don’t know how to manage its available resources. The turn over at this workplace is high. The work  site needs to be upgraded.
bad,"At the Fairless Hills location you will either be getting worked to death unloading ships or be doing something so boring and monotonous, like shoveling sediment off of the sidewalk for weeks on end.  The company is extremely frugal regardless of how much money is earned.  Management will make life threatening errors and then not own up to them when called out.  You may get hired to operate heavy equipment, but be prepared to shovel for years before you actually get into any equipment."
bad,"Toxic environment management is terrible "
bad,"It was a fast pace stressful work environment with very little to no breaks within a 12 hour period. If they put you on nights, more than likely thats where you'll stay. Putting in PTO was a hassle considering they rarely approved it."
bad,"No training for employees, KM prefers to hire experience.  No employee perks other than what is required by law.   Company culture is to save money everywhere possible.   Read almost any of the Forbes ""what a workplace shouldn't be"" type articles and realize that this is likely the place being written about."
bad,"Dealing with the labour, and learning was an experience. Dealing with the consistency between loads was enough to have and be satisfied with however the management was never interested in fair"
bad,"They keep a very thin staff. long hours, always on-call. below average pay. the managers micro manage. they are always changing their mind on what qualifies for your bonuses each year, they are not consistent."
bad,"Huge turnover in the last 5 years strictly due to Management in the Edmonton region. Poor personal and coach skills. "
bad,Good benefits but management does not know how to manage at the terminal manager level and up to the VP. Too quick to pass judgement without knowing the facts. Good ole boy network is always in play.
bad,"Very fast passed days, management not aware of everyday duties of their employees nor have most ever even done the duties, and co-workers are the best"
bad,work was fun and easy co workers were great and direct supervisor was awesome but policy and upper management were horrible
bad,"KM is a pretty good place to work but alot of Management issues and they think they're better than you I have to watch your back,lots of turn over and I see why"
bad,"not a favorite place for me,very far and few for advancement,nice people ,you know when youll be home and go to work.set schelduel. big engines a lot of heat"
bad,"Every day is different, you come to work not knowing what is broke. Don't get trained you have ask questions, or won't know anything. management is a joke. co-works are good. Don't do a lot of hard work lots of maintenance. best part of the job are days when nothing is broke and things operate smoothly."
bad,"I wanted to pipeline, that's where I started. I was under payed and over worked. Prob would have been different if they had pay for experience. But they didn't."
bad,"okay to work with. didnt work for them, was working with an outside sub contractor. "
bad,KM is a very stressful place to work. I would not wish working here on my enemies. I was laid off via phone call after 6 years with the company. This is typical business with Kinder Morgan.
bad,"Bad management, dictatorship, No direction, and lots of people taking handouts, I used to work on this project and was glad to apply and accept a transfer, to another entity within KM."
bad,You have job security but no work-life balance.
good,Compensation for salary employees are not fair based on responsibility.if you have an engineering degree your offered long term incintives but just a business degree you get direct reports and no other incintives
good,will be forced to do a two man job that is required in contract by yourself !
good,It's fine if you want to work 6-7 days a week and be under paid.
good,"Facility is using a business model that doesn't address the age of the facility (mechanicals, equipment, infrastructure), or the workforce being employed. The management structure is one of get it done, no excuses or no mistakes. Mistakes will get you terminated without due process or addressing a solution to the root cause. Some departments are held to a different standard and subject to termination of its members at a drop of a dime.  Tension in the air all the time."
good,A culture of pure overt hypocrisy. Mistakes are dealth with by firing the employee rather than examining the situation and rendering corrective training.  When potential problems are brought to their attention. They are usually  ignored until that problem occurs. Then an employee is often left on an island. Upper management is fine with a fire to success model.
good,Corporate culture is 10 years behind the times. Management does not encourage or promote innovation or free thinking. The company has a lot of potential if management would focus more on growing the business instead of looking ways to save a few dollars through cuts to operations
good,"Management was lackluster across the board with no definitive goals set for the completions team. Day to day operations changed on the fly with no given notice. Lack of professional communication in your daily walk prohibited effective, proficient success."
good,"Great pay when there is work, but after 2008, there is not much work there."
good,work hours range from un expected day off to 18 hour days subject to change at a moments notice.  Management preaches safety and threatens write ups but only follows policies when it is beneficial to them.  good pay and great benefits.  no room for growth unless your willing to relocate and good luck having local managers sign off on your transfer.
good,"The work is good work, yet you're always there. being on vessel schedule means you cannot plan anything, and you are always working with little to no breaks. is not for everyone."
good,Kinder Morgan management was horrible. They want you to check in every fifteen minutes. If you do not follow the direct path that the management says then they will not like it and yell at you because you didn't follow exactly what they said to do.
good,"Entire company philosophy is to blame anyone for everything, especially if upper management is involved. There are NO accidents, every single one is someone's fault and they must be purged from the company. Zero tolerance for mistakes."
good,"your only a number here but the pay is good. The management has no clue how to run the facility in an orderly fashion, they also do not treat people very well and are not personal."
good,Although there are financial rewards the industry is so regulated that compliance is the majority focus.  Hard driving goals and expectations to achieve them 100 percent takes the fun out.
good,"Little to know thinking ""outside the box"", everything is done in accordance with procedures. At times management doesn't know as much as the employees beneath them."
good,A typical work day with Kinder Morgan is fast paced and they effectively harness a work safety culture. It is a great place to learn and expand upon your job skills within the pipelines and terminals community.
good,"Management avoids safety and warehouses are falling apart,the condition of the equipment is poor,faulty and very poor,they talk a lot about safety and sign safety reports but the building warehouses and trucks loading stations in very poor conditions"
good,I went from one terminal that cared about me and that I became like brothers with to another terminal where they took the words from a guy who been there for about a year verses than me whos been there for about 6 years.
good,"The Products Control Room is a shift worker's nightmare. It's unfortunate that the management of the products pipeline group continues to operate in a reactionary state rather than a proactive manner. If you love having your work schedule changed constantly, being pulled off of special projects because there is never a full staff, missing promotions because management is incompetent and doesn't staff properly, than this is the place for you. Otherwise, seek employment elsewhere."
good,Good place to work if stability is your only requirement. Most jobs do not require more than a high school diploma which favors internal relationships greatly. A lot of external hiring and no training/development plans for their employees.
good,A lot of confusion following El Paso Merger. More time will be needed to analysis process and procedures.
good,"Management was switched two years ago and moral went down , With the right management this could be a place you don't mind going to spend 8 to 12 hrs a day and collect a check .....Must get used to working in all weather conditions"
good,"Most unprofessional, disorganized place I have been employed.  Supervision resorts to name calling with derogatory names.  Office bullying with micro managing from two levels above.  Lack of confidence in employees.  Safety concerns and injuries are swept under the carpet.  No chance for advancement.  Manager applied for a lateral move to be closer to aging parents and grand children and was denied."
good,I very much enjoyed working with my fellow colleagues at Kinder Morgan. Each day was productive and highly demanding but I appreciated working in a team oriented environment.
good,"Good place to work if you want to stay in the same position for your entire career.  If you do a lot of ""Brown Nosing"" you will get promotions, no matter whether you are good at your job or not.  If you are a hard worker and keep your mouth shut you will keep your job, but if you seek a promotion because you have had a long career with them and worked hard, you will be terminated at the first opportunity.  So if you get a job with them, keep your mouth shut if you want to keep your job and if you want to get a promotion be sure to do a lot of butt kissing."
good,What I liked best about the company is the casual dress code.  The salary was pretty good.  There was no racial diversity in the office.  Too much profanity.
good,"Local terminal if fine, but they go through management like crazy.  There is no job that is non-union that is safe.  The management will lie to your face and do anything to save their jobs.  Pay here is good because we are union.  The benefits are ok."
good,Liked working downtown and met alot of nice people. Learned new language in contracts working with power plants. Was laid off here due to the economy.
good,"This company does not take care of their employees, only cares about their bottom line.  The communication from employee to management is terrible.  The Management passes the buck any chance it gets and will make the employee the fall guy.  they make promises and do not follow through. promotions and raises are very difficult to achieve, but they will pile on more work regardless.  Even when company makes a multi billion dollar surplus, they still docked employees bonuses."
good,"When I started you wanted to come to work now I can't wait to leave if you have a good idea don't share it, save you the rejection, if you don't like management stay away your going to see them often, they have allowed HR, to run the place. Going under soon run as fast and as hard as you can"
good,"The company is a pipeline company, so the environment was industrial.  Few perks, my break room did not have a sink, and the water cooler was filled from the tap.  I was kept on as part time, even though I often worked 40 hour weeks, no benefits, no paid time off, no sick time.  I worked through a temp agency.  A typical day at work involved turning on the instruments and running the standards, then testing samples.  Gasoline, Diesel, and jet fuel with ASTM protocols."
good,management doesn't follow the company policies.  the pay is good but you work long hours and there is no set schedule.
good,"I was put in a position that was set up for failure."
good,Good people to work around . Site management maintains a safe and healthy workplace. Site personnel works hard to ensure the site maintains compliance with all agencies.
good,"very competitive and the management appears to have their best interest before the worker bee.  I would NOT work there again. The management at KMI lacks vision and is reactionary. In my department changes are made to appear as if the change is necessary, however, it tends to be quite unproductive and unnecessary."
good,"not a very safety oriented company, lots of shortcuts are taken, management doesn't seem to know a lot about the work we do, seems very stressful here every day"
good,"Very stressful, not very open to ideas from the ""little people"", the location I was at was profit andbudget first then safety"
good,Good benefits with competitive pay. From my experience it is hard to make advancements. Kinder Morgan purchased El Paso Corp. Kinder Morgan's pay and bonuses are not as healthy as El Paso's.
good,Kinder Morgan believes in running the groups very lean. You will have a very heavy workload and each year there are new acquisitions or projects that continuously add to your list of responsibilities.  There  are not very large bonuses and raises are below standard.
good,The managers are very disrespectful and use inappropriate language.
good,Unloading material was fun for the most part. I have learned to deal with all types of personalities and people. the hardest part of job is working out in the elements of the very cold by the river. The great thing  about the job was the group of people you had to work with was great to past the long hours to go by.
good,"Operating a plant. very repetitive work. This type of work makes me feel trapped. I have very good co workers they are probably the best group of people I've ever had the opportunity to work with.The hardest part of this job is the feeling of being ""stuck"". The mos enjoyable part of this job is my coworkers."
good,"My biggest takeaway from my time at Kinder Morgan was that they simply don't value their employees very much. I will say that this seemed to vary based on department so take this review with a grain of salt. The compensation, speed of advancement, and general treatment were all very poor."
good,"At times it can be a great place to work"
good,"There's a good opportunity to work on many different things.  But the environment is extremely difficult.  There's little reward from management for doing your job well, but the blame game is guaranteed when something goes wrong."
good,"When I began, I started off making $X/hr and 120 hours/pay period. I received regular annual (COLA) raises, but made less each year (after my first year) because they continued to cut OT hours. We stayed at 105 hours/pay period for a good while, but recently they cut out OT completely to 0/pay period (with rare exceptions). Management is comfortable where they are, so there is no room for growth except over into maintenance."
good,No advancement for mid-level management yet if you do their is better opportunities if your willing to move. Assists in learning for growth for another company. It is expected that work is before family.
good,Operations is a high stress job when management micro manages every aspect of the job started out just fin but continually added processes and paperwork to the job that became redundant and overwhelming
good,"Great foot in the door work place. Learned a lot about the gas side of the industry. Work is not physically hard, but does require some common sense and mental abilities."
good,"not enough backup employees for time off difficult to use your time off"
good,"good place to work if you don't mind shift schedule, overtime and callouts. good management that wants you to succeed and won't hold you back from doing anything."
good,good pay but the higher boss have no clue as to what it takes in the field. and are to full of themselves to listen to the guy in the pit or even there lower management.
good,"good benefits"
good,Large company with strong assets.  Very aggressive culture.  Adequate compensation and benefits.  Financial challenges are dealt with swiftly.  Short term challenges but long term strength
good,KInder Morgan is a great job for financial security but it has bad management and they micromanage so much that workers feel uncomfortable.Very unorganized.
good,great job bc of benefits but no moving up unless u talk your way up and its not what u know here its who u know
good,"- Excellent learning experience"
good,"company was relocated to Calgary, management was great but changed when there were replaced "
good,"Good place to work, compensation just is not there. Great people to work with, good 401k and stocks. Depending on your position you will not get holidays and there is no sick time you have to use your vacation."
good,"Kinder Morgan appeared to be a strong company with a great goal of building a much needed piece of infrastructure for the Canadian Energy industry and other industries, but the Federal Government just can't seem to get it done. Disappointing. It's why I left."
good,It's a great job for those just starting in the fuel industry. You are the first step in the process of supplying our customers with the additive that is needed for their fuel blends.
good,"Favors for certain people and most times no advancing to other equipment, supervisors need more training. When their is down time they expect you to know what to do without telling you and their is nothing to do. Favors for certain people include easy jobs or special privileges that is not suppose to be the case. Equipment is 25/75 meaning 75 percent of the time its broken and they want you to run it unsafe and if you refuse you are put in a dirty pointless job and someone else will take the chance and risk their safety."
good,Overall a good place to work but the schedule can be undesirable and it is difficult to plan as everything can change at a moments notice. If you like variety it would be a good place.
good,Look at daily report to see to which location needed assistance. Whether it was a technical issue or process. If it was a Machanical issue assist analyst with a root cause analysis. Then report to local management and share findings with Technical manager.
good,Big and multiculture place with lots of opportunity.  Learned new systems and data analysis.  Management were very liberal and provided lot of guidelines. Great culture.
good,"The company moves at a fast pace and it is a growing company.   They move thousands of barrels of gas, oil and chemicals a day and they are buying up locations to grow."
good,i was stressful but well paid.  I feel like with better supervisors training would have gone smoother.  There is defiantly a click type of environment among workers and staff  and it can feel hostile at times.
good,"- A typical day you can  a lot of meetings"
good,KM is a good company to work for but it is hard to move around within the company without manager approval.  I learned that management is for management and not for the growth of the company.  The most enjoyable is the 9/80 schedule.
good,"Not much room for error with the Tampa Terminal. Everyone seems to walk on eggshells when Manager is out off his office and walking around. They ask for ways to protect product from contamination, but don't apply any of the advice given. You're left to fend for yourself which creates a very tense and stressful work environment. Did enjoy working with many of the people there."
good,Worked with a lot of great people at Kinder Morgan.  Upper management in Houston micro-managed.  Learned a lot during my time with them.  Was sad to see some very knowledgeable and experienced professionals ran off by micro-management.
good,Kinder Morgan is a great place to start a career.  The people I interact with on a daily basis are quality people.  The company is focused on working it's hardest for the share holders.
good,"I learned a lot in my 7 year time with KMI.  I was able to develop and move up within the company throughout the years.  The cons were very little support for upper level managers, on call 24/7."
good,"There was nothing special about this place. Typical politics that you find in any large company."
good,Over all a really good place to work with wonderful people. Really good support staff and office personal with great hour.
good,Demanding company that seems unorganized.  Good benefits and competitive pay.  Management seems disconnected from workers on the ground and only care about looking good and meeting safety requirements.
good,Just an ok place to work. Highly secure and highly regulated environment. Not very team oriented. Manager Micro Managed. Contract did not go perm as promised
good,"When I first started working at Kinder Morgan, it quickly because the best job I'd ever had.  I had a fabulous boss and outstanding co-workers.  We built the staff from 3 to 14 people at the regional office.  It was great for 4 years."
good,It was a great place to work for had great benefits but the management was not that great at what they done. the insurance was great but on the high side they expected way to much out of one person.
good,"easy to get left behind in the numbers. so many integrations, takeovers, purchases. There are good people there but it is easy to see lackadaisical attitudes."
good,"Kinder Morgan provided great opportunity for my family and I.  I was able to excel and utilize my management skills to break terminal tonnage thruput and revenue records during my tenure.  KM safety records during my tenure were well below the industry standard.  TRIR below 2.0.  "
good,"The days at Kinder Morgan as an amine plant operator are somewhat normal. I am responsible for numerous amine plants and dehydration units that are used to treat natural gas on the pipeline. The amine plant is used to remove CO2 and H2S from the natural gas, and the dehydration unit is used to remove H2O from the natural gas. I am required to keep the plants running sufficiently and properly. I am responsible for retrieving daily readings, entering the daily readings on a spreadsheet, filling out monthly forms, submitting monthly forms, inspecting pipelines for leaks and other infractions, monitoring gas flow on the pipeline to ensure I am treating the correct amount of gas, troubleshooting problems with the units I have to take care of, and resolving issues within my power after the troubleshooting has been performed. A lot goes into the mental and physical part of the job."
good,I have enjoyed my work time here so far. I am still accessing the overall job experience. Time will tell if we are perfect fit.
good,The company is still leveling out after the merger. Merger two companies with different practices takes time to work out.
good,Operation of natural gas treating equipment to maintain designated operating conditions
good,"Scheduled two crude oil pipelines. Interacted with all levels of management, field operations, pipeline control, commercial developement, accounting."
good,Getting dirty working hard. I leaned to operate heavy equipment and be a deckhand and load barges.Management was okay. My co workers were great nice people to work with. The hardest part of the job was not having a set schedule. Most enjoyable was being outside.
good,I was a temp contract programmer. A typical day was the same as any other office job. I basically work alone and had contact with the person managing the project.
good,the company has good corporate culture but does not provide much career progression options; t is mostly up the the employee to seek out internal postings
good,"Kinder Morgan is a place of many procedures and guidelines. The pay and benefits are wonderful but the place lacks the camaraderie and happiness that comes at other employers. The culture of the company gives you confidence of success but lacks the ""gel"" that you look for in a permanent career venue."
good,"KM provides subsidized parking or Metro Q-card."
good,"overall good company to work for, OT is available, most people are pretty easy to get along with. wish they would have a management team the had more knowledge of the plant itself"
good,I started work through an agency.  I worked as a scale representative and then found myself with assigned clients.  I learned a lot at this job and am thankful to have the knowledge.
good,Kinder Morgan offers plentiful opportunities and competitive compensation for engineers.  Their low frills culture is laser focused on cost control and creating distributable cash flow.
good,would have been a great place to retire from! Poor management after aquireing Highland partners. Management needs to follow through with required training by the state
good,"Kinder Morgan is a scrap metal operation located on the Tennessee River.  The company is well known in the area for its tendency to compensate workers very sufficiently for their employment.  However, the position I held, deck hand on a tug boat, was incredibly dangerous.  Therefore, I felt it in my best interest to terminate employment."
good,Company was good to work for but disappointed in how they didn't support management when the contract with the company they were managing was not renewed.
good,"I can't speak for all terminals. I've worked at the chicago terminals of kinder morgan and I can say what an experience both good and bad. Very busy steady environment and great benefits. Sometimes too many corners were cut though. Safety was sometimes compromised and only handled when things were really serious. The throughput of material was outstanding and they continue to acquire more business. Over the past few years I've seen KM hire and expedite the supervisors trainging resulting in several mistakes. This has also had an effect on Operations period. Nonetheless, you can make a great living working here and gain tons of experience while doing it."
good,"Very dependent on which business unit you're a part of- and furthermore, which department (operations, engineering commercial, EHS, etc)."
good,"The company as a whole appears solid, financially and operationally."
good,Wonderful place to work at times aside from long 12 hour days.
good,"A typical day at work includes inspecting, unloading, moving and switching Rail Cars. I learn about safety everyday. Its very important to me. Safety comes first. Management could be a little better, but overall they are easy to get along with. Co-workers are great. Everyone gets along and works well with each other. Teamwork gets the job done safely. The job isn't really hard. It can be a bit challenging at times, but thats a good thing. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that i contribute to off loading about 70% of Ethanol in California."
good,I don't recommended working for Kinder Morgan. No advancement opportunities. I don't agree with their maintenance philosophy of running equipment to failure.
good,"KM is a great place to work. Depending on what group you are in and who you report to directly, you can be extremely happy here or extremely unhappy. I was fortunate enough to work for someone who was open-minded, fair, and looked for opportunities to promote inclusion and training."
good,You are outside in the heat all day long. If you cant take working outside and you are not physically fit this job is not for you. Literally you climb tanks all day so staying hydrated and being fit are extremely important.
good,"They are willing to give all most anybody, regardless of qualification a chance to break into the oil/gas career. Some benefits seem to decline every year and rise in cost to the employee, but Their 401k and pension program is top notch."
good,Kinder Morgan had a good training program to introduce employees to the oil and gas industry. I learned a lot from their training because it was my first job in the oil field. I learned very quickly that their management training was lacking. In my experience all supervisors and management were promoted based on friendship rather than competency. After promotion there didn't seem to be any training in leadership or values as the leaders I had experience with were lacking in these areas. The pay was not adequate for the cost of living in the bakken area. Many other employers were paying significantly higher for the same job.
good,"On a normal day, I would either load or unload ships, barges, or trucks with chemicals that we stored in the storage tanks. I learned how important job safety is, since the chemicals I handled were very hazardous. The hardest part of the job was working many nights and very long hours. I say it was the hardest part, but it was also good money and I will work as much as I can to help support myself."
good,"a typical day at work will be greetings customers and make sure"
good,You will be asked to work extremely long hours so be ready for sacrifice.My own experience is I was faced with the worst of the worst when it comes to corporate yes men who spent more time covering for each other than productive management. Worse yet they are controlled by a team of reactionary Directors who manage solely from a place of fear. A healthy work environment is extremely important anywhere.
good,Prejudice  when I comes to placing blame on lower echelon employees.  No one in upper mgt. wants to take responsibility for mistakes made.  Always placed on employees.  Mgt. is no qualified to do the jobs they are assigned.  The Peter Principle is eating this company up.
good,"Kinder Morgan has a professional environment. I learned some solid financial practices.  I was fortunate to be under the tutelage of their Treasury Management Team, which provided sound mentoring and support."
good,A typical day at Kinder Morgan consists of unloading Ethanol Rail cars to tanks then pipe lined to several refineries. My favorite part of my job is meeting new people and working as a team.  The hardest part right now is learning to run the locomotive to switch Rail cars since we now have to learn that aspect of the job.
good,"a routine day will be to review the daily email , look for updates on deferent projects and issues reported by operations, prioritize the issues and communicate to others via email or person to person."
good,"Good, overall. If you are patient to stay at it, and keep working at the challenges that the workers pose, you may be well on your way to beating their  intrigue and the little or no cooperation you might get due to very poor reasons."
good,this place was good for giving you weekends off. they don't pay to bad and you got plenty of breaks throughout the day. they have policies in places that if it was unsafe you could stop and seek assistance
good,"operations work such as:"
good,"Pipeline Controller / Scheduler Sr. II."
good,Hard labor. It was a great experience learning about the different types of metals and working on different trucks. I enjoyed working with a variety of people. The managers were very supportive
good,"My Terminal with employees I manage is a great place to work, the corporate politics tend to hinder the business. Safety is number one priority, however egos tend to hinder progress for a solution to resolve an issue."
good,"Upper management keeps lower management (supervisors,) stressed and creates confusion. It seemed like at times upper management wanted chaos happening. If you have a problem keep it to your self, most questions, concerns are met with quick responses that usually are followed up with extreme non professionalism. If you want to be thrown to the dogs and sink or swim become a field operator. You'll either make it or not.. But if you make it through the BS you'll have a fantastic skill set to build off of."
good,"A typical day at work was starting off with a safety meeting. Then paperwork on inspecting overhead crane. Then writing a job hazard analysis on the work to be done. Then stopping to help anybody that needed equipment to be repaired. Then you are able to start back on your own work until something else comes up."
good,They are a pretty good company. I wish it was closer to home. I enjoy working with the people. I would work for them again. If I had the chance I would work directly for them.
good,Management needs work. Solid policies and procedures. Hourly employees always willing to assist and help with day to day tasks. Need better communications between managers and hourly employees
good,"The company is well established, but work life balance is not very good. "
good,"Enjoyed working at Kinder Morgan and the most of the people that I worked with at Kinder Morgan."
good,"I had just moved to Texas, found this job position working on "
good,"High pressure job, good pay and benefits. The main problem is the work schedule rotation Good people to work with and very team oriented.A lot of the work is outside in all weather conditions."
good,"Start of my shift (1400-2200) i write down all the plant operating orders (poo) and then i go check out the entire field to see where all the pipelines are relieving. As i do my relief check i will switch where lines are relieving depending on the non going orders i have to set up. "
good,"Contract work, I worked with client, really no contact with CESG other than submitting time sheets. Only contact was when time sheets were due."
good,Overall good place to work the bulk terminals do not get the attention or funding the large liquid terminals do. Most of Kinder Morgan's business is transporting and storage of liquid commodities.
good,"It is a great job to work, the best thing is you work a lot of overtime. The guys are all friendly and speak to you with a respectful way. It is no more than 2 working in the office. As time progress, you will work by yourself."
good,"There is not a lot of turnover and advancement takes a long time. The management is good, but still finding its way with the high pace of growth. The culture is a mix of several companies that varies with the area of work."
good,The crews were fantastic but there was no time off we worked 24/7 and if you were not working you were on-call. The crews did not complain because they were making a lot of overtime. We ran lean but always got the job done. I was able to hire a few extra operators to give a set schedule so that people could have some time off.
good,Work consists of coming in early to prep for the day.  Scheduling jobs and working with my subordinates to accomplish daily tasks while continuing to assist any last minute items.
good,"The group of workers were good, good equipment, good maintanace department, good saftey record ,to many managers watching and fighting over the same jobs causing a lot of loss in production, the higher up bosses needed to do a better job asigning managers to each task and keeping them seperate ,good clean lunch room and locker room ,big turn over in workers due to the constant change of work in the industry would work a month straight 12 hrs a day then cut back to 40hrs a week or laid off."
good,I operate our gas compressor station. I make rounds throughout the facility to ensure everything is in proper working order. I have learn many things as an operator.
good,A typical day at work would generally consist of monitoring the pipelines and keeping them in a steady state. Interpreting the schedules to meet the customer's needs was probably the most important thing I learned and will help me in the future. I really enjoyed together as a team with my co-workers and we all got along quite well.
good,"workplace culture could use improvement "
good,"Once you start your day (as an electrical technician) it is very hard to get the opportunity to be done for the day before midnight due to call-outs. I couldn’t say enough about the other technicians though, always very supportive. The management wasn’t bad either with one exception: they will hold a mistake against you even though they promise they won’t. Good luck!"
good,Good place to work. Great benefits and the highest paid hourly job in the area.  Overtime is present and PTO and sick days are lumped into one total package of time off.
good,The company requires a lot out of their management.  They have a highly lean staff and could use additional higher level positions to assist in the workload.
good,"At my terminal, you have to stay on top of every aspect of your job. Take the opportunities to get extra work done when you have it and always have a sign of urgency. Stay focused and be ready to change plans through out the day."
good,The workplace culture is business casual.  The people in different departments are very friendly.  A high priority is placed on engineers.  The upper management talk to us once a year and let us know how the company is doing.
good,"Very Repetitious job. "
good,Great company until the aquasition of El Paso Pipeline. I was working at the Eagle Ford Shell as an Inspector.  I would not get home until 9 or 10 at night for close to 4 years. Even after appealing to management for more help it fell on deaf ears. It cost me a marriage.
good,when I was there the over time wasn't there.the enconomy was getting bad so the over time wasn't there.but its a good company to work for and the people there is like family
good,"Beware beware..."
good,Overall Kinder Morgan is a great place to work with great benefits. If you get on a good crew your work experience will be that much better. I would recommend Kinder Morgan as a career move.
good,"While Kinder Morgan is a fantastic company to work for with great pay and great benefits and good employee incentives in the way of bonuses there also draw backs.  My work as a measurement technician was enjoyable, fairly easy, and diverse enough to keep the job from becoming stagnant or a drain.  The people you work with are great and helpful. The management at the location I worked at was not good.  They would play favorites and treat people differently depending on how they liked them.  While this may happen everywhere this particular management would single out individuals and treat them poorly in front of other employees to create a hostile work environment."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. The headquarters located in Houston is a beautiful building and the executives are easily accessible and visible during business hours.
good,"A good place to work with little experience and learn a lot along the way. Another twelve hour shift work kind of job. A lot of hours to be made at this company. Overtime, holidays and weekends."
good,load an unload trucks work with others to keep up warehouse work in a timely manner to keep up production pick an stage orders drive forklift to move product around warehouse
good,"I enjoyed working at Kinder Morgan as a Compliance Paralegal. Kinder Morgan was under a Debarment Agreement that it would report environmental leaks to the EPA and NRC within ten days of the incident. I tracked these events and instructed employees how to report incidents. I learned a lot about the oil industry. I enjoyed tracking the incidents, setting up the database and working with people. I was there for seven months."
good,"Overall, Kinder Morgan is a stable company for which to work. Given their business model, they do not have issues with layoffs. They recognize and reward talented employees."
good,"Night shift, good experience doing many different job types, long work week, good pay and benefits. Paid holidays and 2 weeks vacation to start with."
good,Kinder Morgan is a great company to work for. I enjoyed my time and Kinder Morgan was more than a job it was like a family. A typical 12 hour shift consisted of cutting grass and monitoring pipelines.
good,Work yourself to death straight thru the shift. If vessels werent there to recieve product we had an easy day
good,"Good place to work, management does not have the knowledge to run the company."
good,Good place to work - very demanding pace but satisfying.  Must be prepared to work long hours and weekends in a Safe and Environmentally Compliant manner.  Safety is of the utmost importance.
good,"Extreme focus on financial performance, top heavy and no resemblance of a training program.  Very fast moving nimble company and good ideas get fast tracked."
good,"-A typical day at work was boxing document to be shipped and putting the documents on excel spreadsheet. Shipped over 600 boxes it destination. "
good,"ran conveyers, set rail cars, general laborer working out doors in all weather nice co-workers"
good,Too many employees for the amount of work .  Spent most of the time trying to find projects to work on.
good,"Typical 8 - 10 hour work day, Monday thru Friday."
good,"verify invoices, coding, signiture and AFE"
good,"Solid company that rapidly went down hill after Rich Kinder retired from running the company. Meet some very good professionals there and they were very good at compensation staff, and management. However they lacked the vision to become a global leader and remained just a ""pipeline"" company. Work facilities were above the average."
good,OK just be flexible. I would say that if you are willing to learn and commit the time to it you could make a career out of a good starting position and they tend to have jobs all over the US.
good,"Good place to work, great work environment. Daily grind is easily adjusted to Company really strict on Safety, and Compliance. Pay scale seems to be on the high end to my Knowledge."
good,There is always a lot going on and a lot of interdependence on other departments for your goals to be met.  The company is filled with great people who love what they do.
good,tons of overtime if you want it. you write your own pay check! management and training suck so you have to get out in the field and learn with your crew.
good,"Kinder Morgan is a company that is very focused on the shareholder and as a result tends to forget about the employee. The culture leans a bit conservative and also older. Most people do not want to leave their positions, which makes it harder for younger talent to move up."
good,"There is no typical day.  You may plan on accomplishing certain things, but something else always comes up and is time consuming.  Management places too much work on a ""desk"" expecting everything to get done, but does not realize how time consuming some projects are."
good,"Interesting place to work, but upper management seemed very disorganized. They put me in a position where I was out by myself and handed a field to run on my own. I was able to accomplish the jobs tasks but with very little help from other KM employees or managers. I had to build all finacial and safety programs by myself from scratch."
good,The work was not too challenging. There is mostly hands on training and alot of self supervision. There were not many surprises and relatively low stress.
good,Other than low pay and swing shifts very good place to work..
good,Full of surprises but good ones. This job required you to learn everyday. Do your job propely they stay off you. Each shift basically got along with each other. Making sure you do your job right wrong could cost your job. They payed double and triple time for holidays.
good,"Offload vessels, move railcars, load/offload railcars, tranfer products."
good,"As a field engineering intern, Kinder Morgan makes a huge effort to expose students to as much of the pipeline operations as possible by having interns rotate along with operators to learn what their day to day tasks are. "
good,Needs better training . Overall the work and the people there is good people to build a career around. It’s a good place to go before you really pursue a long term job
good,"A very challenging but rewarding business.  The management team from top to bottom is very supportive.  A business that provides opportunities to employees in a variety of disciplines (corrosion, damage prevention, automation, operations, etc.)"
good,Change into your uniform check go to your to the meeting of the day after check your forklift  get your paper of the thing you need to do and start pulling your ordes
good,"Great place to work, not much room for advancement in field locations as people tend to stay.  Corporate locations have plenty of opportunity for growth. - Very competitive."
good,Great company to work for and excellent benefits. Pay is mid level for oil and gas industry. Some room for advancement. Bonuses and pay raises are standard
good,"KMI is a lean and efficient organization.  They are a large company that is still, refreshingly, run like a small organization.  Executive management is very hands on and involved in the day to day operations of the company."
good,Decent workplace as well as decent work. The hardest part of the job would be unloading and loading welding truck before and after each job. The most enjoyable part about the job is the traveling to different states and towns.
good,A lot of skilled employees that are dedicated to their job. Job required a lot of time in the field in all types of weather. Overall a good place to work
good,I liked the company but the advancement opportunities were limited as well as pay increases based on performance. The company as a whole is stable and they offer good benifits
good,"The hardest part of the job was cleaning the Executive Floors as they had pretty high expectations, and it required a lot of time. However for most other duties, it is pretty manageable and you work in pairs which makes it easier."
good,Kinder Morgan Energy Partners was an interesting place to work. For many years it was very cool and everyone worked well together like a family.
good,A different type of energy company.  From an engineering point of view this company is different.  The run more from the business side rather than the engineering side.
good,Kinder Morgan was a good company to work for a typical day was focus on the liquids pipeline operations.  Making sure schedules were followed.  When I left we had mostly new inexperienced pipeline controllers.  The operations group was a good group and I enjoyed working with them.
good,Kinder Morgan is a solid working environment. The benefits and compensation are equal to most oil production and pipeline transportation companies. Organization and job security are good with technology advancement more paced.
good,"Kinder Morgan has one of the best Benefit packages I have seen for companies in this area.  No problem getting overtime, sometimes more overtime than you want.  The team of employees at Kinder Morgan all work very well with each other.  There is definitely a Team Atmosphere, where everyone looks out for each other and works with each other."
good,no real outside life if you working for this company as an operator
good,"we work rain,sleet,and snow loading & unloading material on & of rail cars,trucks,and barges using numerous types of equipment"
good,my day starts off with a safety/quality talk with my crew. i learned that safety should come first above all when it comes to working in that kind of environment. management is always on you and it was uncomfortable to work. that was also the hardest part of the job. the most enjoyable part of the job was when we can work in peace without management on our back. my former coworkers were friendly and always helpful.
good,Cool somewhat laidback place to work. Management is kinda clueless of what’s going on. No real goals of achievement. Kind of a free for all on the daily activities.
good,Typical for HR to side with business than employee. Mgmt is not consistent within the company. If you have a good manager you will love your job.  Managers throw their reports under the bus.
good,"stressful it can be, l learned that loading ethanol you must be very careful loading by the book and safety. management was pretty good.the hardest part was making sure all the loads came out on time.learning about ethanol."
good,"Highly supportive environment. "
good,"Fast paced and days go quick."
good,Kinder Morgan is a large enough firm to support employees through fair wages and good benefits.  The stability of the company and room to advance within is why I would recommend Kinder Morgan to a friend or family member.
good,"Great people to work with. Highly dedicated to the company because the company is highly dedicated to the employee. "
good,"depending on what pipeline do you get, it can be super busy and stressful. Making you feel other co-workers have it easy, or easier. The pay is reasonable, great pay for not being required to have a degree. It is shift work."
good,"Management will work with you if they can.  Benefits are okay.  Over all its the workers that make the workplace good.  12 hour work days, you have to like your coworkers"
good,Wonderful place to work with a good mix of employees.  Enjoy going to work and interacting with our clients.  Exciting to know that our job of moving petroleum products from refinery to the gas station benefits all Americans with a motor vehicle.
good,"Challenging and demanding atmosphere, from which great satisfaction is derived from work well done.  Great team environment, with adequate and supportive management core"
good,Hard work but great pay. Just not a lot of family time. Typical day is pre-work safety meeting. Then taking calls and conducting equipment pm's. Like any other job can be stressful at times.
good,"Working for Kinder Morgan is hard work, it is a very active and fast pace workplace.  It has given me the experience I need to further my career in the chemical industry."
good,A typical day of work is very fast paced with minimal down time.  As a Sr. Dispatcher there are high standards that are constantly changing and must be followed.  The best part of working at Kinder Morgan is the fact that they give training on a regular basis to keep all employees up to date.
good,"I was always busy with different tasks.  Between spreadsheets, manual labor, and handling day to day tasks, I always had something to do.  It is a safety oriented company which made me more safe in my every day life."
good,"Kinder Morgan, Inc was a good place to work. The salary was very good. A typical day was fast paced and very little down time. I learned how to forecast financials and do yearly budgets on multi-million dollar pipelines. It was a high profile job where you dealt with the President and Vice Presidents daily. The hardest part was working budget process through the last 6 months of the year along with all your regular daily work. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the Account Directors(Marketers) and the shipper's on the pipelines."
good,I kept machines running. I performed any that was mechanically required. My co-workers were easy to work with. the hardest part was getting started. The easiest part was working with others.
good,This was a great introductory to telemarketing inbound calling. The supervisor were very fair and easy to work with.
good,"Monthly safety training and daily training. Lots on driving and older machines, pipeline are safe and maintained, great group of guys to work with. Pay is good for the area."
good,"I've been here since 2006 and I've seen a lot of people come and go. You've got to put in time and you'll reap the rewards. In the end you can always make up money, but you cant make up time."
good,"I worked for both division's and enjoyed working with all sites,  I supported 39 sites from the east coast Philadelphia to Tampa  and west to Texas, AR, IL, MS, KY, TN, Al and La,  biggest drawback was time away from family, on the road every week.  I learned a vast amount of information I.e pipeline ops, rail, slag plant, Tugs, barges, Tank farms, coal terminals as well steel mill ops"
good,Arrive to work at scale house and then proceed to Gate 10 to foreman office to receive paperwork for trucks that will arrive thrr out the day. when truck arrives at scale house weight truck in ask for pickup number or unload number washout ticket and strapping chart. then find paperwork for that load and once found complete documents and then send truck to location to get check in with foreman or supervisor on duty. once driver is loaded or unloaded will report back to scale house and receive bol and scale tickets and any paperwork that have to leave with driver. example if hazmat needs placards and all ldocuments
good,I enjoy interacting with customers and truck drivers daily while I solve problems with billing.  I've learned a lot about the gas industry while working at a terminal seeing everything first hand rather than seeing it on a film or picture.  the most enjoyable part of my job is working with others who work in a team environment.
good,Most management tries to talk to you any kind of way and try to make you feel like your not a grown person. They tell you one thing in the safety meeting but when your in the field they just want you to get the job done. They say safety is not compromised but if they need the numbers met they will make you work extra everyday and don’t care if your tired.
good,"KMI has been a great experience for me. My skills have grown while employed at KMI. This company focuses on taking care of its employees financially rather than ""perks"" which can be a good thing."
good,"The workplace atmosphere is friendly, workload is manageable.  Walking distance from 2 LRT platforms DT Calgary."
good,over all a good work place. depending on department you work in its a good place to work. Orange Ca. Controllers shutting down in 2019. Moving to Houston Texas. Trans mix dept. in California may be done in April of 2019 division. unknown day to day now. uncertain future...
good,"The work itself is not difficult, but it is repetitive. Typical work cycle would be: 1st week of the month you are busy with deadlines, 2nd & 3rd weeks you are refreshing your work templates and updating data, and the 4th week of the month you are meeting with your project managers and updating forecasts."
good,This position was extremely fast paced. There was no time for breaks and you were constantly busy. Training is imperative for success in this position.
good,Kinder Morgan is a great company to work for. There is plenty of room for advancement for employees that work hard. The only negative would be the difference in business units makes it feel like a separate company
good,"good to work at KM, great employees, very helpful, good management, steady work, travel is required, benefits are great, stock share, 9/80, holidays, flex hours"
good,"Great and constructive learning experience. Different activities within the scope of work, good combination between finances and management. Hardly any time idle."
good,it was a fun place to work. But a hazardous work environment. I enjoyed my time with this company. Training was top of the line and they had very competitive wages.
good,Great workers and supervisors.  Really care for each other. They also help you even if you don't need it. They care about your family.
good,"The pay is decent, but the jobs are generally under staffed and they "
good,"Fast paced environment that required attention to detail, accuracy, and ability to multi-task. Worked with various departments both in office and in the field."
good,Kinder Morgan strives to be the best with the safety culture in all aspects and operations involved.  The company has put in to practice of allowing employees to stop a process/operation/job if a safety or operation concern arises without any repercussions from management.  This type of structure has allowed the company to earn respect from employees due to putting them before the company.
good,"As a mover of product from rail to road Kinder Morgan focuses on safety. Many hours are dedicated to training and certification. The work itself is not difficult once learned. There is a lot of lifting, walking, and climbing (on rail cars), but physical exercise is a benefit to sitting all day. Outside work in all types of weather is required, also."
good,Kinder is company with good benefits and and good work environment. I enjoy working with my coworkers. I would like to see more team building activities from upper management.
good,"good place to work, good culture and people. Company provides good benefits as well as competitive pay. Highly recommend this company"

good,"Co-workers were good to get along with.  I learned how to operate an overhead bridge crane. The hardest part f my job was being away from my family due tot he shift work, but I will always do what is necessary for my family."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed assisting our pipeline customers each day and coordinating the annual customer meeting. The most difficult part of my job was reconciling the pipeline each month and not necessarily the most difficult, but the most tedious was the weekly and monthly government reporting. All of my co-workers were friendly and helpful."

good,"•	Full charge processing of all training for the Source & Transportation (S and T) North and South"
good,"I would get every operator situated on what there task is going on for the day. From what is going on in the refinery with the crane, how many cars we have to unload, to loading a bulk ship and getting paperwork started or closing on a ship. Nightshift consist of same operations, but align switches and prepare to receive inbound train for the next day. I got along well with employees and management throughout terminal and other facilities. I enjoyed coming in to work there was always something new to experience and learn from in the oil/gas industry."
good,"Kinder Morgan is a great company to work for.  And the upper management is great and very good with there employees. "
good,The division I worked at has been sold off to another managing company.  It seamed that filled most of the management and technician positions with the least qualified worst trained people just before they sold the place off. Taking the good guys with them.
good,"Kinder Morgan is a large company and has many things and projects going but still takes time to speak with its team in or out of the field and works close with 3nd party inspections to insure the projects are completed safely and on time and under budget, so over all they are one of the best to work for in this industry."
good,"line up conveyour belts "
good,"	Manage shipper imbalances, reconcile pipeline interconnect balances, managed daily customer calls and assisted with any discrepancies."
good,"Kinder Morgan was a fantastic place to work especially if you enjoying a fast paced, challenging, dynamic work environment. The growth ability is great if you a near one of their HQs, the pay is excellent as well as the benefits, and it is a very stable corporation who is always valuating its business mix and asset base."
good,It's an exciting time to be at Kinder Morgan. Very focused management team with clear vision for the future.
good,"A typical day at work involved working with schedulers, traders, pipeline accountants and various departments, making sure prices and volumes was correct before sending out invoices and confirming before settlement date (most of these were netting customers). Resolve and clear up A/R and A/P accruals on a daily basis; heavily involved with customers and management in order to achieve maximum porfitability. Had a very good relationship with co-workers."
good,Highly professional company. Very cooperative co-workers. Enjoyable working climate. Good place to work. Good benefits while working and also upon separation.
good,Punching in five minute safety meeting and overall work load. Transferring bulk materials anything from liquid to plastics some hazardous materials were involved from rail cars to semi trucks and vice verse.Basic yard maintenance and training of new employees. The hardest part of the job in my opinion was making sure the material was heated to proper temperature before moved into other locations.  The part i enjoyed the most was learning new things about the stuff we were loading and unloading and meeting new people.

good,"Worked there for seven years and thought it was a great place to work. Thought it would be the place I retired from. However, my position was eliminated with the Kinder Morgan purchase of El Paso Pipelines."
good,"This used to be a great place to work. Good pay, great coworkers. But now they are selling us off to buy another company, so we are thrown to the wolves. Who knows when or to whom we will be sold, or split up and sold off piecemeal. Right now, no future here if you are tied to kmigt, rex, or trail blazer in any manor."
good,I love this place and some of the people I get the honor to work with. But I will say the corporate structure and higher management are total money only priority. I want to say that their worried about their stock price but I need to emphasize this they worry about it enough to let employees go for any reason they can come up with. Hr isn't their to help the employee he is only their to  to help kinder Morgan screw the employee legally.

good,I worked 16 years for this company and I had a great experience with my co-workers and management team. I had the opportunity to grow and develop skills.
good,"Working as a 3rd-party inspector for Kinder Morgan was a good opportunity to work directly for a company and learn their way of doing business.  All while watching out for their best interests as a contractor representative.  It proved challenging at times, but overall was a seamless, good length of employment.  Made several long-term relationships and would gladly work for them again."

good,Learned a lot had some very strong help. Great opportunities to learn. Great company to work for! I was able to learn at my own pace. I only left because of personal family issues!
good,I operated several types of equipment and had to be aware of my surroundings at all times. I would be placed inside a ship on a piece of equipment  to move fertilizer to the center of the ship for a crane to pick up. I also moved fertilizer in and around the warehouse. Safety is always top priority for myself and others.

good,Great company to work for.  Great co-workers.  Good management.  Great balance job work/ life balance.  I loved the work we did and i personally love working on the lake.
good,a typical day at kinder morgan would be hauling from the port to yard. I learned what work safety is and the best co-workers i have ever had. Hardest part of the job was actually learning to operate a crane.
good,"Easily accessed, Can offer substantial experience. Managed others. Eye for details."
good,"Advancement opportunity is next to zero. Swing shift, 12.5 hour days but with multiple days off. Actually zero work/life balance."
good,"This job allowed me to learn more than the average"

good,"Safety is the first consideration with every task and job no matter what or how long it takes. The job must he evaluated, the procedures reviewed, a JHA developed and discussed and all conditions inspected. Should anything change the teammate must STOP. STOP is not as suggestion but a condition of continued employment and no one is ever disciplined for calling a YOU CAN STOP"
good,Wonderful place to work for with very descent mangar and friendly staff. I've worked there for almost 7 months and I am hoping to get a chance to work there again.

good,"the company was good and had excellent benefits, the people worked good together and you always had what you needed to do the job.  The company would work with family emergencies too"
good,"I normally work from 6 pm to 6 am daily and work overtime as needed by the company. As listed on my resume I have been formally trained to repair and operate all types of heavy machinery. I work along side the operators maintaining, fueling, troubleshooting, and performing all necessary repairs to all heavy machinery. The hardest part of the job is performing repairs in all weather. I enjoy the independence of being self supervised and am will very capable working in a team enviroment."
good,"Daily receipt of vessels into the terminal. Busy truck rack loading facilities with over 100 trucks a day."
good,I have enjoyed my tenure at Kinder Morgan for 13 years. I would surely continue working for this company if there were alternative jobs available in this region.

good,"At this job, I did many different menial landscaping tasks including gardening, painting, tree trimming, and more.  This job requires me to do a lot of things that I had zero experience in, and, as a result, I learned to perform tasks out of my comfort zone in a way that was satisfactory to my bosses. I was also able to practice time management, which is an area I really think I developed in. The management was easy to work with, but as I was a summer worker, I didn't deal with the management that much. I really only dealt with the company's management when they had to give me new assignments. The hardest part of the job was learning to perform new tasks in a satisfactory manner. The culture of the job was much more blue collar than I was used to."

This research also extends to organizing speaking engagements for the public affairs team in the local area."
good,"No two days were the same. I definitely had the pleasure of learning more about document management and site management for each of the terminals I prepared and stored site drawings from a design standpoint. I coordinated with external engineering companies that performed the design/construction for the KM terminals and stations. The management is very professional is always willing to work with their employees and teach when able to do so. My co-workers are great to work with as well. Teamwork is essential in this position, so it's imperative to form solid working relationships in that roll. The toughest part of the job, was obtaining completed drawings/work packages from the companies performing work on the sites. The technical aspect of the job was always a learning process as well. I very much enjoyed working with the other internal groups to help complete projects that were in the process of development, design or construction."

The hardest part of the job was getting all of the work done and not having anything to do to keep yourself busy while the time went by. The co-workers were fun to be around, cared a lot about our safety and were there to answer any question that I had to ask. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work that I did do because it made the time go by faster. I learned how to use a fire extinguisher the right way and the PASS method (Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep). Lastly, I learned how to use a crane to pick up coils and load them onto trucks, that was the best part of the job to me."
good,"I enjoyed eight months here through a contract obligation.  It was a very demanding role, requiring me to quickly learn their methodology and processes.  I was also given the task of consolidating the annual plan and verifying the data as it was presented to senior management."

good,I was contracted to work for them trough an inspection company (June 2013 to November 2013). It was by far the best work experience of my life. Management was extremely kind and understanding. They trained me well and were the most reasonable individuals I have ever had the privilege and honor of working with.  Coworkers would often meet after work and were very direct and polite about any issues or concerns that came up. However like all good things the projects came to an end.
good,This was a great experience. Everyone I worked with was helpful and great to work with. I was treated with the most respect being I was the only woman on this job.

Meet the Mexican gas transportation laws together with the Kinder Morgan specifications. Direct contact with suppliers."
good,"A typical day at the field office starts at 6 am.  I am there to gather reports from the inspectors from their previous work day and begin compiling the Chief Inspector Daily Report.  During the day I am given the packing slips for the materials that arrived.  After verifying the materials did arrive I send a copy of the packing slips to the main office so that payment processing on the material can take place.  I put the materials received on the Bill of Materials and if it is pipe, I also add to the Pipe Tally.  These are crucial closeout documents that tie all the material together so that auditors can see that the pipeline is complying with industry and government standards.  This is also a way to explain the costs involved.  I enjoy working, traveling and meeting new people. I have learned a lot and although I know I've still got a lot to learn, I am eager and up for the challenge. I have never worked with a group of people that I did not like or could not get along with.  These people are like me, trying to make a living.  The hardest part of my job is pulling out of the driveway leaving home going to the job, and the second hardest part is at the end where I'm parting company never knowing whether I will ever see these people again.  It's all good."

I have learned how to run equipment and work with coal.I had a couple different managers as my first one retired but both would not hesitate to let me learn a new piece of equipment. I have had may shift changes so never worked with many to long being that they tried to cut back to less employees but i have to say i enjoyed all i worked with.The hardest part was swing shift for my family but i got used to it and it became normal. The most enjoyable for me was learning how to run the equipment i have always want to run a dozer and loader so that was fun for me to learn
good,"Shift change is at 5 o clock. Dock workers discuss what happened during there shift and what needs to be down. I learned how to load and unload vessels, barges, tank cars, and railcars. Management is good. Hardest part was climbing shore tanks during inventory time and gauging each one."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Kinder Morgan Altamont.  The people working there are the salt of the Earth.  I will miss the people the most.  The work was always a good challenge but rewarding, knowing that you are helping to provide the world with energy to heat their homes and power their lives.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers and their great attitudes.  The most challenging part of the job as a Right of Way Agent was dealing with upset landowners, but to me that was always a challenge to overcome objections and rewarding in the end, because it was what I was good at.  The office building itself was a little lacking but the people made up for it.  I didn't expect the Hilton though, it is Altamont Utah after all."
good,"Achieved complete knowledge of account payable, "
