rating,review
good,"There expectations of their employees was unrealistic. Large task load , no other staff to help. The pharmacy manager I began with was great but lazy. The next who took over was extremely unstable and grew angry easily with technicians."
good,Tend to get lost in the large amout of employees and overlooked as well as the customer service for clients. Pay is low for the amout of time and hard work an employee puts in.
good,"I quit this job several months after working there. I was promised a position at the Panama city Beach location after training in Destin, FL. However, they didn't keep this promise and I didn't want to drive an hour to and from work everyday with the minimal pay I was receiving."
good,12 hours work days in they will firer you for being 1min later not good for people that have family also management there need to be change really bad management
good,"As for my store, it was a completely unprofessional work environment, and very negative when not in front of the customers."
good,"Great experiences, good co workers. Customers will never understand that the employees do no set the prescription prices. overall good experience"
good,"my first healthcare related paid compensation. manager was two-faced by the employees were great. scheduling could've been better. must be on time, co-worker were nice."
good,"This is a typical company that struggles in treating their employees fairly. The pay is adequate for the line of work. Recently bought out by CVS, unsure of what changes will be made."
good,My co-workers and immediate supervisors are amazing but the corporate supervisors do not care about the little people. I have enjoyed working with patients everyday and being able to help people. The hardest part is when you can't help someone and you know they need something. The pay at CVS is not competitive but it's the people that have kept me there.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at CVS pharmacy. The hardest part for me was the fast paced flow, but once you learn how the process works, its really a wonderful experience."
good,I enjoyed working at omincare but it was only a temp job I would of like to stay there I was made a team lead in the short amount of time I was there
good,"Not a bad job for a little while. Unless you are lucky it is hard to move up manly because someone has to move out."
good,"Working at a long-term care pharmacy was totally different than working at a retail pharmacy. Meaning, the laws, rules, and guidelines are a lot different. The most enjoyable part of my day was knowing I made a patient happy by getting their medications paid for and shipped out within a timely fashion."
good,Very little compassion with outside affairs such as family issues therefore no leniency on schedules.  No structured training or enforcement on rules
good,"This job is a good ""Starter Job"" for the younger crowd.  The hours were the hardest to deal with as far as the late hours.  The environment was overall enjoyable to work in."
good,"fun work place with supportive management, decent amount of pay, good place to work at if you like retail, friendly environment, etc"
good,"Fun place to work part time if you're in high school or something. People were friendly, but it can at some points be stressful."
good,There was always something to do good and bad. Always a mess. can never finish anything. some of the employees are rude to you. you will have to stay longer then your scheduled. sometimes short handed. But the best part of the days is when you go home to your family and rest with them
good,Worked setting fixtures merchandise and visual aids. To the standards set fort by the coporate plan. Be it in a new building or current store.
good,"Omnicare provided good work experience in different aspects of healthcare administration and billing. The supervisors are kind and helpful, and it is good for someone trying to break into the healthcare industry and desiring pharmacy knowledge and experience."
good,It's a good starting place to work at especially when you need overnight hours. Would recommend it for college students that needs a flexible schedule.
good,worked there when the first open it nice clean and they seemed to care about who they hired. The training class was long but yet very helpful. I am now in the medical field and what I learned here helped me to understand a little more when it comes to benefits and terminology.
good,"Work with excellent co-workers, but do not have enough people to properly run the business due to Company staffing cuts."
good,"I would organize the items in the store, answer phone calls for the store and dealt with customers who had complaints. I would help out in the back and face items so it would be better for the customer to see and help with advertisements."
good,The company's initiatives towards health and well being for customers is very good. Focus on how to assist customers is helpful
good,"I worked here for about 3.5 years, doing everything from the register to photo to pharmacy. I spent a majority of my time in the pharmacy. My particular store was good and I thoroughly enjoyed working there. I do wish corporate was a little more giving to it's employees. I needed to be a RPhT in order to keep my job, and the license needs to be renewed every other year with a $75 fee that CVS does not reimburse. I wanted to become a CPhT but they do not cover the almost $200 test. There was little opportunity for advancement. Luckily my managers and co-workers were great and made my experience there as good as I could have hoped for."
good,"I absolutely love the work I'm doing. Is it busy? Yes. Are their difficult situations? Yes. I love this job because it keeps you busy. Between dealing with customers, filling medications, or working on inputting scripts, there is always something to be done. The people I work with are great too. "
good,Patients call in to order medications for mail delivery.  Handled 50 to 70 calls a day.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with patients that call in yelling or upset about not being able to order medication.
good,People were very nice I did get along with all the co-workers. I learned how to complete a task to get work done on time. Management was great they always told you when you did a great job.
good,its a decent place to work.  no hours though.  turn over rate for employees are very high.  although i don't understand why they keep hiring and rehiring.
good,"It might be due to it being my second job  in my work-life, but it was mostly dull though easy. It did wear on me a bit."
good,It is a great way to keep the your bio major and do something related. I learn how to interact with patients and helping them. I became familiar to the drugs that are behind the counter and educated on real life experience. The pay was not that great but it is my first career job out of my college.
good,"Great place to work but you dont have a set schedule, you basically have to suck up to whoever makes the schedules in order for you to get hours (if you're part time). Pay is ok but sucks when compared to others in the same field."
good,"The job itself is great, challenging, but not difficult. There are no bonuses or incentives though and for the hard workers who do more than they are required to do and work overtime to help the team there are no extras for.  They are also not very understanding with their attendance policy."
good,"Azienda a gestione familiare con dinamiche interne ed esterne non sempre facili da seguire."
good,"Typical day would be eight seven hours of checking faxed rx scripts for urgency. had to do at least 80 rx a day with no errors. Some co-workers where okay, some kept up drama so I stayed away from them. Management was okay, easy to talk to talk to and worked with me when I had a family emergency. Hardest part of my job was not being able to move around. sitting steal causes drowsiness, the most enjoyable part was meeting new people and a different type of job experience."
good,The training that I was supposed to have never happened and I was never put in the position I was assigned. They made me feel out of place and no one was willing to guide me.
good,Overall Cvs is a ok company.  It's a headache because stores are understaffed. They require a lot without giving you the hours to do it.
good,"Busy,non stop. High volume location. Learn new medications almost everyday, constantly working on typing skills, the hardest part of the job is trying to make every customer happy. Most enjoyable part is the staff. We all get along well and enjoy trying to just keep each other lifted."
good,"I worked at CVS Pharmacy for about 4 years. Because I am a hard-worker and devoted to any task I take up, I was able to hand the work with no issues. I always left work satisfied that I did the most I could for my patients."
good,I enjoyed my tenure with CVS Health and appreciated the opportunity to assist participants in utilizing their prescription benefits.
good,"Working here was very nice, all my co-workers were friendly and i learned a lot on the job.At times the pharmacy could be hectic however, we worked together to get the tasks done."
good,"I have been with this company for 4 years and only receive a 25 cent raise each year if that. We do a lot of stocking and planograms and as well as cashiering. I just recently transferred and I like this location a lot better as well as the manager and other co-workers. I think the hardest part is dealing with difficult customers and not having more employees per shift. The most enjoyable part is being able to interact and meet so many new people every day. On the contrary, I do feel as though CVS employees are over worked and under paid."
good,This was a temporary assignment until I could find permanent work.  I can not say one way or another whether it was a positive or negative experience because I was not there long enough.
good,"good customer service, not much movement allowed in company"
good,"too much work in too little time"
good,High volume working environment with opportunity for growth. Must be flexible and ready to adjust to the business needs.
good,Very fast work environment with great co-workers. Managment is very good at communicating any company wide information with the employees.
good,It is a very nice place to work and getting to know the customer dislike and likes with in the community. The co workers was very nice and friendly to work with.
good,Friendly environment with knowledgeable pharmacists and interns. They have unrealistic standards. According to some policies. Overall a good place to jump start a pharmacy career.
good,I enjoyed working at Coram. They have good benefits. Employees are really knowledgeable. I have learned a lot of billing in a healthcare setting.
good,Great department of co-workers that have worked together for a lengthy amount of time.  Our department comes together as a cohesive unit to offer financial support.
good,"Not that great of a place to work, friendly staff, poor management, Best part of the job helping people find the things they need"
good,We were always busy and back to back not enough workers. Even with overtime. The call volume was bigger then the team. Needed more people.
good,"Good job for someone while going to school. Great management and employees, Flexible schedule due to the amount of hours open."
good,"I enjoyed cvs, but it's very time consuming and you must work as a team with coworkers to establish a connection. I enjoyed my pharmacist, these are the people who mak your day go by smooth."
good,Working as a pharmacy technician is a very difficult job that requires someone who can perform well under heavy pressure. Management at my store was excellent and they were very friendly. Co-workers were very friendly and easy to bond with. The hardest part of the job was how much work you put in and how little pay you receive. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and taking care of people.
good,Working in TCS is cool. But to get into new technology might not be easy here. I like to learn new technology. I always keep me updated with the ongoing technology market but not enough scope here. I would love to work in Big data technologies
good,"CVS/ Pharmacy is a very fast-paced stressful place to work at. The company expects a lot from their technicians with little to no help. The pharmacist is limited in the amount of hours they can give to their technicians and the hours do not account for the new hired employees. The co-workers I used to work with possessed a unique talent, and everyone collaborated together to work towards a goal; whether it be providing great customer service or to perform top in the district for inventory management and workflow. The toughest part of the job is attempting to reach the set goals with little help. When a store is doing more than 400 scripts a day with just 2-3 technicians it is difficult to manage the workflow. However, the most rewarding part about the job is being able to train new employees and bringing out the best of them. Training is the key to a successful business. When these new hires are trained properly, together, we can work to give quality service to customers."
good,"A typical day at work day at CVS, I came in you'd put your lab coat on and clock in and look at the time board to see where you are suppose to be (working the cash register or counting pills) till time change. Then I would always have to straighten up from the night before because not everyone would clean up after themselves. Check the waiting bin for past date pick up prescriptions, call to see if the patient would be coming in that day to pick it up, while also helping waiting on customers and answering phone calls. I learned a lot while working at CVS, I learned more about how to multitask and better ways to help the customers. I learned about inventory and I loved learning about the medicines and what they where for and how they worked. The management is honestly why I left. It wasn't ran like it should have been, my boss wasn't my biggest fan, only because I am an opinionated and she didn't like that. I just had better ways of doing things,which I will say she did set me as an example to our employees and wanted everyone to learn from me. But other than that the management was okay, I did like that if I had a problem and my bosses couldn't or wouldn't help me, I could always go above them with no questions asked. Most of my co-workers where great! We got along well and worked great together, some better than others, but that's expected in every job. The hardest part of my job was honestly the customers.Even tho I always found a way to please them, it was the hardest part of my job. I would much rather count the pills and talk to a customer over the phone than deal with"
good,"Poor wages, and never any set hours to work, they are scatter brained when it comes communicating to the customer, there processes are not very clear to the customers."
good,"Recently bought out by CVS, so we are not sure what the outcome will be. This is an average company to work for. Money is average and benefits are average."
good,"Supportive work environment, nice regular customers. Doesn't pay well, even for experienced techs. Great and helpful co-workers"
good,"This is a great place to start your profession, meet new and diverse people, and grow as a professional. But the job is less about healthcare quality and more about meeting quotas and turn around time."
good,The company is leading chain of pharmacies in the US and is well suited to work for enthusiast personalities. Cons are that sometimes the workload is too high.
good,Management is difficult. Long hours....and the quality of clientele that comes to the store are difficult as well. (30%). To survive you need a high-performing team otherwise...it will be horrible. Lots of paperwork and unnecessary programs.
good,Responsible for all aspects of running a CVS Pharmacy.  They grew real big and lost touch of their team.  They made alot of big changes in a short time.  Not aot of happy employees!!!
good,"CVS is typically a very high stress workplace.  The customers are very demanding, often mistaken, and treat you like a McDonald's employee.  The co-workers are usually fun and the only part of my day I look forward to.  Management is always on the customer's side.  I learned many things at CVS, from work ethic to customer service.  The hardest part of the job is realizing that you never get enough pay for the amount of hardship that is thrust in your face."
good,fast paced pharmacy that is starting to let the customers not be the first priority. a lot of red tape and not much room for advancement. love to train people and see the results but a good amount of over-turn. have learned many aspects of the pharmacy and even more about customer service.
good,"Really busy, hectic, under paid. Fulfilling if your interest lies in making people feel better. There is a lot of interaction with customers. Really nice working with my specific team in canton, Mi. Really nice for resume building because you receive experience in many areas related to pharmacy, such as lead positions, inventory management, scheduling roles, information on different insurance companies, otc medications and products, and most importantly develop really close relationships with the regular customers."
good,Hard working individuals who strive for excellent customer service by personally talking to each customer during each visit.
good,"A good place  to work with "
good,CVS is a good place to work for. A typical day at CVS is just crazy all the way around. I enjoyed working there for the 5 years I did but it is not a place I would have wanted to be with for the rest of my life. Also here there is no room for advancement unless you become store manager or a Pharmacist.
good,Management was unable to assist you. Their HR department was of no help when asking questions about benefits. The job was not hard just they would make you work overtime and not give you any notice.
good,"CVS has provided me with a steady employment.  Pharmacists have  the opportunity to work as many hours as they like; this is very positive for new graduate students or anyone that would like to earn additional money.  CVS has many, many locations throughout the United States which makes the possibility of transferring to another location a very real opportunity."
good,typing rx's into computer system answering phone calls talking to doctors offices and insurance companies filling prescriptions helping customers
good,"It was a desent place to work, but they didn't offer enough hours so I could get full time hours and benefits. They did train me for my job."
good,This company has a good salary but the job can be physically and mentally demanding.  It requires a long hour shift without a mandatory 30-minute lunch.
good,this job had its challenges. nonetheless I walk away be a great experience and the ability to manage and run a tem effectively.
good,"The companies main focus is customer based. Their main priority is how we can improve to make their (the customer's) day better. Unfortunately, there are problems with the lower management that causes tension in the work place. Along with over-worked and under-paid employees. Overall; it was a decent experience because I learned a lot. however I am not fully pleased on how the company treats its staff.."
good,"i loved interacting with the regular customers and helping them with any problems they were having, and i also loved the problem solving"
good,Ok place to work. Management is great and friendly staff also.Customers  are rude all day and every day. Non stop all day long along with long hours.
good,come into work and then at the start of shift answer calls and document tickets and the company seemed more worried about the metrics in place and the stats than actually giving tools for successful resolution.
good,Its a Fortune 10 company. Management is different between departments. Co-workers and working atmosphere is different between departments.
good,Omnicare employees are hard workers we do whatever is needed to get the job done. I love the passion the companty has for their customers.
good,"Imagine being in a tornado and you are standing right in the middle of it where the air is just turning around and around you. You will be safe as long as you stay within that little circle. Well that's what an everyday workflow is at my store, it is very important to start strong and make sure things go according to work flow other wise you will be turning in that tornado yourself and taking your team down with you. Most enjoyable part is my staff :) I learned to much to some it all up but mostly I learned how to better manage a workflow and be stronger in more areas that I would not think I would be capable of handling."
good,Learned multitasking duties every day. It is a good place to start to have experience in the pharmacy technician career
good,It was a pretty good place to work and the pay wasn't bad. I would recommend CVS to others. Co-workers were great and we were a really good team and accomplished a lot.
good,ok company.  Could use some improvement.  Good place to gain experience and has advancement potential.  Would possibly work here again
good,"overall the company needs to be ""remodeled"". If that was to happen their turn over rates would decrease. I did learn a lot at the company in spite of what I went through."
good,The job as a clinical pharmacist was better than I had expected and I really enjoyed working there.However I did not receive much feed back on my performance.I had no idea if I was doing what was expected of me.I learned a lot and this experience added to my job skills.The work environment was great with very little stress compared to all the years I have spent in retail pharmacy.
good,"Busy typical day at work."
good,I submit all IV medication prior authorizations to insurance companies for patients that reside in long term care facilities. I answer phones and provide great customer service. The best part of the job is working at your own pace. The hardest part if the job is the fact that no one seems to have any answers. Everyone plays the guessing game.
good,A lot of work and not enough qualified employees to do the job the right way. Very very unorganized. Very very unorganized.
good,"Great employees, but management doesn't acknowledge the distance we go through to excel in customer satisfaction scores."
good,they are really strict on the budget. very hard to get hours if you are part-time. part time receives no benefits. the company is ok. if you are a tech make it a stepping stone you will be treated better somewhere else.
good,Working for retail was ok but not for me not enough interaction for me. Also it was hard moving up in the company. But working with the staff was awesome.
good,"I accept and process client prescriptions.  It is a busy store with many challenging situations.  There is exposure to constantly changing insurance processing and pharmacy procedures.  I have been involved with the training of technicians to the new software when it rolled out and continue to keep fellow technician aware of changes in the system.  Because of the quantity of work we process, it is necessary to have open communication and cooperation.  It is rewarding to successfully assist client through their insurance difficulties.  The hardest part of the job is when we are limited to short hours.  We must adjust to provide the same quality service, even when scheduling does not permit enough technicians to handle stations."
good,This was my first ever job and it was nice. I learned alot i would have stayed longer but the store got robbed and i had the gun pointed at me and my mother thought i should leave.
good,"CVS is a good company to work for but it is difficult to move up as the promoting from within is not steady. The company, or more specifically my team would rather hire a lead analyst from outside the company than promote from within."
good,productive fast pace workplace insentive pay job is fisical with heavey lifting the only thing in this area that pays anything
good,"Great place to work part-time while enrolled as a full-time student.  However, now that I have graduated it is time to grow my career."
good,The hardest part of the job was that merchandise was not always where it was supposed to be.  Good co-workers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that I moved around and was not standing in one spot during my shift.
good,"This job was a challenge for me. I enjoyed my work, but management always had drama going on. When I mean drama, I mean the managers were accused of playing favorites and were being investigated."
good,"busy fast pace pharmacy. like work flow. long hours, 12 hours days. co-workers had no team work. hardest part of job was getting the employees to work their schedule for a full week"
good,fill people prescriptions out and make sure their insurance go through our system. Give people there medications and there discounts on meds.
good,"Every day begins with return to stock and day 6 counts. cleaning the  station abd begian with yout duties based on your station, most of the time,  you can start filling perscriptions that are acute and waiters , then fill time ordered prescriptions. the best and hardest part of the job is to fill faster than they come in. i enjoy the challenge and fun fast pace of the place."
good,"Upon arriving check in with ID.  Open register, print overnight forms, wait on customers, file, answer phones.  "
good,Assist Pharmacist with filling Prescriptions and assist customers with any questions that they may have which includes locating OTC products.
good,"Great Staff, Fast Paced, No Breaks, No room for advancement, cutting tech hours, overall great customers, continuing education through in house modules"
good,"A typical day at work for me is as soon as I get there I already know what to do and depending on the time of day I know where to start whether it's pick-up or production.  What I've learned the most is how to really multi-task, I mean Really Multi-Task, because CVS works off of short staffed, most of the day there's only 1 pharmacist and 1 technician there, so you really have to know how to hustle.  Management is ok, I love my pharmacy manager she's awesome and she's the best at teaching you how to multi-task. The hardest part of my job is when there is only two of us working and the pharmacist has to go to lunch and then I have to handle everything by myself. Pick-up, Drop-off, production and the phones sometimes it's really tough.  The most enjoyable part of my job is accomplishing all of my task that has to be completed through out the day as busy and hard as it is by the end of my shift."
good,"Nice and friendly organization multicultural environment . Job advancements were available , people friendly ,  quick and fast services"
good,Great place to work. Great coworkers and I had a great supervisor. The hours were usually 40 per week with very little ot.
good,"It's a very fast paste job, which makes times goes by fast. "
good,"This job was my second job and I liked the slow paced job. It was a break for me from my full time job at wawa which is a faced pace job. I would put up sales tags, do photos, handle incoming calls with customer concerns, etc. The management needed work cause certain people got away with certain things where I got blamed cause I was one of their hard workers."
good,I have learned to deal with the public a typical day at CVS is normally very busy and hectic due to not enough staff . Most of the time 1 person is doing multiple peoples job for a low pay.
good,Nice place to work. Ok pay. Management leave some things to be desired. Nice location. Co-workers are nice and diverse.
good,I loved my job here except for when they terminated me because the board took extra long with approving my permit. Overtime was nice.
good,this job is a learning experience everyday. i truly enjoy working with my co-workers and helping our customers on a daily basis.
good,"good money, too many random personalities. Solid work days, if you were good, your bonuses would always reflect it. very clean place as well"
good,CVS is a great company to work for when it comes to advancement and company drive.  The compensation package is excellent for field management.  The culture of the company isn't the best and at times very difficult to feel valued.  There ar many competing initiatives and expectations.  If you are willing to dedicate yourself 200% you will be extremely successful at CVS.  The company promotes from within so the sky is the limit.
good,"managed a store of approximately 10 hourly associates, 3 shift supervisors, responsible for all operational aspects of day to day business."
good,ITs an okay place to work for ... just don't make a long term career out of it.  Work is stressful and fun at the same time...but constantly being pulled like a toy puppet
good,"A typical day at  work would involve filling customers prescriptions,locating customers prescriptions in bins for pick-up, typing customers prescriptions to be filled, answering phones, stocking prescriptions bottles, and other various tasks. I got along with many of my co-workers there the hardest part of the job was the rotations of stations."
good,"Had lots of fun in my time with CVS Pharmacy. It was incredibly busy, as the store I worked in is the largest in town. "
good,there wasn't a lot of room for growth and the hours are not ideal. Work a lot of weekends and sometimes after midnight.Overall this was a great started job.
good,was a knew experience just because it was my first job and it was a good time will it lasted. co workers were very nice and polite as well as the manager and supervisor. I never really had a problem with anyone there it was mostly a good time
good,"the company is really slow with hiring process and advancement in the company, job turn around is very high people dont typically stay long"
good,"I only worked at OMNICARE for a few months, the people were nice and the data entry department was constantly busy especially with the phone calls. What I didn't like about it was sitting at a computer for 8 hours a day."
good,Everyday is challenging and fast pace. I live to assist the customers and provide excellent customer service. The hardest part is being on your feet for long periods.
good,what i loved most was my customers. i didnt believe til i lived it. i really did build a relationship with the regular customers that used to come in all the time for any little thing.
good,"friendly staff, they are very lenient, they try to work around your schedule, they are flexible. A typical day in cvs is to make sure everything is in stock greet and help any customer. enjoyed all my co workers."
good,"the pharmacy I worked at was always busy, some customers were really disrespectful and some were really nice. But people were rude all the time. You never rest in this job, there's always something to do. I had amazing co-workers. I learned a lot there and it was really beneficial."
good,"I worked in a very busy pharmacy, which made it very stressful. Most feel its not worth the low pay offered. In my opinion its a great temporary job, you will learn a lot and gain a multitude of skills and experience. At the end of the day, its not a high paying job, not something to retire on."
good,"Customer service, taking customers to items, answering their questions, restocking inventory, working overnight with delivery"
good,"I like the changes CVS is making to be an overall healthcare provider."
good,"I have enjoyed working with cvs health, they have good pay, benefits and programs for employees. Overall it is a good company to work for but at times management is petty and unorganized"
good,"Cvs is a great place to shop, however in terms of work place enviroment it isn't the greatest. the pay is one of the lowest that I've come across working in the parmacutical field. Customer service is number one than are the employees and their needs."
good,"I feel that my pharmacy knowledge is not utilized to the fullest. It's all about the numbers, which is the case with all big corporations"
good,"Great place to work just a lot of hours including mandatory to work 6 days a week sometimes 7. They say their short breaks are 15 minutes but its really 8 minutes. Also their lunch breaks is suppose to be 25 minutes but its really 18 to 20 minutes. And if you apply for DPS Picking position, then make sure you know that you're a fast worker because they go by picking rate and that's how you keep a job. If your rate is low, then its going to cost you a job there (basically going to get fired). The best department to work in is Outbound because you just load and unload trucks and there is no rate in that department so you can just work your own paste. I'm not saying perform slow but just make sure you get orders right which is easy and less stressful than DPS Picking. Also the trucks have a cooler which is suppose to keep the products cool which is perfect for the loaders and unloaders to not get hot while working when its hot outside."
good,"I worked at CVS for 5.5 years. It's a good place to work at, however, there are limitations which restricts a person from achieving their highest goal."
good,"A great job to start off if your intetested in going into pharmacy school. Ability to comprehend billing and coding, generics and brands. How to read and distinguish proper rx prescriptions."
good,The company is great and the people you meet are amazing if you have a good manager that wants to help you be successful then you are set.
good,"Great training and learning opportunities."
good,was only there as a extern. seems like a good company to work for. lots of it workers have been there for years. was fun while it lasted
good,Employment at this company is ideal for someone just entering the workforce or for someone looking for supplemental income working part-time hours.
good,"This is a well established Pharmacy with 2500 to 3000 scripts a week.   There were several well established Pharmacy Technicians with 10, 15 year plus experience. .  The personnel turn over for new hires is high and not a good fit for a new Pharmacy Technician.  They do not have time to train a non-experienced Pharmacy Technician.  What they need are Pharmacy Technicians who have been in the business for years."
good,My typical day at work is very fast paced. There is A LOT of work that needs to be done in a short amount of time but there is a lot of people to get it done. I have learned countless things during my employment here and I would honestly recommend it to any entry-level technician. The hardest part of the job is realizing there is not much room for growth. The best part would definitely be the laid back environment with some of the greatest co-workers I've had.
good,"Taking phone calls, receiving phone calls and answering customer emails. The company does not value their employees."
good,Pay is low to start but you receive raises. there is room to work your way up in the company. you can advance pretty quickly.great company to work for
good,Filling prescriptions for patients from many different countries and cultures. Staffing is an issue. Customer service is most enjoyable about the job.
good,This is a company and a job thats a good introduction to the pharmacy feild. Also a good first step on the road to better jobs and opertunities
good,"I loved working for CVS, always busy and I enjoyed that. I didn't care for management they could be rude and not understanding. They always turned a 3 person task into a 1 person task."
good,Cvs is a respectable company to work for.  They are very clear about their expectations and give you plenty to keep busy with.
good,"Small stores, friendly teams, and a great place to work. With the new Tobacco-free system, they are definitely trending in the right direction."
good,This was a great job if you dicount the lack of leadership in the managent standpoint. They are not helpful and give alot of pushback when you have a manager take over.
good,I have found that this company does not necessarily care about its employees.  I know multiple employees who suffer from anxiety issues that they contribute to their job environment.
good,"the job did great on training, but could have used better insurance coverage and other coverage for employees. Did have quality cafeteria options."
good,Can be a fast paced environment depending on the prescription volume of the store. Management is very hands on. I learned how to be an effective technician. Work days can be predictable depending if preparation is done in advance. Organization is the key to being successful. Co workers come from all different backgrounds. Hardest part is anticipating a rush or dealing with a series of customers who need medication urgently.
good,"This place sold the Little Rock location in 2004.  This company was being ran by a family member of a competitor, therefore this person, i feel was not really trying hard to make this company prosper.  He left the company in about 2002, and another inexperienced manager ran the sinking ship until it was sold to a competitor."
good,"I find Coram to be a frustrating workplace, especially since CVS took over. As was typical of CVS retail, they expect you to produce more and more with less and less. We are constantly fighting against ridiculous supply restrictions which force certain processes to take more time. With hours regularly being cut back, time is not something we have a lot of."
good,"My job had a lot of variety - I never knew from one day to the next what my tasks would be, which I really enjoyed.  During my time at Coram, I learned new software (such as Lawson and Content Manager) and had the pleasure of working with a great team.  The hardest part of the job was when it ended and the Accounting team was moved out of state.  The most enjoyable part was the interaction between the vendors and fellow employees"
good,"This was a part time position. I enjoyed working with the customers.  I entered scripts, counted pills, making the scripts ready for the pharmacists to verify."
good,I would have to say that it's an awesome company to expand your knowledge in what customer service truly means. It's very hands on and demands a lot of our time and effort into making the company look good.
good,"CVS Caremark is a good company to work for. Great coworkers. However It is a very stressful environment. Very busy. No matter how the weather is, this company never closes. Also, management make promises they don't keep.."
good,Cvs was a friendly work place.Was able take on a lot of different roles in the work place. Manager make sure you was multitask able.
good,"Worked in retail pharmacy dealing with all forms of insurance, all types of prescriptions, immunizations, inventory, prescription maintenance."
good,"Overall, great place to work.  Casual dress with occasional super dress.  People are great and friendly.  High quality expectations, which is great for any company."
good,"Busy, educational, understaffed at times. Easy place to work. A quick productive day but can also be challenging sometimes. I learned a lot  about what the drugs do."
good,compounding is a thing here.  Learned about narcotics and pharmacy ways.  IV infusions and Stat orders going out. Sent out meds to nursing homes
good,I had a great time working with my co-workers but it became more about the money than the customers and that is not what I wanted out of my job.
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers and our pharamcist in our daily tasks.  I was part-time, therefor, my hours were allover the place.  I had different days and hours everyweek, and sometimes we part-timers were asked to change hours with the ""Interns"" (Student Pharmacists) to accommodate their needs.  We, at CVS pharmacy, had a 15 minutes wait time.  Insurance was constantly changing even without notice.  While providing customer service to our costumers, we also type in the prescription orders, work at prodoction, answeres phones, call doctors, call insurances, call other pharmacies, and call back our customers, and work at drive-thru.  I enjoy working there because I like science.  In my days, we were voted one of the best CVS Pharmacy regional.  We also were graded 100% a couple of times in audits.  The hardest thing about working for CVS pharmacy was that my hours were not stable and at times not being able to help a customer fast enough because of insurance issues. Not limited to others not following up with doctors and insurance company and with customers about the situation.  Because of the job it demands of an individual that works there, the pharmacy at times has difficulty keeping workers, but  I lasted 5 years."
good,"Most days are non-stop from the beginning to the end of the day. Workload is overwhelming and stressful at times. Company has very high standards to follow and sometimes we can not get everything done that is expected of us, some goals are just unattainable with the amount of hours we are allocated.  Most of my fellow co-workers are hard working and are very sweet and we work really well as a team. I learned you have to have a lot of patience and be very understanding and sympathetic to our customers needs. Made a lot of friends with my customers over the years, and miss them dearly."
good,"Typically I would cashier, and balance my drawer and also assist the pharmacist, fill prescriptions, and enter customer data in the computer."
good,"I've learned many aspects of the pharmacy industry, from medical records to working first hand in the pharmacy to audits and setting insurance up for patients, the coworkers were all great and have many friends from years of working there"
good,CVS/Caremark was a good employer in that they paid well and they were active in the community. I also miss the special-events they do each year. My co-workers were friendly and management was great in which they gave annual raises regardless of your job-performance.
good,"Work start as soon as I clocked in to work. I work behind the counter to receive and process prescriptions. I work in a production department whereby I print out label, pull medications from shelve, count pills or sometimes pull the counted and bottled pills from the pharmacy robot. I take a thirty minutes break  and return to work until I closed for my shift. Sometimes, I work at the drive through and sometimes I work as a cahier."
good,"Honestly, I will start off by saying, I actually really enjoy my job. I enjoy what I do, who I do it with, and the person's I have the privilege to interact with when I work whether it be fellow co-workers or customers. I actually love my job. Sounds hokey. I really get a kick out of what I do, but I didn't say I loved CVS as a company."
good,Loved this job for years but when new managment came in it all went down hill. When new managment comes in i believe they should not forget the ones who have been there all along.
good,"I learned alot at Omnicare. I got along well with other people. I enjoyed what I was doing, My co-workers were very nice. It was in a convenient lacation"
good,a typical day was I came in clock in then I unload  the truck and stock the products and sometimes cashier. the best  thing was the people I people I work with we where all the same age so we had a lot in common. the hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks with only two people sometime it took 4 to 5 hours.  and my supervisor was pretty flexible
good,the job itself was not terrible what so ever. it was more the hours that killed me the most. they were unwilling to help me try to move to a different shift.
good,I don't feel the training was adequate.  The people were friendly and the job demanded much.  I didn't like part time cause I was working minimum wage and did not get 30 hours in at times.  The day went by fast. But the pharmacist was not the most patient person though she was nice.
good,"This company has room for advancement, there is a multitude of different things that can be done.  You have to work across different departments to ensure your member is taken care of."
good,"A typical shift at CVS begins with restocking all merchandise that has been purchased during the previous day, while continuously providing exceptional customer service.  I learned basic manager and supervisor skills as well as pharmacy technician duties.  I had the privilege of working with many great and hard working associates that helped keep the store incredible. Hardest part of working for CVS is that doctors say they are gonna call in medications right away and alot of patients come in expecting them to be ready immediately and they haven't even been called in yet. The customers become very upset when they cant get there medications right away. I enjoy the family atmosphere, how the customers come in and know you by your name."
good,I help customers with finding items in the store. I ring up their purchases.
good,"Paying attention to detail is a must on this job, and battling with insurance company rejections is probably the worst part. Other than that, the patients are great once they get to know you!!!"
good,"My typical day was on phones chasing prescriptions from annoyed doctors for furious nurses for very sick people.  The hours were constantly changing, overtime was often required, and the culture was that no matter how nasty the client was you had to have a smile in your voice.  It was tough."
good,Coram has a excellent home infusion program. Insurance complexity sometimes a challenge in regards to patient care. The complexity of MD's doing own infusion in offices a new challenge.
good,Coram is a place where you are able to learn new skills constantly. There are opportunities for those who work hard and desire to learn.  This a good place to develop many professional skills.
good,On average the pharmacy i came from filled anywhere from 500 to  800 prescriptions a day.  The lines through the drive through and the register where almost always non-stop.  There where days when the work load was so high and so fast paced it would make the customers yell all day and the employees crack under the pressure and begin to snap at each other and or cry.
good,"Go in to work and help the other co workers finish their shift, then start on our shift work which is filling scipts, working very hard to get out in time."
good,I entered and edited prescription orders and resolved customer issues over the telephone.  My co-workers were all very nice.  I learned that it's very important to manage time and prioritize what is most important.  The hardest part of the job was constantly sitting in front of a computer.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the overall friendly atmosphere.
good,the people in winsboro pharmacy is terrible to work with no team effort
good,"Answering phones was the only thing I did all day at this job. I learned that Health care is really a cash cow. management was horrible, they had no intention to get to know you the person, all they focused on was a body in a seat to answer a phone. I worked with some awesome coworkers. I did not enjoy this job at all."
good,"15 + years working in the Advertising Department putting together the weekly circular. Fast pace, deadline driven department with great results."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be counting pills,making insurance calls, customer service, and doing my best to make sure everyone is pleased."
good,I loved the job and what i was learning but as a head of household i just needed more. Especially for the responsibilities i held
good,It's a fun place to work.  Every day you learn something new and my coworkers are the best part as they are always there to help.
good,"Was hired recently with the promise by the recruiter that I would work morning shift ending around 5:30. When orientation comes along, we're told that we could be assigned to any shift, especially the late morning/afternoon shifts. "
good,never enough help to do the job we are suppose to do It's a very stressed job to have.
good,"Mgt was not so good to work with "
good,"Productive, spent my time making sure billing was correct and paid, if not I would call insurance companies to see why billing was denied or under paid"
good,"My typical day at work involves starting photo lab machines, updating the click count, running test on the machines, taking care of the chemical aspects. Place orders, price orders, scan new deliveries in with the gun.. Assisting outside agents over the phone when they are troubleshooting kiosks or printers issues. Reroute photo orders to different locations and all mini lab related issues. My job involves greeting my costumers, walking them to the isle, checking in stocking if a purchase is not in the front store and fast speed at check out."
good,"This job (as in most jobs) is only as difficult as you make it. Your success here depends on how well/fast you are able to learn the procedures and computer system functions. Upon being hired there is a short crash course on this but after that it is really up to you to catch on. "
good,"I have learned a lot more about the cash register than what I have learned from pervious jobs. They have some decent people to work with, but wasn't there long enough to really get to know them very well."
good,"Working as a cashier in CVS Heath for more than 6 years learned me how to be patient with different customers and situation. Although it is hard to make everybody satisfied, but at the end of the day to feel you have a great effort to bring smile to too many faces."
good,I worked at the same location for 20 years--my patients were the most enjoyable part of my work.  I knew their whole families and drug histories.  The hardest part of the job were the ever mounting job specs and acronyms involving efficiency charts...certainly important to the business model but I became disillusioned with the amount of time and importance that was assigned to this area and not in the area of patient interactions and counseling.  Management were unlikely be positive and more likely to be completely focused on the bottom line.
good,"Good people and environment. I enjoyed helping customers in the pharmacy and front store with a smile always and letting them know that we are here to help always."
good,"This is a High paced, stressful and steep learning curve. scheduling is never done early a day or two in advance of the next week. Never predictable  are  unless you limit when your available which will then decrease your hours. For a health care concerned company the benefits are poor"
good,I learned so much in such little time at CVS. I learned how to fill prescriptions and inventory all of the medication. Overall it was a good place to work.
good,"Over demanding, fast paced and constant changing of procedures and policies to keep up with state and federal changes"
good,"A typical work day for me was creating a great walk-in and drive-thru experience for my customers. The relationships I shared with my co-workers is one I'll never forget. We got along great and worked well with one another. When one of us was down, the other would pitch in to help anyway they could. The hardest part about this job was not being able to always provide my customers with what they needed when it involved insurance problems and sometimes having a medication out of stock, but the most enjoyable part was seeing those that we could help smile."
good,"I would refill patients medications over the phone,call center job. I would also work on different programs such as changing medications from a 30 to 90 day supply."
good,"I learned how to deliver prescriptions in a timely, responsible manner."
good,For the most part you should be able to keep up at a decent pace as a pharmacist and multitask accordingly
good,"• Interview patients to gather needed information prior to recommending a prescription or nonprescription therapy"
good,"Registered nurse with many years of experience is a wide range of practice fields from bedside critical care to home and long term care settings. "
good,"My typical day at work was, ensuring that I got to work on time."
good,"Not the best job for someone with a family to support. If your trying to work somewhere and go to college too, this would be ideal."
good,"Not enough employees to handle volume, short breaks and not a very productive work flow"
good,A typical work days starts out being a 8-10 hour day but ends up being 12-14 hours. Very poor management however co-workers are awesome. The hardest part of the job is the outrageous hours. the most enjoyable part is the people you get to be around.
good,The coworkers were great but the company insisted on understaffing the stores.
good,It was a new learning experience to further the knowledge of my career. Had to meet a goal of calls per day and sent out meds in a correct manner with correct dosage. Hardest part of the day was when I was not able to get in contact with the patients physicians and had to continue trying. The most enjoyable part of the job was the end of the day with goals met.
good,"Fast paced, typical pharmacy work. I like the computer system and how prescriptions are processed."
good,Overall CVS is a good company to work if your are just getting into the field of Pharmacy
good,"Great place to work if you are looking to get into the pharmacy market, but growth seems to be an ongoing issue."
good,"enjoyed going to work and assiting the elderly, i was provided the opportunity to further my job skills in the billing field"
good,"A great first place to start in management. You stock your own areas, sell out of your own areas, hire your own staff, fun environment. Down side was too many long time employees that didnt want new blood in the store would cause lots of drama."
good,"Billed insurances, Spoke with patients about their prescriptions, informed patients about available prescriptions over the counter. Conducted inventory."
good,"customer service, cashier clerk, stocker, photo lab clerk, signed stock in. trained new employees when needed,"
good,"Typical day at work cashier, stocking, passport photos, and money transfer / money orders."
good,Management Sucks. ok place to start and gain experience as a pharmacy technician
good,its difficult to keep up with all perscriptions that are needed to be filled and they are always due at the same times
good,"Okay place to work, liked the people I worked with, not the best benefits."
good,"On a normal day we fill about 400 prescriptions. The hardest part of the job is dealing with insurance issues and being able to keep up with all of the prescriptions that need to be filled while also trying to assist everyone that is calling the pharmacy, dropping off, or picking up their medications. During our "" rush hours"" it becomes very tough keep up all that is going on. I enjoy making costumers smile, and I appreciate customers who are empathetic to my co-workers and I when there is a lot going on. I have learned how to interpret prescriptions and I have gotten a better understanding of how different insurance companies work, and I have learned what different medications are used for and how they interact with the body."
good,"Very busy workplace and often understaffed. I didn't feel this is a place where you can advance.  "
good,Large Corporate company with a large market share for long term care.
good,"I started working at Bojangles' when I was sixteen years old. I was still in high school but I wanted to make my own money. Taking orders was not as easy as I thought but once I got used to it, it was a piece of cake. Greeting customers with a happy voice and a smile ment you would get the same reaction in return. Our managers encouraged us to suggest a menu item when greeting someone and most times it worked. I was the youngest of all of my co-workers but I got along with them just fine. The hardest part of that job was probably cooking and keeping product up which i never had to do. I enjoyed working early in the morning when the older crowd customers came in."
good,"A typical day at CVS  consists of stocking and organizing new and old merchandise into storage and on the floor to sell. Last but not least at the end of employees shifts and time shifts I count money from each drawer to turn in. "
good,"On a normal day we fill about 400 prescriptions. The hardest part of the job is dealing with insurance issues and being able to keep up with all of the prescriptions that need to be filled while also trying to assist everyone that is calling the pharmacy, dropping off ,or picking up there medications. During our ""rush hours"" it becomes very tough keep up all that is going on. I enjoy making customers smile, and I appreciate customers who are empathetic to my co-workers and I when there is a lot going on. I have learned how to interpret prescriptions and I have gotten a better understanding of how different insurance companies work, and I have learned what different medications are used for and how they interact with the body."
good,"My experience at CVS health was one interesting journey. I was able to learn the ends and outs of retail pharmacy, straight out of school. I also, intern there, which was a huge difference than being employed there. I was certainly able to utilize the skills I acquired while attending school. Taught me a lot about customer service and patient care."
good,Its a good work environment. You are up and moving and working in different areas. It allows you to interact with customers face to face and develop great customer service skills and relationships with customers.
good,"This store is extremely busy and there was never enough workers scheduled."
good,Nice compay to have open availability . Nice family oriented environment.
good,"learned the basic pharmacy tools"
good,Was a good place to work with quality people and advancement
good,"Pharmacy Technician, CVS Pharmacy Stafford, VA Care, Fredericksburg, VA.                Assisted pharmacist with preparation and dispensing of pharmaceuticals.  Developed familiarity with drug classification and routinely prescribed medications.  Responsible for computer inputting, verification and tracking of prescriptions, and pharmacy inventory.  Assisted customers with resolution of insurance issues."
good,"This was an enjoyable place to work, as most coworkers were fun to work with. However, there were multiple times where we were severely understaffed. Pharmacists don't get lunch breaks and have to work multiple 14 hour days. I was promised raises and never given them, I ultimately would never work here again."
good,"Good company to work for, common issues with upper management. Advancement and issue and a positive. All managers stay for a while so it is difficult to advance as they are not expanding like they have been in the past."
good,"It is a great place to work, though some bias is visible at times. Great management over all. Co-workers are nice."
good,Good company with great benefits but management is horrible.  Vacations get denied half the time no matter how long ago you request them.  Good job security but no Job/Life balance.  Expect to make CVS your first priority and forget about family.
good,"Typical day at work entails dispensing and verifying between 300-500 prescriptions daily.  Also administer flu/Tdap/Pneumovax/Zostavax vaccinations to the public under protocol.  Take prescription orders via fax, telephone, supervise technicians, provide customer service, consultations.  In addition maintain inventory on sherves and make sure work flow is efficient and productive at all times in the pharmacy.  "
good,Complete ability to get to know the customers. I learned how to keep the pharmacy inventory. Keeping a good relationship with the pharmacist was important.
good,This company is great for young hard working individuals that are just graduating from college and are looking for long term growth through a retail company setting.
good,The company is experiencing rapid growth and change. There are many people being hired and the organization is rapidly evolving.
good,"The hours weren't stable. Overall, the store I work at is a great place to work, Its my pleasure assisting people with their daily needs."
good,"A typical day is running trying to take care of any and all problems. I learned how to be proficient at my job. As far as management goes, it started out excellent then tailed off. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers. Hardest part of the job was the lunch time and after school/work traffic. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers."
good,A typical day at Cvs was usually very busy. We were always under staffed due to the allotted hours given by the district.
good,"maintain work space and teamworker, hard worker and  good work space."
good,"Growing company with growing pains, needs to think about employees rather than just the shareholder."
good,"Have to not only do my job (verifying, patient counselling) but also the technicians job (work drop off for 10 hours +, All PCQ calls (RPh and techs), etc."
good,"*Planning out the days tasks for a productive work day."
good,CVS is a great place to work just looking for a different environment and need more stable hours. Overall I enjoy my job at CVS.
good,I am grateful for this company to hire me straight out of school with no experience. I learned a lot from my Pharmacist and other co-workers. I also met some great customers who became friends. It was a fun place to work but hectic at the same time.
good,"While working at CVS/Caremark, I learned about Pharmaceutical benefits and diffrent medinces."
good,"working at CVS was an okay experience. i didnt learn much, except how to do a lot of things wrong because training wasnt the best. it was hard to warm up to co workers."
good,"Support and Maintenance of Retro and other apps "
good,Every day my goal is to help people and make a difference. My focus is making a better company and member experience. I couldn't accomplish this without the expertise of my co-workers. I continue to learn and grow from them.
good,This was my first job. I did enjoy working for them. I miss everyone who was there. I hear they all moved on to bigger and better things.
good,CVS Caremark seemed like a really nice company to work for on the surface. The colleagues I worked for and with were amazing people. I worked with some amazing co-workers that were there to help each other deliver the products in the most effective and efficient way.
good,"My daily routine is helping out customers with their purchases and questions. Stocking up the shelves and cleaning the sales floor. I learned to better my interpersonal and communication skills. My co-workers showed me what teamwork is all about. The hardtes part of the job would be Unlaoding the weekly turck for inventory, because the shipping totes would be damaged and improperly stacked on the palates. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the satisfication the customers get after helping them."
good,"Recognized for ability to manage a high volume of patient accounts. Consult with hundreds of physicians and patients to fill prescriptions, review side effects, discuss drug interactions and resolve medication delivery problems."
good,A typical day at CVS was making phone calls to the customers. I learned that you can't make people do something they don't want to do no matter how many times you call them about their medications. The most enjoyable part of my job was clocking out.
good,You could find a job security here but upper management is not here.
good,"CVS is a fast-paced environment that services many customers on a daily basis. In addition to filling the hundreds of prescriptions, daily functions will include making phone calls to customers, placing orders, and conducting inventory counts."
good,I was a part time pharmacy technician so had to go to different locations every other week. Other then that it was OK.
good,It is what it is. A job. Just keep your head down and work. Stay out of the office drama and you will be fine.
good,overall not a bad experience..Learned many things about pharmacy and love my co-workers
good,Nice but busy place to work. I learned a lot about medications while working there and it benefited me because I was in nursing school at the time.
good,"my typical day consists with customer service, greeting patients, answering phone calls, calling the doctors and insurance companies"
good,I have learned so much from the pharmacists and other tech's they aren't worried about Sharing the knowledge of the job Great store to work in
good,"Cvs was overall an alright place to work at,the people i worked with for the most part had great personalities.The lack of pay and advancement was the downfall to working here."
good,"fast , paced and lots of rude customers..........a great place to work around educated people"
good,It was great for a first job. I manged to move up the ranks and learned a lot.
good,You learn a lot from working in the pharmacy but I think techs are underpaid compared to all the tasks that they have to perform. Minimum pay should be $12/hr but very good learning experience.
good,it was hard working here because the employees did not work together and they did not communicate with each other
good,"A typical day at work was usually me as the head cashier; scanning items, money tendering, greeting all customers and maintaining a clean work station. On load days, I would unload my section of the store which was stationary and once I was done with my load I would help other co-workers finish their sections. On days that I was not a cashier, I helped in the photo department by printing pictures and helping customers at the Kodak photo Kiosk. I also made keys, stocked shelves and helped customers daily."
good,"A great company but a few flaws in the structure and the overall flow. A huge lack in communication, and expectations."
good,"On a typical day, there is great opportunity for multi-tasking in different stages of medication filling. I really put my best here despite the poor remuneration. The immediate management seemed more interested in their personal advancement than the overall welfare of junior staff. However it was nice working with co-staff and I appreciate their effort in helping training me. The hardest part of the job was dealing angry customers at the drive-thru especially in an environment where some of the customers are illegal drug users"
good,it was my first tech job had alot of fun learning with my staff you may have some bad days but knowing that you supplied customers with great service tops it all
good,"Just like with Walgreens, this is a place better suited for someone that is not a single parent."
good,"It is fun if you can work under pressure because people tend to arrive around the same time to the restaurant, so then you must rush and park cars and remember to do everything correctly."
good,"The company does its best to create a balance between driving customer service and increasing revenues.  If you like the fast pace and the challenges of fixing numbers, then this job is what you want.  There will be stressful times, but there will also be some rewarding ones.  Ultimately, CVS is listed on the Forbes list and because of the employees' hard work at the retail stores, that's possible.  You definitely have to put the work in to improve the numbers they use as measurements for the store's performance."
good,"In-House duties include:"
good,"A typical day at work is doing inventory cycle counts,checking in outside vender order,getting stocked up for the day, filling prescriptions for 6 hours,either drive- thru or front cashier for pharmacy and answer phone calls."
good,"Currently working as a night pharmacist, not terribly challenging.  again very typical retail setting."
good,"I type and fill p[rescriptions throughout the day. Also, i answer telephones and provide customer service at all workstations such as pick up and drive thru"
good,"- lack of documentation made for a very strong working team"
good,A typical day as a pharmacy technician would be starting your day at 8:45 AM greeting public and co-workers. Assisting Pharmacist filling prescriptions and helping customers on the floor finding what they need along with ringing up the sales. Closing register at night. I would order customers merchandise if we did not provide it in our store. The hardest part of being a pharmacy tech was waiting on the customer when they were not feeling well. The most enjoyable part of a pharmacy tech was providing professional team and public relation help and seeing the customer satisfied.
good,The environment is comfortable and I've learned alot. There's not alot of communication with co-workers and the hardest part of the job is being out of the loop of new things of the company and sharing ideas with co-workers.
good,Typical retail environment where more is expected to be done with each passing quarter. Training is in place for all employees so all employees can grow to be well rounded.
good,so this is a great place to work. very easy job duites and worflow. Not much room for advancement or trainings outside the scope for which you're hired but still a decent place to work.
good,"nothing was ever good enough for the managment.Very negative work environment. I tried to implement some positive feedback to co-workers,then corperate would come in and stop the positive reenforcement with negative feedback."
good,daily met the phamacists and then the docors and detailed about my product what there scope and after made available in both stockists and retail outlets.i have done a satisfied work that organisation with good understanding.for my better future i have shifted from that.
good,"Retail is retail. It's all about who you work with, not for. Filled prescriptions interact with customers, etc."
good,stressful and busy store. it was a great experience for new student. counseled patients and formed great relationships with doctors.
good,"Review mineral ownerwhip and prepare runsheets and reports,"
good,I was there for 6 months and could never make a break away from the cash register. I have 17 years pharmacy experience yet was only allowed to run a register and do the job no one else wanted to do. I had to quit and move on with a hope of doing more in life with my college degree and years of experience.
good,"The best part about managing a CVS pharmacy is staff development, teaching your interns how to counsel/interact with patients, and serving the community as a trusted healthcare professional."
good,take prescriptions and type them in follow up with doctors and insurance companies fill and organize medication for customers and greet all customers with a smile
good,Most all employees I spoke with were unhappy with our work conditions.  We would work 8-9 hours without a lunch break or 15 minute break.  The pharmacist worked 14 hours straight without a break also.  I'm just not sure how this is legal or ethical.
good,"With this job you had to deal with all types of people, when I started this job it was in the changing process from PEOPLE,S drug store to CVS. but we had to deal with a lot of thief and drug addict robbing us"
good,Typical retail pharmacy position. Rude customers that blame you for their insurance charging them a copay. Very busy with lots of standing and minimal lunch breaks.
good,Nice place to work. Good insurance coverage.  Atmosphere had room for improvement.  Teamwork could have been more impressed upon staff.
good,"I do enjoy working at CVS Caremark as a pharmacy technician, however this job is temporary and I am currently eager to find work so that I can use all my work experience to please my next employer."
good,An alright starter job for a 16 year old just starting out working
good,"At the CVS pharmacy where I was employed at was a great store, all the staff members were professional and friendly. We were always productive and doing our jobs. The management was great kept the store and employees on their A game."
good,this is nice job. we can meet new people and know them personally aswell.
good,"I like my co-workers. The management in my store is great. Have not enjoyed the cutbacks on technician hours, that leaves the pharmacy running on a skeleton crew."
good,love cvs. enough said. just need to give us our hours back. let us have all of our staff back and we will get stuff done!
good,"Review daily workflow, make sure employees are present and focused, provide support and knowledge of our systems, employee daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly reviews."
good,"Had a great time serving customers and making a difference."
good,Typical retail pharmacy setting with team work and medium script count
good,"Omnicare is primarly a pharmacy, The respiratory department was always second. Omnicare sold the respiratory division."
good,"I learned how to pull EOB's, the collections process, billing process and everything in between."
good,Worked in fairly small department and found many workers had been there all their lives and were not very open to change.
good,I am currently employed at CVS/Caremark. I am usually operating the automated dispensing unit which is a fast paced dispensing machine that labels the original stock bottles. I make sure that the channels are full for it to dispense the needed medications. I also train new employees on how to operate the machine. I also work in the area where we manually dispense prescriptions. The employees at CVS/ Caremark work well together. Management is helpful with anything that we need to do our job. I don't feel that this is a company that I  can stay at because I would like to go back to a first shift job.
good,Training was good.  Hard working group of people.  Learned more about different software.
good,"okay place to work, just need more work on training people... also in need of overnight position for the business"
good,The people at corporate suck!  They cut hours and overwork you to death.
good,"the customers our like family, and its little staff for a lot of work so you need to be able to multitask"
good,Perform a quality check on each case completed by co-workers before the case is closed out.
good,"•	Process both film and digital prints for customers"
good,Completing prior authorizations and appeals for approval of medications with members of Medicare part D
good,"A good place to work, but I am looking to further my career. it is very customer service oriented. coworkers and management are very friendly. a great place to build experience. The pay is very low, based on the responsibilities at hand."
good,Quality company to work for. unfortunately the company downsized and decided to close their newest site in the area i lived.
good,"A typical day at work here is fast paced, and always changing, I love my job and what I do, I just have been waiting forever to get my insurance, and my benefits, but cannot seem to get a straight answer"
good,"give you outrageous numbers to meet"
good,	Provided outstanding customer service by acknowledging incoming/outgoing clientele and offering assistance
good,i have already submitted this review. CVS is a great company to work for. Thanks
good,It has been a very long time since I worked there and didn't stay there very long. What I do remember is there was never a set schedule. Every week the schedule changed which I didn't like.
good,"A good stepping stone to learn the craft, but little opportunity to advance or gain compensation for knowledge gained."
good,I really enjoyed working here. Its a challenge. You can challenge yourself to be a better employee. The hours are hard but you can make a good living if you are willing to work hard and work late(overtime).
good,"customer service and billing"
good,Customer service position fielding calls for specialty medication orders
good,"It is very fast pace and enjoyable work. It was fun working with the co-workers, because they all come from different background and ethnicity. I had to take calls and deal with the patients at the same time. I had to type and fil prescriptions in 3 to 5 minutes. The hardest part of this job was organizing and getting everything done on time or before 3 minutes to maintain customer service."
good,My typical night at CVS for the overnight shift was pretty simple just go in sort the containers out to the right ailes and put the food away on the right shelves. It's not to busy at night so the work pace was pretty steady were you can get if not all but most of your work done. The manager and co-workers were nice people that helped whenever you needed it and i would recommend it to everyone sign apply for CVS.
good,"Meeting deadlines and supporting where need be when meeting my own deadlines,"
good,"Very busy place to work not with  allot of down time, but really enjoyed the people i worked  with . I was really good with time management."
good,I do prior authorizations I learn how to approve based on standard guide lines and when to send information to the pharmacist for further review if I cant approve a medication. I love my co-workers and there is nothing hard about my job and the most enjoyable part is being around my co-workers
good,Immediately log into phones and make doctor calls previewing mistakes and translation discrepancies. Its an innovative company that tries to keep their employees happy.
good,"It was a productive work place, not all work and no play. Answering questions about mbrs medical insurance, ordering medications"
good,steady work flow. good interaction with customers. focus on pt care. great staff.
good,Good Company to work for with good benefits. Lots of overtime to be had.  Great group of people as well.
good,9 hour work day 4 days a week with a 4 hour work day on Friday. I learned to apply or post cash after extensive research of payment information of checks for prescriptions from a query and company based site system user information. Management was supportive in making sure all information was available to be productive and complete the daily task. Everyone had their own sites to post cash and produce a complete packet at the end of each day for total cash posted and applied. The hardest part of the job was trying to post as much cash as possible as long as there were no holds on the checks or payment information pending. The most enjoyable part of the job was posting millions of dollars and having everything balance to the penny. But it was equally challenging to not balance and have to find the difference.
good,"Filling technician, with multiple duties.  Fill patient prescriptions for each individual patient tote that ran on a conveyor belt throughout the whole facility.  Work in a bulk area, dispensing liquids  from a bulk bottle to a liquid vial per amount that was ordered.  Maintain stock for the A-frame machine that automatically dispenses medications as needed.  In down time, prepare specific numbers of supplies that are ordered by common quantities so that when production become busy it was quickly and efficiently dispensed in a smoothly running, timely manner.  As needed, pack orders to get them ready for the shipment processing stations.  Also as needed, work in the manifesting area, scanning the items packing label for a shipping label, always verifying that the patient name was correct with the packing label.  Then, applying the labels on the boxes, which then transferred to another conveyor belt that could sort the packages to the correct shipping area."
good,"Great place to work for, offering part and full time jobs. The pay scale is a little low for the amount of work and safety needed. Delivering medical supplies should be in the hazardous category, so workers would make more income."
good,"Busy "
good,"This company can be difficult to advance in.  Raises are only annual which is only 2% and there is a pay cut off (after reaching a specific amount you can no longer get a raise).  Breaks are frowned upon.  Be sure when you're hired that you make it clear you will be taking them.  To sum it up this is a good place to start as a pharmacy technician, you learn a little of everything just know going in that the work demand is high and the rewards are rare."
good,Fast pace and very productive. You meet all kinds of interesting people.
good,"I work at a 24 hour store which is very busy. A typical day at work includes entering prescritpions, filling new and renewed prescriptions, contacting doctors and insurance companies, servicing customers."
good,"enjoyed working here.  fast pace and lots of people"
good,"There's a list,you call from it.  Only so many Pharacists exist in the US, you hire one with a sign on bonus, he stays for a year, then moves to another company for the same package until they are making $$$$.  Good profession to be in."
good,At CVS it is all about who you are. The majority of the staff in Kilmarnock were ok but as you get higher up they are not very friendly.
good,Overall good company but some of the pharmacy co-workers were very impersonal and did not like change. The patients and workers on the retail side of the store were the best part of coming to work.
good,"A great place to become a maverick in pharmacy technician , fast paced. Hands on customer service, a must in expierence in becoming best at multi tasking."
good,"Did my clinical hours in these Pharmacies. nice to have the opportunity to work with them,   At  the time they had no open positions to offer."
good,"I really enjoy this job and my co workers. I have learned a lot about the healthcare industry and I am excited to learn more, the most difficult part for me has been insurances and I feel like I have progressed in the last few weeks, there are a few rejections that I am still working on."
good,I liked the people I worked with. the company is not the easiest company to work for.
good,"I loved working at CVS. CVS is a very busy place to be, where you encounter many, many, many different personalities. I learned how to deal with those personalities, insurance companies, different drugs and how to communicate effectively with people. it got very difficult at certain times of the day when it was the busiest but after that I enjoyed when a customer would come up to you to say thank you for helping them receive there much needed medication. I loved working with my co-workers and manager. We were a team and got things done but unfortunately the pay wasn't enough for the amount of work that got done throughout the day."
good,"I recently was offered the oppurtunity for a job title change from pharmacy technician to inventory specialist. The most difficult daily task would be having too much work and not enough staff on-duty, however I've been a tech for 18 years and enjoy what I do."
good,"-Filling prescriptions, dealing with sick customers"
good,This was my first corporate job. It was also my first job that got me into medical billing. I learned a lot from my management team and learned a lot about how to perform and succeed in the corporate world. I like when the company was PCS heath systems is was small but seeing how fast the corporate world changes. Made me aware how to handle change and grow with it. hardest part was volume of claims I had to do best part I got to listen to my music with my earphones.
good,Working on my daily emailed issues from other departments. I learned how to become an efficient trainer. My supervisor was amazing he was the one to push me to become the SME trainer. Which i fell in love being a trainer. The hardest part was the long drive to work.
good,Company focused on finding ways to differentiate itself in the market.
good,"Work has a balance between working in team and individually."
good,"-Verify prescription information"
good,"~Provide assistance for Pharmacies, Doctor Offices and CVS members"
good,Typical work week entails being a cashier and handling thousands of dollars daily.  Once a week Load comes into the store and employees stock the shelves on the sales floor.  Co-Workers are friendly.
good,Good company but it was only a temp job and Was not for a very long time
good,"We have screens on the computer that have peoples names and the what drug they are trying to get filled we spend most of our day trying to make sure that peoples medications are filled on time and filled correctly.  The Pharmacy Tech's job is to fill prescriptions on time and with the right medication. The Pharmacist job is to check the prescriptions we have filled and to make sure they have the correct medicine and about of medicine prescribed by the Doctor. This is a long process since most days we have at least 4 to 5 pages in the computer and each page has 16 people on it that need prescriptions filled.  I feel most accomplished when me and my team member work together to get all of the pages in the computer done in a timely fashion.  If you don't work together it becomes very difficult to get things done, so being a team player is a big part of our job.  My favorite part is when costumers come in and are happy that there prescriptions are filled on time and thank you for doing a good job.  I love working with people and it makes me proud when people appreciate what I have done for them."
good,very very busy!!! i enjoyed working with the customers and co workers worked as a team
good,Does not provide the ability to grow and promote yourself within the company
good,"Training was to be 7 weeks, lucky if it was 3. When released to floor answering calls no support by supervisors. Customer would hold forever while I was trying to find answers or ask questions."
good,This face paced retail pharmacy requires you to be on your toes at all times. Multitasking skills are a must have. There is a lot  learn here.
good,They offer a world of promising job opportunities across a diverse range of career areas.
good,It is a good company to work for and to learn about the way things are handled behind the scenes of such a large company.
good,"Good place to work great hours,but pay scale is low. The company has a good vacation package and the tools to do your job."
good,I would go in and help fill medications and answer phones. My coworkers were nice. I learned that I have to handle a lot all at once. The most enjoyable was seeing all the regulars that were really nice. The biggest challenge was learning how balance many tasks at once.
good,Not much race diversity in the district and regional levels of management
good,"Typical day was very busy, Learned how to work photo machines, copy machines and was head cashier. Nothing too hard that i couldn't handle most enjoyable part was being their able to work and help customers."
good,lots of corporate involvement. Too many call to make throughout the day
good,"A typical day at work is like any other ordinary retail job. You come in clock,in and take care of your responsibilities. I didnt really learn much but just how the store and the company works in terms of how the money comes in and how its used. Lately management has been  cut down im guessing cause of budget issues. My cowarks are fine cant really complain, you have you friendly ones annoying ones and mean co-workers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with people drama honestly.The most I like about the job is that i can move freely around the store instead of be stuck at a register"
good,I had learned a lot throught this company and would love nothing more then to have been able to stay if still in that area.It was a caring and fast paced enviorment.
good,A great learning experience. The people were great to work with and management was nice.
good,A typical day at work involves lots of calls to patients who detest it most of the time
good,"This CVS is no longer available for discussion. The store has changed hands, management, pharmacists, and techs."
good,"A typical day at work involves stocking merchandise, being a cashier, and working in pharmacy."
good,"I was able to gain a wide variety of knowledge including medical knowledge, and knowledge of how to manage co-workers."
good,"I have worked at CVS for 6 years, and it hasn't been worth it.  The pay is horrible and I'm still barely making over minimum wage.  My co-workers were great though, and made the days very enjoyable."
good,"It was my first job, learned alot,about management , operations, cash handling etc."
good,"Enjoy the job.  A typical day is sending out all medical for customers quickly and accurately.  The time restraints and proper handling of all equipment as well as supplies.  Management is available for assistance.  Like my co-workers, team players.  Hardest part of the job finding space to work in.  Easiest part is knowing what is expected for that day and success at the end."
good,"Working with CVS Caremark was delightful. I love helping others the best way I know how. Customer service was priority with this employer. I would answer inbound calls to help customers navigate thru the CVS.com webpage. I learned how to be extremely patient. Management will always push you to strive for a better position. My co-workers were very friendly and accommodating. The start of a new job is the hardest, making new friends, knowing and adjusting to the way things work. I'm a fast learner and hard worker. I enjoyed helping customers find a resolution."
good,"Fast-paced work environment.  People are nice.  They were very helpful.  I was just an extern, but they treated me like a regular employee."
good,The location I work at is very fast paced and extremely busy. I have learned everything about insurance and a lot about the make up of drugs and interactions. The upper management of this district at CVS pharmacy is not as good as I have seen it in other regions. My co-workers are great and are very smart and stay on top of everything that a pharmacy technician needs to know. The hardest part of the job is not having enough time to get everything done during the day that upper management wants done besides filling prescriptions and customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job is being around my co-workers and the customers I have formed a bond with.
good,"Lots of training, gain much experience. Team working place."
good,Patient load is light.  Management is very helpful.  Co-workers are all well knowlledgeable.  Driving long distances is the hardest part of the job.
good,I enjoyed my co-workers.  It helped on days when they were stressful.
good,Busy...Lots of emails ..High focus on customer service...Lots of phone calls and metric demands.
good,"My day starts out with cleaning up from the shift before, to make sure All work station have enough supplies to get through our morning deliveries. Then Clock-In and start by getting the receiving area ready for the daily in coming freight. On a daily basic it  is any where from 30 pallets of mixed products to many many more."
good,typical day at work was great I got to  meet loving customers.
good,"I have learned how to fill prescriptions by billing insurance companies, knowing what medication the doctor has written for the patient and customer service.  During the day my co-workers and I rotate positions between typing prescriptions, finding and counting the correct medication and assisting the patient at the register.  Although we occasionally have upset patients, the most enjoyable part of my job is when there is an issue either with the patients insurance company or medication and I am able to solve the problem in a positive manner."
good,"normal daily duties to assist in a high volume pharmacy, working with customers, pharmacists, insurance companies, data entry, phones."
good,"After clocking in, check the board for assigned station and duties.  I learned all about what it means to be a pharmacy technician.  Computer work, cash register, counting meds, measuring liquid drugs, maintaining logs, and making sure all meds were accounted for at the end of the day.  And to ensure the customer was picking up all that were ready for them.  Management for the store was awesome.  Very good to work with.  The pharmacy manager was always inconsistent.  Sometimes they weren't so nice.  Some co-workers weren't always in the best of moods.  So you kind of had to see how best to work around them.  The hardest part of the job was having to be there and there wasn't much left to do later in the evenings.  And learning to work some of the computer screens.  That was a little complicated and difficult to navigate.  Especially if you were stuck at the cash register and didn't get much opportunity for experience on it.  Serving the customers was the most wonderful part of the job.  I really enjoy providing great customer service.  And not all customers are easy to deal with.  But not a problem for me."
good,Deadlines and reporting was the hardest part of this job. Very micromanaged job.  Loved my experienced and well trained staff.  Too much turnover in management.
good,Work is crazy. I can learn a lot. Management is ok. Co-workers are great. Awesome to work with. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers. The most enjoyable part is making the customers happy.
good,"MY job is very busy . I type and fill prescription, answers phones, help ring up customers. Help out pharmacist and other co-worker when needed. call insurance when need to to fix a problem. call customers to let them know if there a problem with there prescription. clean and stock the pharmacy and order in things we are out of in the store."
good,"A typical day at work can be busy and challenging.  I love the customer service aspect of the job; the Branch Manager, Pharmacy Director, and Director of Nursing are all top-notch.  Most of my co-workers are terrific people, but there are always one or two exceptions.  The best part of the job is helping people."
good,"A typical day at work is to fill prescriptions and handle calls, customers, and insurance.  I learned a lot about drugs.  The management was okay.  My co-workers were not that friendly, but nevertheless, I worked with them without getting into any arguments.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with people and a fast-paced environment at the same time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of satisfaction whenever I was able to relieve or help with the customers' medical issues."
good,I stated my day stocking and clean. Not much fun but nice to work.
good,The hardest part of this job is working with a software that always have defect.
good,"Call Physician Office for patients' refill approval, print out all script refill line, fill all medications, wait on customers and cash them out. I learned so much about drugs and their interaction."
good,Being a tech was a very rewarding job. After 8 years of service I no longer felt valued as an employee and felt it was time for me to move on.
good,A typical day at CVS pharmacy starts at 7:30 when I get to work to complete managerial projects. On a typical day  the store fills about 500 prescriptions. One pharmacist is on duty per day and works from 8 am to 10 pm. The most difficult part of the job is the long day without a break. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help ensure every patient can afford their medication and understands exactly what it is for. The other part of the job that I enjoy is being able to vaccinate patients and have the opportunity to get to know them as a person
good,Each employee has the opportunity to enhance the lives of customers through meaningful interactions. The management at CVS/Pharmacy does what is necessary to keep customers happy and incite them to return for future business.The hardest part of this job unfortunately is not having a consistent work schedule from week to week. The most enjoyable part of this job is receiving genuine appreciation from customers after helping  with their transaction.
good,This is a very high volume store that is consistently busy. I am part of a team that seems to be divided and everyone is okay with that. I am a very hard working individual that believes in team work. Management is fair on some days and on others not so much. Not too much consistency in management. I enjoy helping the general public and explaining insurance.
good,Team oriented and customer base gave me lots of verbal and technical skills for any other job.
good,was a very good learning experience. learned a lot for this field working here.
good,"A typical day  at work for me, is to go in and set up my station to have a more productive day the the day before. I also make sure that I have everything I need from the start to avoid getting up and roaming around. "
good,Every policy gets changed all the time.  You might do a job this way on Monday but by Tuesday its changed.  You never know if you are coming or going.
good,You don't have to deal with any patient. Closed door pharmacy.
good,The typical chain pharmacy that could use more employees but not a bad place to work!
good,"It's a retail job.... so you know what to expect ... Customer Service .... Sales and merchandise, etc"
good,"Many different tasks to do, from merchandising, to deliveries, to resets, cashiering, payroll, etc. Learned time management skills to complete tasks assigned for that day and also how to deal with train new employees. Management would let you know what they expected of you and work very well with you. Some of the co-workers were a little difficult to work with while others were fantastic."
good,"Company is in a lot of trouble with Medicare, Not a stable work environment"
good,"While working at CVS I was taught to value the customer. Working in retail taught me to manage my time effectively, have very good work ethic and work well in a team setting. I was given the opportunity to advance in the company as well as given more responsibilities"
good,"Working at CVS Pharmacy is no walk in the park. This pharmacy has very high volume and keeps you multitasking for the entire day. The benefits are good, and the pay is not bad. They are able to work with your schedule at the 24 hour stores. I would say it’s a great place to start and get lots of experience."
good,"Enjoyable talking and, taking care of customers. I have learned how to deal with customer issues on problems that they have. When it comes to my customers they come first and, long with all of my other job duties."
good,"flexible hours, can move around jobs fairly easily, room to grow in company."
good,"Most customers who come to CVS are state workers and people who live downtown.  The pharmacy is very small, too small for how many patients they do eveyday.  The associates who work up front are very nice, but it is hard to keep a smile when you have such rude customers.  During the day we get slammed by the lunch break of state workers and in the afternoon we get hit hard with students coming from school.  Overall it is a very busy and some what crazy day here."
good,"overall nice to work but never enough help so pretty stressful, also the pay is pretty low"
good,"CVS is a very productive place to work. There is always something to do and a lot to learn about the pharmacy. For the most part I enjoy working with my fellow employees, however we are all on different pages therefore disrupting the work flow. Management is okay, however there is always room for improvement. I genuinely love my job and what I do, it is just not enjoyable anymore at CVS. They have a way of diminishing the excitement of working. I just think the should show the employees of CVS a little more appreciation."
good,"This is a  good job.  The people that work here are great.  The management is very hands off, tends to be a good thing and a bad thing.  The best part of this job is the people you get to work with every day."
good,I liked working with the people there. I was busy at times but slow at others.
good,"typical pharmacy tech duties, counting prescription working with other techs and various work shifts. Answer phones - communicating with Drs and Insurance companies."

good,I've been at this job for over 10+ years. Just looking for a change in atmosphere. Co-workers are great. Management team is great.
good,"sign on to an RF gun"
good,Pay is decent but not a great company to work for too many rules and regulations
good,A typical day at work is always challenging and and interesting. I learn something new everyday and that's what I love about it. The store management is a good and helpful team along with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is not being able to give the appropriate and necessary answer to the customer but the most enjoyable part is when the customer leaves with a smile and is satisfied with their overall experience at our pharmacy.
good,Counseling patients on proper medication use; processing of prescription; dispensing medications; providing retail and pharmacy customer service
good,"I learned a lot about customer service."
good,Worked in the pharmacy/store stocking shelves and helping customers who needed help. Very easy job that didn't require much but very short hours.

good,I had learned so much from these folks. It became like a family for me
good,good place to work if your actual Pharmacist. Being a Tech don't get paid much.
good,Enjoyed working with the public. Great place to gain experience.
good,"A typical day at work was assisting customers, fixing price tags,and stocking shelves. I've learned how to multitask and flex time. The management was fair. The hardest part of my job was fixing something someone else messed up, the most enjoyable part of my job was assisting customers."
good,"Schedule patients for shipments, setting up first time shipments, working as a team to finish projects, hardest part is not being able to solve a patient problem. The best part is helping the patients."
good,If you work in a high volume pharmacy then you may have some days that are hell. If you can manage to land a job in a slower business area then the job is quite nice. 
good,The customers are nice and my co-workers are very helpful to me in time of need.
good,"A typical day at work was always be on your toes, and come in prepared to work. I learned all about the pharmacy and how it is important to work as a team. Management was great, and very attentive of went on in the pharmacy. My co-workers worked well in teams, and on deciding on a way to get work done more efficiently. The hardest part of my job would have to be inputting prescriptions. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I left for the day, I left knowing I did a good job, and was able to help the customers and my co-workers to provide the best environment I could. "
good,Corporate Pharmacy. Lots of rules and regulations that get in the way of serving the customer. 
good,Largest company of its kind in the industry.  Recent management changes have streamlined the company.
good,"•Monitor alarms for 8000+ CVS stores to ensure safety and security of employees and products by coordinating with police and fire departments also responsible for data entry of store accounts."
good,"I would receive calls from members who needed to order their prescriptions, also would document and manage their financial payments and renewal prescriptions."

good,Very hands on job and most of the time very busy and I'm able to help others if help is needed which I don't mind. Some of the co-workers are very nice to work with and other just keep their distance. If there ever is a problem there is always someone avail. I just like to start my day of in a great mood and end it the same way and for the most part that is how it goes.
good,This was a good summer job. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming every day.
good,"Ringing customers out"
good,"CVS/Caremark is a good company to work for, however since the beginning of this year there have been a lot of changes. The healthcare options are awful and to cut down on costs, they have changed some exempt employees to non-exempt and bi-weekly pay instead of a weekly pay."
good,"It all depends on what you are doing."
good,"ok company. a lot of workload put on pharmacy staff..great pay, job security."
good,"I was fortunate to have great co-workers."
good,"I was responsible for taking patient prescriptions and inputting them. I was also responsible for counting and measuring the medications and handing them to the pharmacist for a final check. I helped to check out customers with their prescriptions and I worked the drive thru. I was also trained in the front store to help stock, merchandise and cash-out customers. The hardest part of this job was not having enough help to assist the large volume of customers who came to pick up their prescriptions. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with co-workers who were focused on their careers and customer service. "
good,"Provide exceptional customer service in person and via phone."
good,While working at CVS I learned a lot about customer service and how the world of a corporation works. The management knew how to run a profitable store. 
good,"wait on customers and stock shelves all day long"
good,"Ok company to work for, management is alright could be better."
good,"Some potential for advancement"
good,I enjoyed having conversations with the patients. Sometimes the elderly just needs someone to talk to.
good,Worked as shipping and recieving great place and friendly environment.
good,"At first I enjoyed it quite a bit, but after returning from leave after a health scare and continued heath problems I came to see how little the employees were valued. While some members of the team did not pull their weight the ones that did were punished by being pushed harder to compensate all while benefits were cut and chances for advancement were nearly non-existent. The whole company has been restructuring for some time and the HR department may as well not exist since they were pretty much useless; passing off employees to one another in different offices in different states. That being said I did like my managers and many of my co workers. I feel like the issues were handed down from the top and my management team was forced to be in an unfortunate position. "
good,The management was not good at all. Never work with your schedule and if you are a student you will have to quit the school go to work.
good,This was a good fun experience working here althought thhey are all about who they do and dont like. they hire anyone to do the job yet its so hard to get in the door.
good,A typical day consisted of me working behind the counter with the Pharamcist as a Pharmacy technician. I enjoyed the interaction with people and learning the various techniques in mixing medicines for patients.
good,I did customer service for the store systems help desk. It was alright. The training could have been better and the processes/procedures could have been better explained.
good,A long-term-care pharmacy workplace. I worked part-time.
good,"Good place to work, It was only a three month contract, so there was not enough time to form an opinion."
good,mail order prescriptions and helping pharmacy with problems processing orders
good,"a nice place to work, 7am to330pm,a lot, very nice,very helpful and very nice,leaving,knowing that my job was done at 99.99% and i say well .."
good,"We had wonderful management who truly appreciated our hard work. I learned a lot about working as a team to accomplish goals. Eventually, however, pressure from corporate to increase goals became too much. We under-staffed and did not have enough space to fulfill their goals. The best part of this job was by far my co-workers."
good,"Not a bad enviroment, doesnt pay much. Hours getting cut back."
good,"Typical Retail Pharmacy environment. Fast paced, customer based yet corporate lead job."
good,good place to work. Job relocated to different state. All staff was very friendly.
good,I learned a lot about the pharmacy industry. Plenty of overtime.
good,"Omnicare is a company that has endured many changes throughout the past five years. Growth and tenacity are important factors and with the support of new Senior Management, this company should be an inspiration for our growing senior age group that can benefit from this company's assistance."
good,Working for Community Dental the days are fast paced. Lots of work to be done but consistent type of work. Once a rhythm is found the work load is manageable. There was moderate room for advancement. Pay does not balance to work load.
good,receiving inbound calls from member concerning their benefit package contacting appropriate department to assist with prior authorization for prescription order by member doctors placing override to assist member at pharmacy to receive their medication per member benefit plan
good,"Was a relatively nice place to work, but for as important of a job you are doing, the pay should be more. They also dont like to give benefits."
good,"Dealing with customers was very stressful, but some of them were kind and funny. The pharmacist that n charge of pharmacy was intelligent and manage things really well. I enjoyed working under his management"
good,"A good company, however, the company had to do budget cuts/cut back on PT hours, and they were unable to provide me with the basics that I needed. Also, I was new & had just finished basic training of three months, and I was unable to work a lot (frequently & consistently) due to the poor scheduling- in order to learn more & become a faster, more knowledgeable worker. I was very disappointed since I worked very hard in on-line training as well as classes, yet not receiving what I feel I deserved. I would work there again, especially since I completed all the training that was required (I am not a ""certified"" technician though). There was much more to learn for the position I had & I am eager to learn more. It involves a lot of multitasking, patience, consideration & understanding-especially with the customers. Great customer service is key, even just a nice smile and ""have a good day!"". I enjoy people & making them happy. Management was not as good as I think it should have been, and the communication was relatively poor. Communication is very important no matter what the job is, and I felt I had to ask the questions, and repeat my concerns too often, with little or no results in regards to increasing my hours/longer shift. The hardest part of the job was communicating properly, as it was always so busy. Also lack of on the job training."
good,"Nice place to work, You are chanllenged every day by trying to find insurance for residents in nursing home facilities. There are many time constraints as to when billing needs to be completed,as well as using good time management skills to keep organized."
good,"I started by day ensuring all of the scripts have been entered into the computer. This can be tedious as it involves interpreting medical abbreviations and quantifying day supply. I then filled the prescriptions and gave them to the pharmacist to verify, in other words to ensure I did not make a mistake. I learned most of the medical abbreviations, drug uses and drug classes. Quite a bit of time was also devoted to troubleshooting insurance rejections. When a script was rejected, it was my job to find out why and communicate that with the customer. Our pharmacy was small thus we were only allowed to have 1 technician and 1 pharmacist staffed. This was the hardest part of my job. Sometimes I worked with pharmacists who did very little work and thus I ended up with a heavy workload which in turn led to delayed scripts. When the pharmacy was staff with motivated pharmacists, I enjoyed my job quite a bit. I gained satisfaction from keeping on top of the work load without making mistakes. It was sort of a game I made for myself. I was able to maintain relationships with some of the patients which was also enjoyable"
good,"A typical day at work was account reconcilation, insurance and patient billing. I learned a lot about medical reimbursement and medical benefits. The hardest part of any job is to lose a person you've worked with patient or co-worker. The best part of it is when you have helped someone out of a situation they had no understanding of."
good,It's good to work here if this is your first job. You learn a lot and can enhance skills in pharmacy.
good,"A typical day at work would be to always help customers and to constantly face a store, (organizing shelves). The management is friendly and insists that everyone is treated equally. What I have learned from supervising the photo lab at CVS is how to take charge and work with virtually any situation handed to you, weather its employees calling in sick, to satisfying an angry customer. co-workers are very friendly due to the fact that management is kind and polite to their employees. The most difficult part of the job is when a customer is dissatisfied and more must be done to assure their happiness. Lastly, the most enjoyable part is to know that your work was appreciated in every way, and your effort never goes unnoticed"
good,CVS/Pharmacy is a very fast paced organization which requires one to be constantly focused. It also requires a person to have professional skills and communication skills in order to be effective in patient care.
good,Very busy and fast paced work environment.
good,awesome place to work for great management team enjoyed the customers the most.
good,"Ive learned about the different brand/generic forms for drugs. HIPPA regulations. Imputing scripts and insurances and handling rejections. Pharmacy management (not upper) work very well with us, and what we need as a staff. For the most part love my co workers but we all have our days. Hardest part of the job is knowing what we have to do and not being able to get it done due to lack of people. Most enjoyable is having customers come in and be happy to be there because they like us and like how we take care of them."
good,"I enjoyed working for Longs Drugs before CVS Pharmacy bought them out. Working at CVS wasn't the best, but they were flexible enough for me to go to school. I also had numerous transfers which allowed me to gain experience and to learn about other stores. It was alright, but I was very happy to leave the retail world."
good,My co-workers is what keep the production of the pharmacy moving
good,"a typical day at work was running the register and helping customers, also running the photo machines. the one thing i have learned from working there was more patiance .the managment at the location i worked at was most of the time great managment to work for. hardest part about the job was trying to resolve a customers issues to make them happy. The most enjoyable part of the job was the challange of sum of the daily duties and the customers."
good,Overall it is a great work place but there is not enough hours which causes me to not make enough money at CVS Pharmacy.
good,Customer service. If you like the challenges of customer service this is the place for you. You will get good experience in multi-tasking.
good,"Every day is a good challenge that requires mental and physical agility. The teamwork amongst coworkers is something that really shines, since the fast pace can be the most difficult aspect of a typical work day. I've learned how to perform quality work accurately and in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of working here is that the work day just flies by and keeps everyone both stimulated and busy."
good,"worked 2nd shift mostly 7.5 hours per day or less. Learned a lot from insurance companies, medications. Managers always stressed no breaks for them on 14 hour days which is why they are probably that way. Some co-workers were great some were late all the time. Hardest part of job was working with staff that always called out sick, always short staffed. Most enjoyable part were knowing my customers & they knowing me as one of their favorite employees."
good,"A typical day at work is usually a day that is busy and fast paced. Patients may come in all at once and need help with prescriptions or with insurance information and I one of the employees that usually can help resolve the issue or explain to the patient why there the problem with their insurance is occuring. I have learned how to help soothe patients worries and how to help them better understand certain aspects; such as insurance rejections. The hardest part of the job is knowing that a patient has left the pharmacy and still wasn't satisfied, eventhough we tried our best to expain the situation to them. The most most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with patients on a daily basis."
good,"Worked here for almost 3 years and learned a lot. However human service, supervisors and management were very rude and inconsiderate. working almost 3 years, traveling over 2 hours and making the same pay as when i started was very unfair."
good,"The job itself was good , no issues like any & every job everydays different some days are easier than others. With dealing with people it wasnt a problem I'm a very patient and tolerant person, helping customers was very rewarding. I just felt that had no room to grow higher in the company."
good,The best satisfaction is helping others help themselves with their medication therapy and learning that people from all walks of life pretty much share the same issues when it comes to health related concerns.
good,Massive workload without adequate staff makes work difficult. Every aspect of work is monitored: how long it takes to answer the phone to % of past due rx picked up. Co-workers are usually amazing people and are the best part of the job.
good,It is a place to work. CVS has many stores in the Midwest. As a pharmacist you do not get a lunch break.
good,"If you are willing to work hard and dedicate yourself, you can learn a lot from this company."
good,"going to work everyday and helping customers get their medications filled , helping them in anyway that we can workin as a team, also like my co workers who help me and guide me along the way . what makes my job good is that when someone is havin a bad day i smile and make their day better just by a good hi and how are you today"
good,enjoyed working in this company theres just no room for advancement
good,"Okay place to work at. Customers are not nice to the staff, overall the company has good benefits."
good,Formulation Scientist and Drug formulation work. Work with manufacturing of medications at initial stages.
good,"This was an overnight position, and it was too much for me. I had another daytime job along with this one, and I couldn't keep up after a while."
good,nice place to wrk if i had more experience this location was too busy for me customers seemed to get get frustrated since the other people didn't really teach me they just thru me out there to learn
good,"Calling Providers for collection on past due accounts for the Mirena IUD, working on spreadsheet for teammates"
good,I also learned what it takes to be an excellent community pharmacist and to be a health care provider that can help customers have a positive experience in improving their health.
good,Answered calls from members ordering 90-day prescriptions.
good,typical at work has a good atmosphere.work hard for the customer and the job. sometime s hardest part of the job is when people call off and most enjoyable part of the job is at the end to see all the work that was done and how well the store looks. management team shows good leadership and pushes you to the test.
good,My typical day was clock in and stay on the phones waiting for customers to call in about their insurances benefits.
good,"Angry customers that want Longs back, corporate implemeting somthing new everyday, underpaid, and your hard work unappreciated. I loved my challenging job and that I was able to help others but there was definitely room for improvement."
good,"I work within CVS/pharmacy as a Pharmacy Technician where I prepare medication for customers within the production area, I process and apply insurance to medication for customers within the drop off area, I assist the pharmacist with special projects and designated and I also provide excellent customer service to all the customers that come our pharmacy."
good,There is only 1 pharmacist working for almost 14 continuous hours doing much more than 300 Rx a day. Many patients are not friendly. There is hardly any time to speak with patients. Just super busy while managers will keep on nagging you for not asking enough patients about Flu shots!
good,CVS is a good place to work for. They do treat there employees good. The only issue i had was that they refused to give me more hours yet wouldnt work around a second job.
good,"Omnicare is a good company, but it is suffering due to its procedures of how revenue is made; as well as how the company handles the claims. It's a great place to work, but it is a lot of work for little pay."
good,"A typical day at work is handling customers concerns, cares and inventory questions. I've learned how to adapt to any situation and work with different people from different walks of life. The hardest part about the job is trying to do many tasks within very small time frames and getting no help from store manager. Also, handling all calls, attending to vendors and looking out for thefts."
good,"I came from a store that filled approximately 2,100-2,500 rx's/week. Very, very busy location. Starting coming into the pharmacy, waiting on customers, analyzing and fixing rejected insurance claims, accurately typing in new rx's and refill authorizations, filling rx's as they become due for pickup and selling them to customers. Constantly multi-tasking, anywhere from typing in new rx's and answering phones, to filling rx's and selling them, to assisting customers with front store otc selections to ask pharmacist about.Constant phone use with no head-sets. Co-workers have workers compensation claims for neck problems and have heard that they will not be provided a headset for months because of budget freeze (even though it was MD recommendation). On your feet the entire 8-12 hour shift with only a 1/2 an hour lunch break. The days fly by......slavework with little technician appreciation or perks. Reviews almost cease to exist. If you want one, you have to ask (more than 1-2 times......beg), and you are never eligible for even a cost of living pay increase if you don't achieve your stores goals (Triple S), let alone a decent wage increase for promotion. Pharmacists are hired on new with no management experience and receive little knowledge of how to manage technicians in a ""work appropriate"" manner. Overall, a great introduction to what a retail pharmacy could potentially look like working a busy store, but don't recommend staying with the company for a long period of time."
good,the company is a great place to work if youre striving to excel through the compnay hard work doers pay off but keeping the job requires alot of graveling. theres alot of politics within the company.
good,I was a training supervisor and had no idea when they would place me in that position. I was told i would not receive a raise when I was moved. I worked overtime and never received my overtime pay.
good,Flexible hours
good,"I love my job at the Pharmacy, I enjoy doing paperwork, costumer service in spanish,"
good,Moral of team is very low here.
good,"Of my time with CVS/Caremark I learned so much about prescription and medical benefits. A typical day was just production more more more and even more, there was no time to really express empathy. At one time we worked very closely as a team and then things changed and it became dog eat dog everyone for themselves. I would really rather not go into anymore about my former employer."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of 8 hours of speaking with Medicare Part D beneficiaries about information regarding their prescription drug plans. In the nine weeks of training, one learns the ins and outs of the Medicare/Medicaid system, Prescription Drug Plans, Health Insurance, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The atmosphere among coworkers is refreshing and reminiscent of a high school environment. Management varies, depending upon which manager one is working under. The hardest part of the job is retaining the mass amounts of information you have to know. The most enjoyable part of the job is the direct deposit one receives every other Friday."
good,the best part is rolling u-boats and stocking items aisle to aisle
good,"typical day starts with checking temperature of the medicine coolers,"
good,"A typical day at work I made sure the store was clean, cashiering and answering phones trough out the day.In CVS Pharmacy I learned a lot on how to deal with customer concerns, and fix them. Management was great every one was on top of everything, as co workers they were great too we all worked as a team all the time. I would not really say there was a hard part in the job, learned lots of things some harder than others,but it all paid up because customers left happy. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was stocking the store, and helping the elderly shop for the things they needed help with.Helping others always feels great!"
good,"I started at OmniCare when they first opened their Phoenix operation on the 3-11 shift, it was great to be part of a team within a team, there was great respect among co-workers. I was able to learn how to make liquid prescriptions for the long-term patients."
good,"Its cool. just depends on your management and team. Pay is okay, rather work in a institution."
good,This is a 24hr Long term care pharmacy. My Shifts begins at 7pm and ends at 3:30am.I would say the constant need for speed and accuracy is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the sence of accomplishment of getting all the meds filled for each run every night. My coworkers work hard as a team. Management is ok. Working the graveyard shift results in some overlooking of myself and team members but i have learned to look at the bigger picture. Which is the patient who is depending on there meds to be delivered.
good,talking on the phone all day
good,"the company is concerned with numbers, reports & compliance"
good,"a typical day at work would be: ringing up customers, providing customer service, stocking inventory, processing photos"
good,"The job requires an extensive six-week training program. While most obstacles and common inquires were addressed, due to the constant changing environment of the field, even after learning correct procedure one day, it could be entirely different the next day. In a nutshell, there are a finite amount of problems you can encouter, but with a seemingly infinite number of facets. It is a diffucult, fast-paced, constantly changing environment which makes it difficult to obtain a sense of confidence in knowing what you're doing."
good,"I worked from 9-2, and i loved my co workers."
good,"A typical day in this job was going in to work, associating with the supervisor/boss and getting the daily tasks. Once all tasks are completed i would go back for more tasks to be done or help with other things."
good,"Fast paced working environment, hopefully you get to work with a great team and management."
good,Cvs is a great place to work for but there is not very much room for advancement. At time the policies of the company interfer with state and feredal laws.
good,They should pay there employers more for the amount of work they provide and the level of stress that this company evolves
good,Fast paced and productive pharmacy. Required to work quickly and efficiently. Ability to successively multitask is a required skill.
good,"Filled lots of prescriptions every day and especially at the beginning of the month. Helping the elderly understand their insurance, medication, and ways it could impact their lives."
good,Processed prescriptions from various doctors offices. Consult with customers about their medications and worked as a team to fill them. The hours were somewhat flexible and to help customers was thee greatest experience.
good,"Fast Paced Job, Same routine of work everyday, its fun at the same time because you learn about medication and stuff."
good,"productive, less fun and poor in communication amongst coworkers"
good,It is a great place to work with support for employees to be promoted and the chance advance within the company
good,There is not much business at our CVS so we had a lot of down time.
good,* help me to understand work condations in US
good,"Rotating positions between keying new prescriptions in data base, which also requires calling insurance companies as needed; filling prescriptions and finalizing sale at register."
good,Is a good job to have while college. Very good. Not much in advancement and not much on raise pay but very flexible with schedules.
good,I learned a lot about working with other peope and about working in a pharmacy.
good,Slow mornings busy afternoons. Learned about how a home healthcare pharmacy runs. Management could of been betterMade a great friend. Fast paced but I love that. Working with good people and listening to the radio.
good,Busy environment. Always changing so always learning. Always changing. I learned how to read a contract and also how to bill with HCPC codes in units of measurement. The hardest part of the job for some may have been many different personalities however this was an enjoyable part for me because I am people oriented.
good,I have been at Omnicare for the pat two years working in the collections department. My day is spent by making calls to patients and there family. I collect on past due medical bills and also locate insurance and Medicaid for these patients if it is not listed in our records. Prior to working at Omnicare I had never really worked with Medicaid and now I have learned about Medicaid Medicare and Med-d in all of our pharmacies across the United States. My co workers and I work together now instead of having individual accounts we are working from one big pool of accounts so things are different every day. This can be a little challenging but in the long run the idea is to get through all of our accounts and to be cross trained in all states. I started on our DX systems and for the Past year I have used Oasis.
good,I enjoyed my team members and internal partners. However there is an immense amount of organization changes that occur without being clearly communicated to parties involved.
good,"A typical day at CVS i would have to say was busy and fun at the same time, it could have been alot to deal with. Working at cvs I've learned to not take things personnal. Alot of the times the customers just need to vent.You just may be the person that are there for that at given time. I love and enjoyed working with my fellow workers and management team it got tough at time ut we pulled together for one another. The hardest part of my job was not being ale to satisfy someone. There were times when we just didn't have what the customer wanted and there was nothing in replace of that they may wanted so i just felt that i didn't satisfy them.The most enjoyable part of my job was making the customer happy. Hearing someone say thank u, u have made my day. Them saying that made my day."
good,"CVS is a typical retail pharmacy. Cashiering and taking care to make the customer happy is the main goal.. Management varies depending on store, different styles, but generally follows CVS guidelines. Not much respect for my knowledge. Co workers are usually young and looking for job, not a career. Hardest part of job is having nothing to do. I am a doer. Most enjoyable part are the customers, I love people, and enjoy getting to know them"
good,"I learned a lot about working in the pharmacy, The do's and don'ts. The different names of the medications."
good,"CVS was a great place to work. Even though hours were long and days were very busy, I had an excellent staff and the atmosphere was friendly, family-like. My clients were my biggest strength. I got to know many of my patients personally. They trusted my professionalism, and this helped me to become a better pharmacist. CVS challenged me."
good,"Good job, benefits but alot of work and unlicensed associates typing prescriptions."
good,"As working at cvs I was alb to pick up a lot of skills and experience. There I learned how to work several receiving tools; such as, a baler, pallet jack both electric and manual. Also, a fork lifted and other Dayle task as lable makers. I was able to fine toned my skills of malti tasking. My co-worker work well and took direction and allowed me to contribute to them as well. The hardest part of my job would be the time constrain. And the most enjoyable was that the days went by fast and of a hard days work."
good,"Omnicare is not my field of study. It pays the bills. Not great, but its a job. Been a pharmacy technician for 8 years now and have worked in lots of pharmacies, most of which were better than here."
good,"Fast paced, always challenging. You never have a moment to catch your breath. Expectations are very high, support is very low. You have to have thick skin."
good,"• Reviews Clinical diverts received in the Custom Care Mail, Therapeutic Interchange, and/or Dispense as Written departments and evaluates them for Clinical opportunity to address the appropriateness of therapy, generic substitution, or therapeutic interchange opportunities with potential cost savings outcomes."
good,this place was ok poor managment but over all not a bad place with a lot of friendly people
good,"I enjoy my job however im ready to experience something new. I thank CVS for providing me with knowlegde of being a Pharmacy Tech, but for the past 3 years i have been unhappy working there. Too many changes and everything is conducted with a score. They forget about patient values and the whole reason we are there. To help people live longer, healthier lives."
good,CVS is a nice company. I have been a part time worker since 2009.
good,"Ok, I kinda wish I was working here now. I was nicely treated. It was a bit of a dead end job and I was happy to leave it when I did, but in retrospect with the jobs I have now I wish I could be rehired and advance in this position. It wasn't too tough and mostly was fairly simple."
good,"I was frequently requested to fill shifts at locations other than the location considered to be my home store, and management never seemed to be communicative about needs and/or availability, leaving scheduling to the last minute. It became terribly frustrating and confusing for all staff involved. My co-workers were always pleasant and capable which made it easy and enjoyable to work with them, this also made very busy and potentially stressful shifts pass quickly."
good,always busy
good,I have been working at CVS for quite a few years. Average Retail pharmacy job
good,"At the Pharmacy, I learned to work at the register, the drive through counter & gathered a whole new experience. It used to get pretty hectic at times and it was challenging. All in all a good learning experience."
good,they dint pay what should have been paid. the hardest part of the job is that you always have to stay in class.management makes us stay very competetive with allother pharmacies. it gets very old.
good,this job is no longer there we where all downsized lots very big company
good,Can learn a lot as an externship
good,"A typical day of work consisted of going onto the back room of the store and scanning all items and taking a designated amount onto the sales floor. the job also required to post up weekly specials and promotions,provide friendly customer service, as well as straightening and fixing shelfs to provide a welcoming environment, and assisting customers with their questions and concerns."
good,"great place to work, honest people work with, A great place to learn new thing"
good,"I worked at the front end of the store, operated the photo lab and all retail and cash transactions. I stocked shelves, set sales, rotated merchandise, etc. It was a fun job most of the time. I built a really good relationship with customers and enjoyed seeing the regulars every day/week. I had problems with one specific assistant manager who had problems communicating with me as an adult. She also had a very smart-aleck attitude and was super fake. I was asked by the store manager to become a shift supervisor, but I didn't enjoy the late hours (most of the time I worked until midnight). I would work there again, if I had problems finding other employment."
good,"A typical day is usually busy. There are always deadlines to meet and updates to adhere to. This makes adapting to change as strength that is considered a weakness for most people. Co-workers are nice and are always trying to do their best and are always willing to help assist. The hardest part of the job is when mistakes happen, and the results affect the customer."
good,"Fast paste you have to remember a lot of information its a lot of pressure to make sure you don't give out the wrong medication, miscount,fill the wrong drug"
good,"Although it was a summer job I enjoyed coming into work Greeting and Helping customers with finding what they need and how to work with others and how to be organized. The Managers and supervisors help us if we werent sure about somethin they explained how to do it right. the Co workers were young, and jtust learning about working. there wasnt anything hard about the job.The most enjoyable part was helping the diffetent customers"
good,"co-wrokers are fun to work with, and challenage in a professional and productive way."
good,"CVS Pharmacy requires a lot of work for a part-time job, but it is a great way to start your work relationship."
good,"My typical day entailed researching alternate medications for meds that may have been discontinued, calling on Rxs with illegible information, and dealing with some very unprofessional nurses and doctors regardless of the title before their names. I personally didn't have any issues with my co-workers, and found them to be kind, at least the ones I dealt with on a daily basis. I learned the importance of being attentive and careful when it comes to a person's medication and making certain the information is accurate. The hardest part was having to listen to some very unpleasant words, when all I'm trying to do is make sure the patient is getting the correct medication. I loved getting off at 3:30 and working Mon - Fri."
good,"Start the day with looking at the emails, follow up with all the daily paper work that need to be done, then production, typing if there is a patient dropping off, or help with the pick up line, verify RX, call MD for all the RX that need follow up or clarification, counsel patients."
good,"CVS has lots of opportunism. You can do any position you want if you work like a dog to do it. I worked hard of for years trying to get a promotion to a salaried assistant store manager. When I finally got that promotion, they worked me like a slave 80hrs a week and only getting paid for 45 hrs. I held that position for about a year until I got completely fed up when, they literally force me to work overnight (in a non-24 hour store) on Halloween to do xmas resets. I was told, that if I did not work that shift I would be terminated... I had no previous warning of any kind."
good,If you like a 40 hour job base pay doesn't work you past ten hour this is a good job
good,• Developed Design and Data Discovery documents for different applications in the data masking project
good,Great working experience in a pharmacy.Everyone always was a team player.
good,I love my actual job and helping people. This store is very poorly manager however.
good,They Always over worked and under appreciated people. They never recognized people for gping above and beyond.
good,great oppotunity and room for growth. Co-wokers are like family and every few weeks we have pot luck and ice cream giving on breaks for our hard work and meeting company goals.
good,"3rd shift, needed time to go to school. just a job, not a career."
good,"Always non-stop work, extremely busy, sometimes deal with difficult customers but know how to deal."
good,fill alot of rx and very good customer service. love meeting new people everyday co-workers feel like family
good,There is a lot of customer service required for this job. You usually don't have any set hours.
good,"Worked for almost 9 years in the midlands and greenville/upstate area as a technician, intern, graduate intern, and pharmacist. I thought I would be with CVS longer than I ended up being there, but they asked too much out of me."
good,"Was hired as a Senior Process Engineer and created a 7-phase Waterfall methodology for the Development environment, as there was a Agile-type of process in place."
good,Caremark can be at times a great company to work for but they lack the understanding of their emploees needs. Caremark provides great benefits and the environment is very family like. It is hard to move up in the company though.
good,Cvs was a good place to work for. As a Pharmacy Tech. I did learn a lot of new things everyday.
good,"It wasn't the greatest job, but it gave me some good experience"
good,"I worked at CVS/Pharmacy as a pharmacy technician and it really is a mixed bag. The pay is absolutely terrible, worst pharmacy pay I've ever encountered and the benefits aren't too great either. I did like the patient care, this is a company that does a lot to help its patients. The management on a store level is great however the district and regional management is absolutely out of touch with what actually happens at the store level (this is pretty common in the industry)."
good,Warehouse work is physically demanding being on your feet and having to move quickly. There were limited breaks and minimal space to move around. I did not feel this job was right for me so I resigned
good,"You are expected to greet customers upon entry, maintain a clean work space. Organization is key. Dealing with customers face to face requires a lot of patience and understanding. Restocking shelves is required during “slow” periods of time."
good,"This was my firs and longest job I have ever have. A typical day, depending on the time of day of the shift, would be either 4, 6 or 8 hours of work throughout the day. As a cashier, you would either work opening, mid day or closing shifts. Always greeting every customer that enters the store, and wishing them a good day on their way out. I learned how to make customers happy with the help of the staff that work their fields of occupation, whether it is the photo department, or the pharmacy as well. The hardest part of the job is trying to prevent theft of store items, in particular with liquor or makeup, although the security in the business has improved since during and after I left it. The enjoyable part of the job was the nice customers that were our regulars that were always happy to see those of us that worked there for a while. I recommend this job for any kid fresh out of high school trying to get some work experience as they look for a career."
good,"I've been working for CVS for 4-1/2 years now and without getting into too much detail it's a simple retail job. You greet customers, given tasks to perform throughout the shift. If you do a well enough job within a few months you're considered a valued and trust employee provided if you work hard. I"
good,Company is good with bringing in outside people and training them into roles.  Better-trained and better-experienced people seem more often than not to leave several years later.  I had unexpected opportunities to move into new roles.
good,"Great people"
good,It’s not a bad Pt job but a longtime employee who had severe mental issues and no management support during the tirades made it unbearable to work. Besides that the staff and customers were a pleasure to work with.
good,Very fast pace environment so you have to be able to keep up. The hours aren’t very flexible which makes balancing personal life pretty hard. I will say management tries to work with you the best they can with the stipulations they are placed under.
good,I worked in the pharmacy and some of them mistreated me. Some of them learned to be nice to me but my hours were cut when someone got upset with me over nothing. Otherwise I guess it's okay.
good,"Taxing environment, never enough time for breaks. Short staffed and pharmacy managers were overworked. Fast paced learning environment, due to it being a high volume store."
good,"Working at CVS is pretty simple and straightforward. A lot of your duties are learned on the job, and there isn't much variation in the day to day. Be expected to handle multiple (albeit simple) things at once, by yourself, depending on the location."
good,"Not the best but pays after a 5 years or so if your fast paced and ready for a huge workload and are thick skinned you should be fine , try for a union job"
good,Company is ok to work for. There actions are based on pleasing stockholders. At store level have opportunities to maximize sales and results. Although they say they promote a healthy balance of happy home life. To be successful sacrifices must be made.
good,"Work was usually very stressful.  Large volume of scripts per day, very little tech support, no cashiers available.  Misfills  were always a possibility due to workload.  Could not adequately check each prescription and verify their veracity in time allotted, so your ""numbers"" suffered and so did you."
good,Management was excellent! Enjoyed working with variety of customers and employees. team player environment. Variety of job task. Always flexible in work schedule. Very accommodating to my schedule during a difficult family matter.  Pay could have been better.
good,What you would expect from a retail company that cares about script volume.  Nothing to say that is not to be expected.  No huge issues with the company and I knew what to expect
good,"no training very minimal definitely no training to take state exam "
good,many things have changed. I don't know if it is good for everyone as many leave their job and some stay because of seniority. you have to earn it tho. but I would say its okay company
good,CVS is a great fit if you enjoy staying busy. Always a lot to do and a lot is expected from you. Schedule at first is close the store and then the next morning open. Except to prove yourself in all you do.
good,"CVS pharmacy is a good company to work for, ive learned a lot there in my time currently there. Mulit-tasking and quick thinking will help the day go quickly and smoothly. The location i work at is usually quite busy and can frustrating sometimes when teamwork is not a priority. I enjoy helping people find products in the store and doing inventory is fun for me as well."
good,CVS Health was another means of my being able to add a missing link to all of my experience and years of working in healthcare. Making sure I'm sending the correct medication out to a member via.Mail Order is crucial.
good,working in a pharmacy is a hectic and fast paced environment.  you need to be very careful with all that you do when mixing prescriptions.  friendly people
good,Fast paced job walk about eight miles up and down a line. Responsible for your zone. Have to remain at 95 percent pick rate after two weeks. Make sure you have a 98 percent accuracy
good,"20-30 hours part time and fast paced environment. You gain experience in breaking down trucks, stocking shelves, and rotating items per their expiration date."
good,"This customer service job comes with the potential for growth so long as you act upon it yourself. The quality of my experience was largely dependent upon How the shifts were managed and who managed them. Whereas my experience may be different from others, they varied but improved as I made the transition from the front store to the pharmacy."
good,"CVS is a good company to work for unless you want to advance in your career & get annual salary increases. My particular store was full of drama & lazy technicians. It was a high stress job atmosphere so if you don't work well under pressure, I would reccommend another field."
good,"This is my current job now, and i have learned a lot from it. I have learned how to resolve problems with customers or within my store. I have learned to communicate better with my employees and customers. I have great leadership skills that I have built over the 2 years of working here. I train new hires, I do stocking, inventory, returns, cash handling, and to keep the environment positive. My workplace culture is diverse and very flexible with hours."
good,The work is ok but I feel like they ask to much of everybody especially asking for people to work extra hours on their days off. Hard to find balance for family when you've got to be at work 7 days a week at times.
good,Working in retail pharmacy has allowed me to develop excellent customer service skills. Being able to manage my time each and every day is critical in getting all of the paperwork and returns done. Being able to build relationships with those every day customers really makes going to work that much more enjoyable.
good,"Draining job, little hours offered in my store, really not fun but I enjoy working with the friends I've made and talking with regulars when they come in."
good,Job was cool and fun. Enjoyed packing out items and helping customers out. Meeting new people is great. Rules are weird and over the top. Corporate is always looking to fire people for any little thing
good,"A long time ago I worked here as a pharm tech, experiences varied on who was the pharmacist on duty. Work was easy but high paced, patients were and always will be on both sides of the spectrum."
good,"Awful OTJ training,  everyone wanted to keep new people from learning everything they needed to know.  Customer service not good. Bathroom needs ovehaul,  break room also,  both smelly too."
good,"Not a bad place to work. I did a slew of postions from being a cashier, to shift supervisor,  photo lab technician and then finally pharmacy technician."
good,"At first I enjoyed working there. "
good,nice work like balance with start hours. training was good. ability to learn different skills is great. mgmt. was caring. little chaotic as they were bringing on new payor and services.
good,"You answer incoming calls with speed and accuracy and follow call flow guidelines outlined by management. It is actually a good job. I like it, but it is not for everybody, but I work at home as well. Typically after 6 months of employment, you can choose to work at home or stay at the call center. "
good,"1.  Take care of a task and straighten store"
good,The CVS Retail Pharmacies & Call Center were both Very Busy & Very Stressful. I was Always working 12-14hr days w/no life! We were NEVER out of Queue!
good,"I love my job as a pharmacy technician, but cvs is a very frugal company. They refuse to invest in their stores and give their employees more hours. They are the reason why I'm looking for a new job. I have no hours!"
good,"every day that you come into the job if you are in management you re guaranteed to learn something. every day at that place is completely different than the previous, you never know what to expect."
good,"This place is very fast paced and intriguing. Some days are long and fustrating, others are short and exciting. There is no in between at cvs specialty, because no day is ever the same. I could suggest more management training and resolution skills be worked on. I also think that  some of the PSR's there are amazing at what they do, but new hire training should be drastically improved to keep things flowing. You shouldnt expect to find a prefect work place because it absolutely does not exisit. This place is the perfect stepping stone to progressing in your pharmacy career. I rated them 3 stars because improvement is needed asap with their management, approach to employees and their lives, and training new hires. So many mistakes could be avoided and turn over rates could probably improve if you improve those points."
good,"I started here in May of 2019, its not a bad job you just need to pay attention to detail and give out the correction information to members, providers and the pharmacist that call in. Its not as busy as other call centers.... ive worked a 8 hour shift and have only had 7 calls for the whole entire day but it also depends on the queue that you are in. Management seems a bit disorganized and I have noticed some favortisim. You have to be working in the call center for 6 months before you can advance to another department and have no write ups or attendance issues. The benefits are good and the customers usually aernt too bad. Sitting in one spot for 8 hours with short breaks and a short lunch is kind of frustrating sometimes."
good,CVS I started there in 2015 when I returned from living up north. I started as a cashier and quickly moved up to shift manager and then transition to pharmacy and became certified.  There have been many changes recently with benefits and vacation and time off which is upsetting.  Also the hours get cut so bad after season that we can not live on 22 hours for 2 weeks.
good,"Each day at CVS is a great day to be able to provide patient's with a pleasant and informative experience. For example, we like to insure the patient has first had a convenient way of picking up the medication's. In addition, we like to make the interaction while picking up the medicine, as pleasant and personalized as possible."
good,"If you are looking or a summer job, this is the place to go. Had multiple discrepancies with drawer being under, which I was blamed for. I LOVED my managers but this was job was only temporary until I started graduate school."
good,"Cvs has gone from a good place to work to factory job. They used to encourage getting to know your customers but now give no time to even get your work done and take care of the customer. Their ""on paper it should take this long"" philosophy will kill this company in the store level."
good,"A day at work is busy but very stressful at times, but that applies to any job. I got lucky and I have an amazing work family. The job definitely requires patience and the ability to keep your cool, but it can be rewarding at times too. Corporate sucks, they don't really care about the patients, they're mostly concerned about running their business to be the most profitable. They have super strict rules if you work in the pharmacy (like no jackets-- even in the winter, and they don't let you eat during your shift except on break). They cut hours like it's nothing so no one can be scheduled consistently. There aren't many opportunities to move up within the company unless you're a supervisor or pharmacist. The actual good part about the job is the patients (sometimes) and my co-workers! The past two years have been good, just recently corporate has been getting worse and it affects the stores and employees negatively."
good,"they will train and assist in getting techs ready for certification and licensing. They are very flexible with work schedules, making this job perfect for a student."
good,"Cvs overall as a company has many opportunities to grow and elevate within the company, they seek employees from within to promote and the merit raises are great"
good,"Can be stressful depending on the number of technician hours given by the company. Pharmacists rely on their technicians every day, and by limiting their hours we jeopardize our ability to perform at the peak of our profession."
good,I decided to go back to school. This company is good for students they will work with your schedule if u are attending school. The pharmacy is very busy and has a lot of patients
good,Some of the management was poor. Was a set lunch for my department but hardly ever went as scheduled. Then management would get mad cause you didn't go your scheduled time. Can't do that when your on the phone with a patient.
good,Impossible expectations without staff to apply them. They expect you to work hard without proper compensation or recogniton. Unsafe work environment and unfair work practices.
good,"it is a stressful place to work and sometimes long hours as a pharmacy technician. Always cutting hours for the front end of the store. Not a consistent schedule, can't really have work/life balance."
good,I loved what I did and the people I worked with. I do feel that the company does not appreciate the team as much as they should. We are the front line and bear the brunt of everything that happens. Salaries seemed to be arbitrary and some with less experience would get paid more than those with several years experience.
good,Constant work to always stay busy. there was never anytime to chit chat. As long as you worked efficently then you were okay here. I had nothing wrong with the company. Plenty of hours and the pay was plenty able to get me by
good,"Good company in terms of compensation and benefits. constant changes in what the company ceo and management requires. There is no chance of sitting through a 14 hour shift of which 30 minutes break is given. Lunch time often interrupted to attend to customers. A lot of matric scores to met, a lot of unattainable expectations and can be a stressful place to work."
good,"CVS pharmacy is a great stepping stone job for someone who is looking to work in the medical field. I've learned a lot about medication and its usage along with medical insurance. The work place is a very fast-pace environment. The hardest part of the job was that there was no hands-on training, although there are team-members that are willing to help out when in need. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was problem solving. Insurance billing is the only obstacle that I enjoy solving due to the fact that insurance policies are always changing every year. Management is great, however I do wish that there were more hours for the technicians."
good,"Its a job, immediate management are decent people but the company doesn't care about employees. Pay and benefits are just below average but not terrible."
good,"I worked 10 hour overnight shifts a few times a week. The regional manager would occasionally remember if I asked for time off for finals, which caused me to have to call on sick. The break room was disgusting. The managers and my coworkers were cool."
good,Position was not was as described on line when I applied.  Training for position came 2 months later; All employees were disgruntled in some way and many had either quit or were quitting when I arrived.
good,"Excellent co workers and an easy going atmosphere.  The facility is state of the art, the recreational areas and cafeteria are excellent.  CVS is a very large company however, and at the micro level it can be difficult to give any input due to their financial approval processes and policies."
good,"stores pay roll is always tight,,,,, always working with the minimal amount of people. since its only two people at the store ,you dont get the proper training to advance ,,,"
good,"The Woonsocket  R. I. warehouse location  is where I was employed. You have someone with you training  you for the first three months to see if you can handle the fast paced environment.After my training was over I had a supervisor come up to me and say "" I'm here to watch you because you are not meeting the required #'s /% that is needed. This is when I turned in my badge to the H.R. . I had been a picker packer for the previous 4+yrs and I knew my speed and ability. When the supervisor approached me and said what she said I knew the company was not a good fit for me."
good,"It is a good job, but there are not enough employees for all the work load. The company has good benefits and a good culture but with all the work load sometimes it's hard to manage time."
good,Nothing keeps me more stressed than having more work added onto our already busy schedules at the same time our hours are repeatedly cut. Increasing that bottom line for everyone else but us at the bottom getting eaten alive. Our job is the reason corporate exists in this company but being treated as so isnt ever happening
good,"Very customer based company. Typical day was working out product.Working in damaged products, assisting customers.Every employee is cashier trained and able to open a checkout."
good,The retail setting allows me to have direct contact with not only prescribers but also patients. It is quite an ideal setting to stay up to date with new drugs in the market and policies.
good,No real training for the areas you assigned Too much nitpicking such as where to park in the parking lot and there no hoodie  policy and no sense of direction overall a real laid back job
good,"Solid 8 hour job with benefits available. Depending on location, work flow can either be lax or hectic. In the case of the latter, a solid team will manage."
good,"Don't take this review as a point of view from an official CVS employee. It was only work experience from a job agency. My advice is to get a watch or have patience, because you could be turned down for cellphone use."
good,"CVS/pharmacy has a fast paced environment with increasing number of demands of employees.  The culture is not patient centered, but business and number centered."
good,"I worked for CVS for 3 years and didn't call out for almost my entire time working there, as soon as i did they treated me like I wronged them and wouldn't let it go. Overall, I did really expand my resume with this job. If you work here be prepared for a list of work that's the same every week. But wouldn't recommend it as a long term job."
good,"Overall, had it's ups and downs that were predominantly affected by your geographic region.  Initially the stores were staffed well in the early 2000's and then changed over time.  It was more difficult to meet goals with more technician turnover and less hours.  The quality of the supervisor and district managers vary from region to region and define the success and happiness of the organization in different locations."
good,"calm, relaxed, slow paced, recommend for highschool or college students to earn some extra cash. Management was good, hardest part of the job was the customers and shoplifters."
good,"make time for yourself first, because they will require all of you, never stop doing your best and remember you can do it no matter how crazy the job or the patients are"
good,Some time the job is very hard waiting on customer taking care of them sometime customer is not nice but been in retail so long I learn customer come first I go a extra mile to be sure they are well taking care I have a lot patience I love my job
good,"CVS was fast-paced working environment. I don't remember a lot of details because it was over 20+ years ago that I worked for them. sorry, can't remember."
good,It definitely had job security. The lack of pay sucked. They did a fair market survey and anyone that was below the rate was bumped up to that amount but they did not take into account how long you had been. When new employees were being paid the fair market amount so were employees that had been there for a couple years that were bumped up to that amount. That's not fair but they didn't seem to care. Overtime was mandatory every year at the beginning of the year. They had great benefits and lots of PTO.
good,"This store is a very busy store. Work as a team to get the job done.  Depending on the pharmacist, as to who can motivate people. Some are really good others do not care."
good,"Very few good store managers, most can't handle the stresses of  the workforce and employees. Only upside is you make friends with co workers and hate to see people leave."
good,"I usually work between 8 and 10 hrs a day on a computer. There is room for advancement, but only if the management like you. Overtime, hard work, effort, seniority, none of that matters. Its all who they want. It is a diverse work culture for the most part, but in my particular department, not many minorities had a chance to get promoted. Hardest part of my job was knowing that my hard work was never going to pay off when all I wanted was to advance and do well to provide for my family"
good,I started as a cashier then advanced to the pharmacy. I enjoyed my job and customers but not so much other employees because sometimes the new person just isnt liked
good,CVS was an overall place to work. I was quite pleased with my work schedule and medical benefits. CVS also offered some for advancement and had opportunities for relocation.
good,"Going into this I had previous experience at places like CVS. However, I feel I was not trained well enough to complete what was needed of me from the staff. I was sort of just thrown into it all without really doing anything other than computer work that was a pain in the butt. I understand they want you to do the things so you can learn but in such a fast paced setting, like a pharmacy, you should let them breathe for a minute. I was doing shifts both in the front store as well as the pharmacy. It was challenging for me to process everything I had been taught because I was not consistently working in one of those areas. At times it has been a week between shifts in an area, which staff didn’t seem to understand. There was only another coworker and I that were tasked with working in every part of the store. The store manager is extremely passionate and takes a lot of pride in his work and staff. He was very understanding with me and took the time to discuss with me why this didn’t end of being the right fit for me. The pharmacy team is fine, but sometimes can come across harsh when under stressful situations, which is extremely common. The staff up front is great other than one manager that has a very condescending attitude and thinks that they are so amazing and talked down to me constantly. I think this job is best for someone with pharmacy and retail experience that doesn’t mind literally yelling hello to customers the second they walk in."
good,"lovely group of staff members.We were a team,our only aim was to satisfy the patient.The hours were too few though but we had each others  back.It was great experience but my priorities have shifted and i look forward to any exciting endeavor that may come my way."
good,great place to work. stressful at times but manageable.cvs definitely gives you the right tools to do your job. lots of opportunities . i wish they offered better health plans .
good,"it can be very challenging, they are very unforgiving for life's everyday occurrences, and want our lives to revolve around them...  never complimented on what a good job has been done, the focus is always on what could have been done better with less staff and time..  usually proximal staff is amazing!"
good,"Low pay and a culture of overworking pharmacy technician employees. Pharmacy are not given enough employee hours to allocate among there staff. As a result, technicians are overworked, pharmacies are disorganized/mismanaged, and patient care/prescriptions are effected. They care more about profit than patient care/employees. Good to use as a stepping stone, but I would not recommend a career with this company as a pharmacy technician."
good,Leadership not very organized - and mid-level supervisor or not open to suggestions or discussion. Not really room for advancement.Leadership was basically run by favoritism.
good,"Fairly strict schedule.  However, it was hard to keep good technicians because they could earn more money elsewhere.  Good RPH salary and profit-sharing."
good,"Long work days, I learned a lot about health care and pharmaceutical services.. I've acquired a much appreciated knowledge about insurance.  I met a lot of nice people on the phone and in person."
good,My only problem with CVS was my staff. I was not liked for no reason and basically bullied by a woman who has most likely 20 more years of age on me. Also the manager didn't really want to work with my school schedule. Other than that the job is very relaxed and the hours are good.
good,"Working at CVS for three years now has had its ups and downs. I have learned a lot about drugs and how certain medications affects our bodies. I know how to handle customer situations like insurance and doctor offices. This job has given me the opportunity to go back to school in the medical field. However, there is poor team work in the pharmacy. There has been many days where I work the job of 2 people even though we have more than one person working. Management does not seem to care about my complaints to improve the pharmacy. It can be frustrating to want to be a great team player but no one is helping."
good,Good benefits and good pay. Very strict environment to work in which can be stressful being micromanaged if youre not used to that type of environment it is not the place for you.
good,CVS is not meant to be a long term position unless your a re a pharmacist and in that case it is not bad.  As a tech you will learn a lot which will help you toward your career goals.
good,"Iit was a good experience moving forward. It taught me to how to hustle in what might be considered unfavorable conditions, and get the job done accordingly, with flying colors."
good,"I was personally part of the Target Pharmacy staff before it was merged with CVS.  The job involved helping customers, filling prescriptions, assisting pharmacists and tons of miscellaneous work.  The staff I personally worked with was fantastic; we were practically a family away from home.  There were tons of opportunities to learn and the job had a new surprise almost every day.  While direct, in-store management was fine, the company management was very poor.  Our district manager was completely unhelpful and unresponsive to our store's needs.  Hours for both pharmacists and technicians were very low with CVS, resulting in many days where the store was under-staffed.  This could create extremely chaotic, stress-filled days; this stress was my ultimate reason for leaving.  Ultimately, I think CVS is a fine job with a good atmosphere and job duties that needs better management and increased staff hours."
good,"•	Lead personnel in inspecting, loading and shipping of thousands of cargo and personnel parachutes over a 4-month period. "
good,"The CVS that I work at used to be a Target Pharmacy and I honestly wish it still was.  Target management was friendlier and much more helpful than CVS management.  We hardly ever see the big guys.  Target Pharmacy guaranteed a lot more hours, even for part-time employees, but ever since we went to CVS, hours for all employees have plummeted."
good,Cvs aquired Omnicare LTC pharamcy and they are in over their head.  We are no longer allowed to give our customers the customer service that they deserve. It is very frustrating the limitations we have been given since the acquistion.
good,CVS was willing to give me my first pharmacy technician job. I really enjoyed the work and the patients but after a couple years I decided to no longer pursue pharmacy at all.
good,"CVS was a good job to have, but just not with my schedule. It would be a good job for someone who was wanting a full time job and is okay with working in a fast paced environment"
good,CVS pays about what you would expect for its management positions but hourly employees usually make about 10 percent less then the industry standards.  There is potential for advancement however I have not been impressed with the leadership skills of much of the management within the company.
good,"Upper level management is consistently increasing the amount of work required and target levels for metrics while cutting hours more and more every week leaving the techs and pharmacists struggling, then griping them out when the unreasonable expectations are not met, salary is stagnant with meager raises annually."
good,Pleasant work environment. Flexible schedule. Not much room for growth. Great customer service. wish there was security available for safety purposes ...
good,"working at cvs caremark was interesting. i enjoyed the people i worked with, i did not enjoy the schedule raffle. the pay and benefits were really good though."
good,"Managers were either fired, quit, or moved to other location fairly often. Store was understaffed. Work load was high. Paid pretty well, but expectations were not realistic."
good,I worked at 2 different CVS Pharmacies and neither one could seem to hang on to a manager and the ones that did stay were miserable and overworked. There was never enough coverage.
good,"in a.c a lot of talking to others"
good,I actually enjoyed my job but if I had to work in other areas it would be very stressful. They make you work a lot more hours then they tell you. Management is extremely rude.
good,"I work at a very busy location in lower Manhattan, the store is extremely busy all the time. One of the things i enjoyed the most was the diversity, both with employees and customer being able to interact with people from different culture was a bonus for me. However, store management was not the best, i was lucky to experience 2 store manager. my first store manager really took time to develop employee and bring out their true potential, he did spend sometime with me during my role as a supervisor to help me grow and learn the business. This motivated me and made me lean toward future advancing in the company, being that i already had a bachelors degree, i taught this was the company to go all the way."
good,Working in the pharmacy is very fast paced. The most difficult part of the job was to balance personal patient care while trying to keep pace with the work load. Pharmacy management was excellent. I was privileged to work with one of  the best pharmacists around. I learned a lot about different kinds of medications and their functions. It was enjoyable to see friendly regular faces come in that appreciated our staff assisting them. A typical day was very steady to extremely busy. There was rarely a slow day.
good,"It's not a bad part-time job for someone who is interested in becoming a pharmacist, even if only to find out you don't want to get into retail pharmacy. Experience can vary depending on which pharmacy you're at and which pharmacist is working. Some make your job more difficult, others make it easier."
good,"Call center was ok, management and the lack of policies in place made it very difficult to do your job properly. The systems that were used need to be updated in order to provide PSRs with better tools. Customers were often upset due to the lack of abilities that PSRs had  to complete their jobs."
good,A typical day includes a lot of patient counselling by pharmacists.  I learned about how to communicate with people whose first languages are not English.
good,CVS is a good company to work for. The company promotes from within which is good for someone who wans to more forward with the company. Having a fair Store Manager and a DM that will fight for what's right really makes a huge difference. We have to go to other stores for hours that our home store can't offer.
good,"A good place to work with the right leadership, but not if you are outspoken.  Sometimes it tends to be taken in the wrong manner.  It's great if you just keep your head down and work and never really question things."
good,"Overall, CVS was a good company to work for. The main downfalls were being short staffed all the time and lack of concern from management in those situations."
good,"During my time at the company I was the youngest manager in training, which brought on my issues.I had staff disrespect me due to them being older than me. I had fellow managers in training constantly try to be super manipulative. My boss was never there to train me or listen to my concerns, but those were just a few bad apples in the bunch. However, my overall experience was goo due to the employees and the experience and training I received. I had many employees quit after I left (many college students) because of the lack of rapport between employees and management"
good,I have been here for 6 years and honestly the only way to move up and advance my career is if one of the long time supervisors decided up and and change careers. There are so little job titles that you are stuck doing one thing and one thing only.
good,"Your hours will vary store to store, manager to manager.  I had to work 50 hours a week and go to school, so it was definitely tough.  If you get this as a first time job, its a great experience and will teach you valuable lessons.  However, your pay is not proportionate to your performance, you will do way more than what you earn."
good,"Working for CVS is alright, the pay is great and there are some great opportunities. The metrics aspect of this can be very challenging among everything else a pharmacist has to do. Overall its an okay company to work for."
good,"The job was plentiful with opportunities to advanced. They treated the employee great with food when open enrollment came, and little games to earn extra money. But on the week to week basis, it was hard to maintain bills plus gas money, or bus passes."
good,"Was a college job to pull me through. Location I worked at was constantly changing due to high volume and turn over. Overall, not a bad place to work just kind of stressful given I had a full course load to match."
good,"Overall, good company to work for but in my field, there was no room to advance. I left because of work injury and I was not fixed 100% due to lack of treatment from workers comp. I was not able to go back to my job and continue working. The company also eliminated the Beauty Department Manager role and offered me role that was less then what I had and could not promise that I would keep my current pay."
good,"large work load, busy all day and night, customer service is #1 and I loved working there , Staff was always friendly and caring  to your needs and concerns."
good,"Cvs is a good place to work in the pharmacy industry. However, I did find that they are extremely understaff and put a lot of presssure on the pharmacist."
good,"I worked for the company for a long time, and my direct supervisor  was very effective. The stores run well, but pharmacists are given increasingly more to do. Overall, employees are overworked and understaffed which decreases morale and increases the risk for medication safety errors."
good,The hardest part of the job is completing all the tasks with limited time to actually complete it. The company has limited budget to work with and sometimes it may not be enough to complete all the task there is for the day and week.
good,Well I was only for for about a year.  II moved to another city for school.  So the opportunities that I might of had I didn't have an chance for experience.At that company.
good,I started my Human Resources career at CVS.  I started with payroll and then proceeded to learn all functions of the position.  I enjoyed the work I did.  After a few months they added the safety and workers compensation aspects to my position.
good,"Every pharmacy is run a bit differently. A good or bad experience is based on who is leading your team. Fortunately, I work with a pharmacy manager with high expectations and good attitude."
good,"A typical day at work, would be putting data into the system filing and typing customer prescriptions into the system. Walking files over to proper department"
good,It was a  very stressful job. We filled over 400 prescriptions a day and did not have any employees. The manager od the pharmacy was not fair at treating all employess equal.
good,"- Fill about 200 prescriptions"
good,"There are down times where you do busy work such as process returns, damages and stolen items. Every week, there are price changes to put up and nearly every week you will be putting up warehouse. The down side, in a nutshell, is that some management is lazy, the hours can be random and not stable, and customers complain a lot about the sales prices and coupons. Again, its pretty average like most retail. If you're already in retail and plan to stay, it does offer better growth opportunities."
good,"Typical workday entailed prescription data entry, billing insurance, filling prescriptions, answering phone calls from patients and drs and under the pharmacist, providing patient counseling"
good,This was my first call-center environment so I truly can't compare to others but the management at CVS Health isn't warm or open to suggestions. Training is definitely lacking as well. We were taught the basics and thrown into the lions den in a sense. I asked for more training on multiple occasions but time away from phones just isn't available.
good,good place to start right out of pharmacy tech program. You can also train under a pharmacist and obtain PT license without going to school. but this can take long
good,"Clock in move pills. Help customers with prescriptions and checkout, answer phones, check insurance, file, clean work space. Organize bottles of medication."
good,"The company tend to reduce hours and increase work load therefore creating stressful work environment. At the end of the day , i am totally drain both physically and mentally."
good,Good company with good benefits and salary. Upper management was not supportive or loyal to their employees. Communication between upper management and employees was non existent.
good,It was ok working there for a while. Not conducive to forming friendships with your co employees  as there are not much socialization in the factory set up workplace. Great medical benefits though.
good,"This was a temporary job for me and I worked as a cashier while in school. The management had strange rules and corporate would come in to check in every so often, which they all seemed very stressed out about every time. I applied during the time that CVS took out all of their tobacco products, which I think is awesome and made me want to work there. I didn't like that I had to be on my feet at all times and was required to both walk around the store and man the register at all times, which meant I had to run back and forth a lot. Not for me, but not a terrible company."
good,"I really enjoy working with people who have common goals and want to aid the improvement of the quality of life of others. Working together to make sure people have the life saving and life changing medication they need, is very rewarding."
good,"I quit my job for CVS. Biggest regret. They hire people left and right and get rid of people left and right. This job is VERY intense, cutthroat, and stressful. Very very stressful. They are very strict on percentages and accuracy. I am now in a hardship because they made me believe this job was a peice of cake."
good,"i work from home."
good,"a typical work start time can range within a 5 hour window depending upon your shift."
good,"It all depends on who you work with and their work ethic. This place literally made me dislike retail pharmacy work.  Corporate can make it hard for you to effectively do your job. God forbid you work with a lazy crew, you will have customers yelling all day, and that in itself makes you tired and over it. A good pharmacy manager that knows where to put people and when also helps."
good,"CVS is a decent company to work for. They try to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to new food, new makeup, and new advancements in retail and pharmacy. The problem is they try to cut the front retail store on hours, people, and benefits."
good,"Sometimes expectations were unreachable with the budget given for scheduling. Extremely stressful, physically and mentally demanding. Management doesn't always stick together when problems arise."
good,"Company is more about numbers than patients and long term employees. They do not value their employees who have given them over 20 year.s of service, not even offering other job opportunities"
good,Went from being a contractor to being hired with CVS to being hired at Aetna.    CVS and Aetna were both a business casual environment.   I like that.
good,"This was a good opportunity in the beginning of my career with the organization. I was able to leverage my past experience and I learned a lot. During my early years the organization service focuse was providing the best in class.  However, as the organization grew employees were overwhelmed and overloaded with work which caused a stressful environment which resulted in subpar service and many mistakes throughout the organization."
good,I enjoyed working with the people there and enjoyed getting to know and working with the nurses at the nursing homes. I don't think it was fair the way I got laid off. I went on 3rd shift 10 years ago to help the company but was never told I would lose my seniority.
good,If you enjoy running around and multitasking then this is the place to be. Overall good experience just lack of appreciation and pay.. When new hires are making more then senior staff that's a problem
good,I loved my coworkers as well as the work environment. My only complaint would be that there was a lack of communication and mutual understanding. I would still recommend someone to work at CVS.
good,"Very high prescription volumes in most stores, not nearly enough tech help during the busiest seasons. The pay is good, and for the most part we aren't micro-managed."
good,"CVS was not a bad place to work, professional setting, however the pay rate was discouraging. Unfortunately you can hand out burgers or life saving medication and get paid the same rate."
good,"busy, managing all the tasks by myself. no technicains hours provided. every step is graded, and micromanaged by the management. and by working by myself soemtimes i am not able to fullfill the requiremetns"
good,In General CVS was a great place to work. I loved the people that I worked with and they liked me. I was pretty talkative and I always got my job done. Management really needed to learn to be a little more real and more laid back. not so mean to others. and not selective to whom they were friends with. They would be really social to certain one. it was really difficult to deal with.
good,"CVS is a large company that offers many great benefits to their employees such as 401K, health insurance, discount and paid vacation after 6 months of employment. The work environment is fast paced and often very stressful. also, there seems to always be an issue with underemployment."
good,"Pros"
good,Can be very overwhelming at first but really depends on the store and your team. It can be good/bad depending on the store. I would recommend it if you have no other options
good,"I absolutely enjoy and love what I do. Being in healthcare is very rewarding. However, I think the demands and workload that is placed upon you is very unreasonable. Corporate wants numbers and expects you to deliver at any cost. I feel sometimes those costs are high. Causing mental anguish, stress, and sometimes health scares. Finding a balance is key to survival in a sometimes chaotic environment. And, I believe I have mastered this."
good,"A typical day at CVS:"
good,Corporate office did not pay the lower end  employees enough income for their high stressful daily work load.High expectations for low pay and Corporate often forgot employees for yearly pay raises but gave higher end position roles high yearly bonuses.
good,"A typical day was taking inbound calls to verify benefits . The management was able to give information when needed. There was free lunch, OT, floating holidays."
good,"I enjoyed working at CVS but it was time to move forward. The work wasn't hard and they offered great benefits, but I wasn't paid based on my experience or education. This job is great, but I need more to make a living."
good,"A typical day included visiting multiple stores and assessing and assisting with loss prevention and theft prevention. As a loss prevention associate we would attempt to apprehend and deter suspected shoplifters at these locations, "
good,"I've been here less than half a year, the employess are nice to work with but there is a major lack of communication with management to employee. The work is not hard, but they lack in training employees."
good,I worked for CVS for 4 to 5 years. I left because I graduated college and found employment elsewhere. I still worked for CVS for a while but i could never give them the desired hours.
good,n/a my manager is very good..fast paced......ok pay....like my co-workers......pretty good employee discount....some over time ....work 40 hours a week and maybe a saturday ever once in awhile!
good,"maintain 9 miles of conveyor in building.. worked on sorter, garage doors, changed batteries on fork trucks.. enjoyed doing what it took to keep things running.."
good,"Since working at CVS, I have achieved many skills associated with cash handling, conducting reports, retail items, customer service, and the opportunity to grow within the company."
good,"Answering​ ​telephones,​ ​typing​ ​new​ ​prescriptions,​ ​filling​ ​existing​ ​prescriptions,​ ​counting​ ​and"
good,"Customers Service is number one."
good,"As with any job,it can be very stressful at times. There is not really a typical day because there are so many factors that cause it not to be.It is a very stressful environment and sometimes co-workers will take it out on you."
good,I think CVS is an exceptional place to work its just that when your coworkers get a negative attitude it brings the rest of the team down and you suffer set backs. I think that with the right team leader keeping everyone level headed you can essentially solve any task and keep everyone smooth sailing. Typically everyone would get very frustrated easily and ruin the entire attack plan for the day. As well as many people on their phone all the time and constant bullshitting around instead of actively taking care of the customers and making sure everything gets done. My mentality is while at work your focus should be 100% there  and everything else second and for some people that was vice versa which really caused me to ultimately quit as well as the overall treatment I received.
good,It would have been fine if the Company would invest in a shuttle Bus for their employees! I worked there for a week and the distance wasn't easy. I stood at Rosemont and watch Shuttles come and pick up their employees.
good,It's an okay job needs more people to work in the front  of the store. It can be overwhelming at times it's also a low job at times but we do get a lot of women who do  coupon you will have to watch out.
good,"high turnover due to lack of work life balance. People friendly and although their hands are tired, management seems to care about you as a worker. They need to improve on workplace cleanliness"
good,"Working for CVS is not so terrible depending on the pharmacy team. Even on the busiest days, it is not so bad if the pharmacist is very proactive and technicians know what to do and most importantly, do their tasks correctly. There is not enough help and that can add extra stress and pressure."
good,"First job out of school, typical day at work in answering calls, I was working in the HelpDesk department. Learning a lot about desktops and application. Management made lots of promises. The hardest part of the job was resetting end users password, too many applications that needs password reset."
good,"I loved working for Target pharmacy, I signed on in 2014. In 2015 they were bought out by CVS. This job has provided me with a lot of opportunities and flexibility but I believe that is directly related to my managers style and ability to manage well. She and me team are what have kept me on at CVS."
good,The particular CVS I worked at was understaffed and very fast paced.  A lot of safety concerns for employees.  Pay did not match for the job I was performing
good,"paid hour is low salary and is stressful to support your living and family lifestyles. Health benefit is affordable, it is friendly people are depends."
good,CVS is a very competitive work environment with an unusual work flow that does not always allow for optimal efficiency in a high paced environment. Incredible staff and attitudes but some question with respect to work flow
good,"The company is close to home and fairly low stress.  I sort prescriptions, routing them to the appropriate hub.  The people are nice, and the desks are comfortable.  During times of high volume, management passes out goodies to help keep us going.  Our section has monthly potluck lunches."
good,"I love my job and the people i work with, dont get me wrong. but with the pay im getting, i could be working at walmart. The company itself is just cheap when it comes to their employees"
good,The store that I work at is extremely busy. The problem is that we are always short staff all the time. The salary sucks. I can barely afford a decent place to live for me and my daughter on my salary.
good,The manager treats his employees like trash. Some of the employee are very rude. It is a very hostile work environment. They would rather talk to you like a child then an equal. The cashiers are told they are just cashiers and not important.
good,Expectations are high with some to little reward/benefit aside from medical/prescription benefits (if full time) The atmosphere is very busy but can be fun with a good team.
good,A normal day at this employer consists of certain stretches of time where it's a relatively slow-paced and relaxed environment while other times are insanely busy with non-stop customers and orders stacked everywhere they'll fit. The management was not unpleasant to work for.  In my experience they treated everyone equally and fairly without any biases or favoritism shown towards any individual or group of employees.
good,I learned a great deal of experience at CVS. The other employees are very friendly and great to get along with. The store I worked at was the busiest store in NJ so we are a fast paced 24 hour pharmacy.
good,great enviroment especially for newly graduate pharmacist. Good benifit package and place for advancement and recognition. I did enjoy working there and would recommend it. structruced and experienced company.
good,Allowed everyone to work one day from home a week. 40 hour work weeks. Typical day at work is not overly stressful everyone pretty much comes in and gets there work done and goes home. Hardest part of the job is actually understanding what and how you complete your work. There ere times where I was expected to know how to do something when management knew I had no prior experience.
good,Over the years I been working on customer service every place is diffenert.You meet people that become more then customers more like family. Had fun working there
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is to satisfy our customers, to bring back their health, happiness by listening and counseling them. I wish the management is better and generous to support the pharmacists."
good,Bad job manager is a place of stress long hours. Manager is a bad person no respect for other she wants you to do all the job for her. She does not know the work.
good,"This was a traveling job where we went and register citizen to take a various of tests like blood pressure,glucose,blood desitency,weight,and offer Cabs Caremark cards."
good,"you have to be willing to deal with the high demand work load in a face paced environment, dealing with patient care.  If that is something you can handle this is a great place to work"
good,I feel like the customers don't come first! We need a better system when it comes to helping our patients. Where's the heart in CVS???? You will never get 40 hours a week and the pay isn't enough for your grocery bill.
good,"Most days it is crazy busy in the pharmacy, but I love the moments when I get to catch up with what is going on in the lives of our regulars. I have learned a lot about medications such as the brands and their generics, what they are used for and certain things you need to do when taking certain medications. (i.e. taking medication with food or not drinking while taking certain medications) I do wish we were provided with more tech hours especially because CVS is all about help our customers finding a better path to health and treating them with the utmost care. We need more hours to be able to provide the best customer service and I feel like it falls short sometimes when we aren't appropriately staffed."
good,CVS does not provide enough pharmacy support .  Pharmacist training need to be improved and more support from management.  I would like to return to CVS to see if things have improved.
good,I love the diversity especially at the LSU location. The only thing that at night it is really dangerous without security. The bad part is that the pay is low and there is no room for advancement.
good,"CVS is a good company to work for. While I believe the management is lacking in certain aspects, the customers I have gotten the privilege to help have been amazing. They have helped make my work days more positive during each and every shift. There are places to move up in the company, but you have to want to take on those jobs. They are not good opportunities for everyone. The job is very fast paced and can be very taxing and stressful making it difficult to see it as a lifetime career choice."
good,A very fast paced job so you don't have the time to really train like you're supposed to. Once you get the hang of things you're well on your way. Counting medications are the best part.
good,CVSHealth is great if you network well and really enjoy office politics. Although the exposure for advancement is there the bureaucracy will drag things to a standstill.
good,The hours are good but the training for the position needs updating. As a new hire in my department I was not trained well. Also rules implemented by the lead tech are not executed when he is not there. The work is very easy but it is time consuming. While when I joined the company it was in the middle of being changed from one company to another. There are opportunities for advancement just let your manager know. My manager really wants his employees to get along with one another and works hard at trying to find you a place in the company that will make you happy. I would just recommend telling your manager about anything that is confusing so that it can be documented and changed. This company has the potential to be a great place to work but currently it is just okay but I am grateful for the opportunity so far and look forward to my future in the workforce.
good,begin day by logging in;checking emails ;prescription refills and doctor calls.i learned how to deal with different characters.the hardest part was making sure you convinced everyone to pick up their scrpts.enjoyable part was I enjoy my profession with a passion to serve.
good,Conditions de travail physiquement et mentalement stressantes
good,"Cvs is a fast paced working environment, they tend to get by with making us do more work and giving us less hours so the work portion and employee portion was off balance. They did treat me well when it came to pay and benefits but I do not agree with breaks and certain pharmacists."
good,My typical day at work was pretty simple. At the job i had to assist patients that would come and pick up their prescribed medicine.  Overall the job is manageable.
good,Internship required you to work a minimum of 20 hours per week.  Definitely need more staff pharmacists or hours per shift. Probably the most stressful environment I've been at.
good,"Has good and bad attributes like any other company, good employees to work with. Lots of work to do, but has pretty good pay and good benefits. Like working there."
good,"the basic job is take all calls with intakes, or schedule new orders, order status. the hard part is stay 2-3 hours continue just taking calls. No new challenges. the hardest part is the distance to drive."
good,"Productive enjoyed working there, a challenging and robust working environment.  Great learning experience, great team members because of the constant changes made to the system gave me an opportunity to learn a great wealth of knowledge about the SDLC and it's methodology. The hardest part of the job was the number of releases and the quick turn around of deadlines."
good,"I was a relief pharmacist. I traveled to different locations almost daily."
good,Very good company to work for. Great location. Should have consistency within departments as to how many work from home days are allowed. Very fair work/life balance.
good,"Never a dull moment in the retail pharmacy world. The work is fast paced and can be stressful. But, the work culture is positive. Management works in tandem with techs, there is opportunity for professional growth, development and advancement."
good,its an ok job. minimum wage. i love how CVS values its customers and how important customer service is. the hardest part about this job is dealing with angry customers and dealing with employees who do not do their job well.
good,"The company was not horrible, I enjoyed working there, I struggled with a work/ life balance. The team was new and it was difficult to come together as a team."
good,The environment is very fast paced and must be able to multitask.  I really enjoy the people I work with and have gained valuable experience here.  The direct management is very supportive and motivating.
good,"100- or more calls a day , incoming . great schedule ,overtime optional off on weekends support from sups are not the greatest but overall great benefits"
good,"general pharmacy technician duties, providing customer service to patients. assist patients pick up and drop of prescriptions. The pharmacy manager and the store manager both are great leaders."
good,"Working at CVS Health has been a worthwhile experience and has helped me grow as a professional. The leadership has empowered me to take charge in my roles and in my career development. My confidence has grown, and I feel I have become a valuable member  of the organization thanks to the teams I have been a part of."
good,"The customer service at CVS was not what it should have been, the pharmacy was so busy and the employees were overwhelmed the customers suffered for that."
good,If you're looking for a job that's not as stressful then CVS is a place for you. Just keep customers smiling and help them. You might be dependable if you keep up the good work :)
good,"Working at CVS is a great way for anyone looking to START their careers in the pharmaceutical industry.  They train you for 6 months, and even pay to have you certified for State requirements for the first 2 years.  It can get hectic at times, and you MUST have patience with some customers.  the hardest part of the job would be the lack of help CVS has in its workplace.  Our higher ups do not give enough hours to accommodate the rushes of people some days, and that could cost employees breaks.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be the coworker interaction, because my coworkers are roughly around the same age as I am, we all get along, and it's nice to have friends in your workplace."
good,easy to move up. The company has a high deductible health plan. Its hard to meet the deductible. Even when you are sick with a doctor note u still get in trouble. You do receive a lot of PTO if you can get the time off.
good,"Not the worst professional experience I have ever had but not the best either. When the people who are given authority to train and to discipline are half your age and you are outnumbered it becomes difficult to reason with people who have much less professional and life experience. There is also a clique mentality where the rules do not apply to other people. I cannot say I have not learned a lot . I have , however, the environment there is not conducive to really learning your profession. If I did not like working with people, I would not have stayed here. Unfortunately, this particular retail setting, it becomes less about healthcare and more about quotas and personal favoritism.You don't always feel appreciated. There is a lot of disconnect between management and corporate and this can be damaging to not only work flow but to the employees."
good,"community pharmacy at its best, management is great, I have learned that I am looking to get out of community pharmacy. After working for several different companies, I have found I like CVS the best"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was that i was able to assist in helping others by providing the proper therapy medicines. Helping others on their journey to better health.
good,"Typical day answering calls taking patient payment."
good,"A typical day depends on the time of the year. More stressful in the winter time. Some things I've learned here was inventory control, and perfecting data entry and analyst skills. Of course, other skills like customer service, HIPPA, extreme attention to detail are required. There is hardly any room for advancement, and if there is, the extra work is not worth the pay. A great thing about CVS is the workplace culture. They hire people from all kinds of cultural backgrounds, race, gender, orientation, religion etc. Buy comfortable shoes, as you will be on your feet all day."
good,"My review may not be as well as other, but I was working as a pharmacy technician in a 24 hour pharmacy in an area known for having a drug problem. I am confident in my ability to handle things that come my way, but it became very stressful being short staffed the entire time I worked there and needing to stay after my time off every shift because it was so busy."
good,Easy job. Just requires patience.  management plays favorites. If youre looking for a job for just a couple months its okay but I would not recommend for a long term job.
good,cvs is a demanding company with high expectations of their employees. they train you and constantly have new modules for you to do but there is not much room for advancment
good,typical fast pace job hard work easy to grow if determined great discounts short breaks. alot of customer service busy days alot of sales and coupons.
good,"Pharmacy technicians work with pharmacists to help prepare and give out prescription medication. Working in pharmacies and hospitals, pharmacy techs do a lot behind the counter. They take prescriptions over the phone and in person, work with health professionals and customers, help mix medicines, count pills, measure medication, label and give instructions for medicine, and help take payments. Pharmacy techs are the liaison between the public and pharmacists, helping set up consultations and recommendations."
good,8 hour shift job limited time for personal life. Management is not supportive or ever around. Job is confusing with no clear instructions or organization. It's a well diverse place with different races.
good,"Training for new hires are appropriate"
good,"The job wasn't the worst job to have while attending college, but it was definitely not the easiest. The job is very fast paced and there was a lot of turnover in a short amount of time."
good,"Interpretation and inputting prescriptions, Pulling and filling prescriptions per the written prescriptions. Cycle counting and out of stocking medications."
good,"Working for CVS Health as a technician is very unpredictable, some days are busier than others. There is not much job advancement unless you're going to pharmacy school."
good,"If job security is a priority CVS Health provides that. Its a very fast paced environment tat provides good oppurtunity. But beware, all pharmacy's are understaffed with under paid unskilled techs that make many mistakes."
good,"Compensation is competitive.  Only downfall is work/life balance.  High turnover rate.  NP's need to cover 2 on call shifts/month and work every other weekend.  Expect to be called in on on-call days.  NP's are responsible for secretary, nurse, management, and NP duties with no help while seeing 20-30+ patients/day.  Can cause for a stressful day."
good,The hardest part of my job is dealing with stubborn customers and it helps to be apart of a decent team. My tip is to put some effort into teamwork. Its more rewarding.
good,"Scan medications, customer service, answer phone calls, return medications, call different facilities. Ship/stat out  medications with the correct manifests."
good,Good place to work. Employee are nice. Great place to make money. Great benefits. Hard to get time off. Work hours for the most part are good. Paid time off and paid holidays
good,"Daily filling of prescriptions at a moderate to high volume store, can be stressful if you are short staffed or staff isnt trained well, high technician turnover rate.  A lot of success is based on scores achieved through various activities, patient refill phone calls, how fast scripts are typed, produced and checked and on time inventory management."
good,Nice place to work.  Everyone was real nice.  Very busy store and customers can be very rude.  Just have to suck it up and do your job.  Manager was nice.
good,"When I worked at Coram, the company had just completed a merger with Caremark. The environment was hostile and it was very hard to manage. I managed to take a good control of the staff and make sure that the staff was offering a good quality of work."
good,CVS Caremark is a very large company. The Specialty division came a long way after CVS corporation efforts to invest in the division. There was a bit of disorganization since the company was so large and there was always too many people involved for each project.
good,"Unload the truck "
good,"There is room to advance,but it takes a long time because we seem to always short of staff. I think if upper management were more organized this problem could be easily solved."
good,"The mid management was sub par but, upper management was great.  It was tough talking to people who are hurting all the time.  The pay wan't very good but, one good thing is we weren't forced to work overtime."
good,Great place to work.  I was a temp.  I wish I was a full time employee.  Pay was lower than I would expect. The hours I had were terrific.  The location was close to home which was another plus.
good,"In the 13 yrs that I was at the CVS DC it has really changed, and not for the better. The pay is not competitive and that is why you have people that have been there for even 10 plus yrs leaving. They can't even keep supervisors. It is very sad. It used to be a job that I looked forward to going to, a place I recommended to friends and family. Not anymore. Sorry, not sorry."
good,"Very stressful, high volume, sometimes unsavory job. They had issues with staffing people constantly. I became very stressed and eventually left my position. There were opportunities for advancement and the pay was very good. The management was good but sometimes lacking in their responsibilities."
good,"Benefits are great, but the stores are insanely busy. There is little tech help. Little time to eat or take a break. Management is focused on cutting payroll to the bone."
good,"CVS is a very fast paced place to manage. Between all of the day to day activities and customer service, a lot is asked of management. One must be able to multi-task or you will not do well in this company. The benefits are really good, even though the health insurance is a bit on the high side. They compensate that by having no co-pay for prescriptions filled at a CVS pharmacy. You are also given a credit card with which to pay your co-pays at the doctor. I feel like there is not enough support at times from district and regional headquarters, but this is due to their high workload as well. All in all, a good place with many advancement opportunities."
good,typical sit down at a computer kinda job. Not much else to say as far as a pharmacy technician position goes.  Mail order work is better than up in the med D dept
good,"-Stressful and understaffed"
good,I enjoyed my work with this company. The staff in the store that I worked in were great. I learned how to lead a team. Corporate should make moving up in the company available to staff equally. As it is staff member has to be willing to relocate in order to move up.
good,I think that when it was longs it was one of my favorite jobs ever. After the change to CVS I wasn't impressed.   The visual of the store was not great nor were many changes.
good,"ambiente estrenaste y de mucha paciencia, personal calificado pero tratar con publico es un trabajo de paciencia y control, es un trabajo muy divertido"
good,"I was only part time for only three months though, I enjoyed working with my pharmacists at the location I was hired at. Everything else at CVS wasn't the best experience."
good,Overall I enjoyed my time at CVS Health. But like many large companies it does feel like you're viewed as just another number in a group of thousands. As a contractor the company seems be more wiling to hire from outside than promote from within. I would still look at opportunities within the organization but wouldn't feel the need to stay if a better opportunity presented itself.
good,Great pay but Management is horrible. they put a lot of pressure on you to maintain accuracy and maintain a performance standard that seems at most times to fluctuate and does not seem to be accurate
good,"Everything about CVS is mediocre. The pay is mediocre, the benefits are mediocre, and the people who work there are mediocre."
good,"Over worked and under paid,cvs is all about numbers and making sure people are coming to get there meds, you have to call parents about everything. Even if they are right in front of you"
good,"I enjoy working at CVS I just want to advance and make more money"
good,"Answering calls, entering prescriptions, billing major credit cards, assisting with copays and copay assistance. Also assisting with open enrollment and customer mail order questions. You are able to learn so much within this company for future endeavors."
good,The transition from Target seemed okay. The CVS system has proven to be a step backwards. There are unnecessary blocks in the system that make workflow inefficient.
good,"Who you know can make you or break you. There is a lot of petty behavior amongst peers and it is easy to get blocked from advancing. However, the opportunities are available if you are well liked."
good,I do not see any room for advancement so far in the company. I do get to meet new people and build relationships and I enjoy that. Not a bad company its just not what I want to do
good,"A typical day at work consists mostly of helping customers and counting pills. The cool part about this job is that you learn something new every day, even after several years! The management team all works together to make sure everything runs smoothly (includes front store and pharmacy). My coworkers definitely make my job better and more fun! The hardest part of being a pharmacy technician is multitasking. Many important things are happening all at once, and you have to be able to keep everything straight."
good,Cvs would be better if the hiring process was simpler and more payroll hours were given. High volume stores are understaffed for the volume done.
good,It was a high theft store and was getting worse so I could not stay there. The staff was friendly and we all got along well. It was a clean and neat store.
good,This job can be rewarding at times because you get to help people but if your co-workers are incompetent then it will be really stressful. The workload is fairly intense depending on the pharmacy's prescription volume. Many pharmacist tend to be arrogant and don't problem solve very well and the customers are entitled for some reason or another. Nevertheless you can learn a lot here and can use what you learned in other fields of medicine.
good,Definitely a job that requires a lot of hard work with tough situations. Customers are brutal. Extremely fast pace environment. Tough job but has made me a better worker overall.
good,The overall job isn't a problem. All the surverys and numbers that the corporate system keep coming up with make it hard to really focus on the important aspects of the job.
good,"A typical day of work would start with incoming phone calls from the start to finish, almost no time in between calls to catch up a break.  Calls are in regard password reset, orders that does not go thru, prescription information that does not shows up on profile, and many curbside orders that does not accept promo code or are not process yet.  Customers could be very rude.  Coworkers and supervisors are very nice to work with but you'll have very little interaction since you are always on the phone.  Training time is minimal- you learn it you do it- little or no time to practice."
good,Enjoyed billing duties; Learned Home Health billing and Drug conversions; Co-workers team players; Management could have been better organized; Best part of the day was doing my job.
good,"Everyone there was very nice, but sometimes it got a little hectic. The most enjoyable part of my job was communicating with the customers. The store manager would not directly tell you when she changed the schedule and then get mad the next day when your late. Also, I am only 16 so they expected me to just run and do some of there job so they did not have to do anything."
good,"You work with a group of people for 8-10 hours a day, that's more waking hours than you spend with your family! Some nosy people like to mind other people's business and start gossip, and that's demoralizing when you're the victim. Most staff work well together, but there are always one or two that seem to be favorites and their errs and lack of teamwork get overlooked. Even if management is making a case against someone, it takes forever to get documented ""proof"", in the meantime moral is suffering for everyone who works so hard.  CVS Healthcare is implementing changes that need to be reviewed because they are not necessarily the right moves for a smaller pharmacy, making the workload even more unbearable for the already overworked technicians.  Need to make DEA and State compliance the everyday norm and not just catch up for audits. Roanoke management is compassionate and caring, and we have a great team of pharmacists and technicians, that's what keeps most of us working."
good,I have enjoyed my time at CVS.  It's a good company to work for if you have the right folks backing you up.  The field is a fun place to be a part of.
good,They need better management. My coworker where great just alot of stress because management was not mature enough to handle his job. They only care about making money not their employees.
good,I like working with public.  The job had a lot of responsibility and fast moving with people at the counter and the phone ringing.
good,"Bill specialty home infusion claims, correct denied claims, credit and re-charge claims due to incorrect pricing        or payer change. Move payments posted in order to correct claims. Create and submit secondary claims. Researched problem payers in order to bill the claim correctly, Audit claims"
good,very productive work setting. excellent benefits. very secure environment. cool rewards when employees reach goals
good,"Over the past two years CVS has lost the majority of their experienced leaders and staff in Medicare Part D and the PBM areas."
good,I loved working at CVS I learned a lot and there is a lot of opportunities to advance with this company. Health insurance and dental provided if qualified as well as overtime hours and pay are always available.
good,Management sucks. Customers are very rude and demanding. Hours were generated by a computer so they would have you working weird shifts. Most of the time we didn't get lunches because we were too busy.
good,"Working at CVS health is like this, you get in and take phone calls. a good patient is someone with no issues. they call and tell you all the info you need and you send their medication to them. The problem patients are the issue. if a patient doesn't have any refills left or needs the insurance to agree to pay for the medication, forget it! you can promise them you'll help but the second you try, management will yell at you ""Auto in to the phones!!"" they are more concerned about numbers then actually helping people. But hey the pay is good and you get asked to do overtime all the time so that's a plus...."
good,"Teaching is a lovely job in small bursts. Theres not really any opportunity for advancement, but the job itself is lovely and the students are often wonderful."
good,"The work is relatively easy once you are trained. however it is the time management balance that is hard. This is because you never know how many and what time customers will show up. also, unforeseen problem with insurances and manufacturers can cause problems."
good,"A typical work day at CVS is extremely busy. There is always so much to do but not enough technicians to do what needs to be done. So of course this means one person is doing the job of what I feel 3 people should be doing. While the phone lines are constantly ringing, customers are coming in picking up and dropping off prescriptions, you are expected to answer the phones, help each customer and make sure the prescriptions are being filled all at the same time. I have honestly learned a lot of information about medicine that I didn't know prior to working at CVS pharmacy. All of the co workers get along very well. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers who are not very nice and very impatient. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the positive vibes that are shared between co workers and our pharmacist."
good,overworked and understaffed most of the time and constantly criticized by managent. would like to feel more appreciated.
good,"Decent pay, too much ot at times,too much pressure to pick at 95% cant make but so many mistakes in 9 mon time frame, want you to start work no later than 3 min after hr. You will be fired for these things. Only certain depts have to comply with these rules."
good,"Busy location with demanding customers."
good,The environment is great the managers that have been there for years is perfect to have but  new here is a director who has came in  who has hired all of her friends and family. room for promotion is now slim due to the fact its about who yo know and not what you know.
good,It was good job to work for while you are going to high-school. Good people and decent culture. You learn a lot about ins and outs of the retail world and customers. A lot of people can learn a lot of respect and appreciation while working in company like this.
good,"I enjoy working here, but there is a need for more organization and a better understanding of the company guidelines and requirements for every individual store."
good,Cvs is a great company to work with. The people i worked with on the floor were great back in the pharmacy were great. but the hours and the management sucked (outside of the store higher up)> i was coming into work only with 2 techs at times due to the company not approving hours.
good,Pretty cool place to work. Its a job. Fast paced. Good entry job. Discount is a plus. Pretty funny sometimes. Writing random words at this point for requirement.
good,"Fast Paced work environment. "
good,"There always something to do in the pharmacy. I get to learn new things everyday, whether it has to do with billing process or learning about drugs. The hardest part of the job is billing medication through insurances. And the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with new patients and learning about different drugs."
good,"I currently manage a 24 hour pharmacy filling over 5,000 prescriptions a week, responsible for 4 full time pharmacists and over 30 technicians."
good,Flexible hours are available for interns to train around their school schedules. Very rewarding to build relationships with patients in the community.
good,Overall very pleased with my employment so far with CVS pharmacy. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a steady job with decent pay.
good,"It is a very stressful job. Less hours so technicians have to work very, very hard to complete any task efficiently. Tiring and dramatic."
good,"Job is ok, just need to raise pay from $9.00 to $12.00 per hour"
good,training was no that good and not long enough either to deal with people medication should have been more extensive. for workers we very nice and helpful all the time. Nashville location needs updated everything still looks like the 70's in the building.
good,"Accuracy is extremely important, as well as great customer service skills and knowing how to deal with high stress situations and difficult customers."
good,"A lot of training, it takes about 3 months. Hard to get full time. good thing is that you can relocate anywhere there is a cvs and you can pick up more hours at other locations."
good,I enjoyed working for CVS but it is a company based on production before its customers. Requesting time off was always difficult due to always being understaffed.
good,Working for CVS I have definitely learned patience and I've achieved a great deal of pharmacy knowledge. The locations that I have worked have al been high volume  locations. with that being said I've also learned stability by always having to multi task and get things done efficiently.
good,"placing product on the line to be packaged, making sure the area was clean. disposing of any bad, or dented cans. Co-workers could be slow and not helpful at times. The management would listen to most suggestions."
good,"A typical day at work is very stressful"
good,"I am a supervisor who handles training of the new employees, assists current employees with any issues they are having and I take escalated calls.  I enjoy very much working with the patients I talk to and have several patients who only want to talk to me.  The hardest part of the job is to tell patients we are not going to be able to send out their specialty medications that they need very badly.  Sometimes it is a life and death situation with medications such as chemotherapy, heart sustaining medications, transplant medications, etc.  Usually the reasons we cannot ship out the medication is something totally beyond my control such as the insurance company requiring a prior authorization, waiting for the doctors office to fill that information out, waiting for the pa department to process this, and load it into our system.  There are many other reasons that we cannot send out the medication, sometimes.  This is very frustrating to me as I want to help my sick patients."
good,"Good company that allowed me to grow as a technician, but it is hard to grow from here. company is all about customer service and numbers so there isn't much one on one with an employee."
good,"Overall, a fun and easy job. I had the pleasure of working with great co-workers. For the most part, customers were okay, except for a handful of rude and/or demanding ones."
good,"I loved my job and I preformed my daily duties with motivation."
good,Easy to learn new things. The people are nice and work is always around. The customers are nice and management is very considerate of your personal life.
good,"Always busy, and managementdid not have good control over scheduling. Always had call offs and would not be appy if you can't cover."
good,"I highly enjoyed working here. Management was exception and I also had great co-workers. Benefits were amazing, great hours."
good,"There isn't much growing in this company. Everything depends on the store and how the team likes to work.  It is  a fine job if you're looking for something temporary and don't mind doing the same things over and over again, It is also a good way to get your foot into the doorway if this is a stepping stone to your career."
good,"Don't have tight timeline, which will drive you crazy. Relaxed work atmosphere. Typical large company with efficient management issue."
good,"Review of Omnicare is no longer applicable as the company has been bought by CVS."
good,"A very busy work environment, a lot to learn. It was my first technician job so I learned everything there is to know about retail pharmacy. The hardest part as learning how to work with patients insurance."
good,"you work hard, and you get paid a little. they are mostly accommodating with you scheduling needs but hours vary. good for younger people with school needs."
good,Overall a good company to work for. Always emerging and trying new ideas. Al technicians at my location were APTA certified.
good,I like the work of picking the orders and did it well. but I liked the stocking even more because those who pick the orders could trust me to give 110% to keep the locations full and keep them flowing smoothly. I love to sever others and help keep the production levels high and help keep the cost down.
good,I have learned a lot from Cvs and it is a great place for those who wish to become pharmacists in the future. I have learned to deal with greatly different personalities and learned to multitask the most at CVS.
good,"When I first started with this company I knew nothing about Medical Billing. I am now a subject matter expert. I answer questions for the majority of my department, and I provide learning opportunities every chance I get. My knowledge base has grown so much since my first day."
good,"It is a very stressful job and the location I was sent to in GA for a few months was very stressful. The managers were not professional nor cared about their employees. I would never want to work at CVS pharmacy Down town Atlanta again. Working my position I stayed long hours hardly no breaks the manager at this particular store would literally yell at me in front of customers, she did not help me with my goal with the company which was making CVS my career and managing my own store."
good,I took inbound phone calls to complete a structured questionnaire for health care providers to get medications covered for patients at the pharmacy. I learned how to manage multi calls and accurate data entry for part d medicare clients.  Management was very creative and supportive with all aspects of clients and co workers. The hardest part of the job was the commute for me.  I lived 1.30 hours away from the facility.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I receive recognition for doing a good job.
good,"Lots of variety in a regional hub.  Leadership likes to try delude staff into believing that what we do is about more than making money.  It's all about the money.  Fortunately, I've worked with good people in lower levels of the organization."
good,"Plenty of educational opportunities"
good,"A very good Pharmacy Department, with well trained Techs. That is all I can say about this company at this time. CVS health trys to aim for a better health environment."
good,was a great place to work until the company became more about number and less about there employees. I left because the moral was gone.
good,Easy work environment with no challenging tasks.  Good learning environment for developing customer service skills.  Managerial staff consisted of well-rounded individuals that were friendly and understanding.
good,"Working at this company I have learned new skills consistently and "
good,I learned how to stay calm under a stress-elevate situation. I also did not have an outside work life due to the schedule I was assigned.
good,The day at work was okay due to so much problems with our computers. I learned so much about medicine. Great co-workers but not very good managers.
good,"Typical corporate organization where money matters more than people. Very little support from management. Slip once and you are out."
good,"The base pay is very poor for a CPhT even with years of an experience and like any other job you'll have to play politics. Depending on your team, you'll have a great work environment. You'll definitely learned how to work in a difficult work environment. The hardest part of the job is the  administration requests. Even though that's the hardest part, the most satisfying part is to accomplish what seems to be impossible task."
good,"CVS is ok but getting hours is really hard, they tell you its ok to get more hours at other places but not many stores have hours for you to work at."
good,"Nice place to work, good benefits, overall ok with work/life balance. "
good,"At CVS, I learned how to preform tasks such as production and drop off. I would also check out patients with their prescriptions and other items they might have picked up. Overall, it is a nice working experience."
good,you have great co workers have to have great customers skills and patience. If you cant pick up within in a month you will not last long there. Its a 24hr pharmacy. You need to be reliable.
good,"A fast, busy paste, I love that CVS Pharmacy gave me that opportunity to use my pharmacy technician skills and knowledge. I learned to work in a very fast paste and still make it fun. Management was very unorganized, in the three years I was there I had three different pharmacist. Great team player co-workers,The hardest part of the job and most enjoyable part of work are the Customers."
good,upper management not qualified for their positions although the company over all wasn't a bad place to work. most if not all of the operation was unorganized.  the logistics of the business suffered grately
good,"good salary, customer service interactions, fast paced, high volume workload, stressful at times, multi-tasking is a must"
good,"Working for CVS, showed me how to manage and multi-task in certain situations that does not come every day in retail. Learning how to communicate with patients when it comes to their health and well-being."
good,"Its an ok place to work, if it wasnt for my team i wouldnt have stayed so long. I dont like the supervisors or the district managers. they dont pay you enough for what you do and sometimes have to work off the clock just to get the stuff done you are required to get done"
good,The employees are well trained and nice to work with.  The pay is good.  They are always in need of more help. They are very busy busy busy.
good,"management are easy to get along with, all employies work together as a team to get the jobs out, followed up on and completed"
good,"Excellent organization for career advancement opportunities."
good,Company is  great lots of room for advancement the people are great always really nice however the work life balance is hard there schedules go sunday to saturday so you can work 7-10 days straight given the new week starts on a sunday. the company says you cant be scheduled more then 7 days in row on any given week however the upper management never fallows that rule. it is retail and retail involves a lot of hours its just hard on the family.over all a good company to work for.
good,"I worked at a particularly busy CVS. Everyone there tried the best they could and I whole-heartedly believe that, but I quit because it was such a miserable job. On good days we were busy and generally upbeat. Customers will be customers, so I don't hold that point against them. I was hired when they were understaffed and consequently had to learn by doing (which is okay, except insurance can be hard). Sometimes our hours would be cut with no warning. I became certified and took on the duties of a lead tech but no one ever seemed to know what to do to pay me more. As an individual store and a corporation as a whole...just bad."
good,Typical day is very busy. I learned to more faster than normal. Management wasn't that great. Co-workers were ok. They worked very hard. The hardest part of the job is getting all the medication out the cue in one day. The most enjoyable part about the job is helping these patients get there medication.
good,"Right about the time I was really getting the hang of things CVS let me go. I did however learn a great deal of new things because I had never worked in the pharmaceutical aspect of health care. I learned that being a pharmacy technician definitely looks easier that it is, and you have to know a lot of stuff. I learned so much about how insurance companies work and the importance of communication between parties. I really got a lot of practice multitasking and learning that you have to prioritize your goals for that work day. The hardest part of this job was that I did not know too much about the computer system and the way it all worked. I felt like I was kind of thrown in and it was sink or swim. I was very frustrated that I wasn't giving enough training but in the middle of flu season there is only so much you can teach and still stay caught up. The most enjoyable part about my job was being able to get patients prescriptions filled quickly and effectively especially if they were in a desperate situation where waiting was not really an option."
good,I enjoyed working at CVS. I did file an ethics complaint as dishonesty was occurring by the pharmacy manager which was discovered in the ethics complaint. This pharmacy had achieved one of the highest scores for pharmacy operation in the entire chain and the District Manager had presented at a corporate meeting how well the pharmacy manager was performing his job not knowing a lot of the scores achieved by the pharmacy had been achieved through dishonesty and not following policy and procedure by this pharmacy manager. I enjoyed working for CVS but my ethics complaint led to CVS deciding to terminate my employment.
good,"Decent place to work. Fast paced work, good management, and the teamwork was excellent."
good,"My work day starts with pulling all my reports for the day including billing, claims and missing information for claims."
good,"I started working at this company because I worked for Eckerd and they bought out Eckerd's. I saw for the start they were all about customer service and had all employee trained and new job titles, which I had no problem with. They offered good pay and benefits as long as we did our jobs. CVS is a stable company that's probably why I stayed so long. I learned many different duties thanks for their training and was even offered the Lead Tech job. I love working there the employees were always working in team work and we helped each other out even the pharmacist. The only thing I didn't like is whenever the suits came in they never asked how were we or our names. But I would of stayed working with them if I didn't have my back surgery in 2009. I need more time of for my illness and they would not give it to me. I recuperated completely after 4 months but they said I was laid off for not coming back to work on time. Even though I was still under the long term disability that they offered me."
good,"CVS/Health is a leader in the Healthcare Industry. A typical day in the office in the Quality Department is challenging but yet interesting.  The department monitors calls, analyzes for root cause of issues, coaches customer service representatives, looks for trends, reports findings, makes CMS test calls. Travel and training is sometimes necessary at times to certify coordinators at new cites. "
good,"If you don't have experience I don't recommend this pharmacy the lead tech is exceptionally rude and has no desire to help you or answer questions. She is the reason most of their techs quit. However the management and pharmacists themselves are exceptionally nice. You often work without a break or a lunch because it is so busy. You are always doing six things at once and can never finish one thing before being told to do another. They basically only hire for a 11-8pm shift because the other two techs don't work past 5:30-6. Training really is ""figure it out for yourself"""
good,Started out as a temp. It's a very calm typical office job. Not much going on but the people are nice and it wasn't nerve wrecking. If opportunity arise I could consider going back.
good,"Go in stock up cart with cleaning supplies for the day, sweep up all entry ways to building . Then onto morning clean up of mini kitchens and eight washrooms , submit orders for supplies and then start all over after lunchtime."
good,Helping customers to make their shopping experience better.  Dealing with different personalities I have learned to be patient.  Management is fair.  As far coworkers we all get along.  Dealing with angry customers.  Havin.g fun with coworkers
good,"very busy, but just how i like it because i could learn a lot.. employers are very professional and i get along well with everyone. we work as  a team"
good,Typical day is very busy. Not much time to do paper works or managerial work.
good,This company has undergone many buy-outs so the company that I worked for is not the same as under the current ownership and management.
good,"Very friendly organization, great trainers. Pay could be higher but overall an enjoyable job"
good,Stocking lower/upper galleys with supplies'inventory and outdated products.
good,"I would enter in prescriptions in, count pills, check inventory. I learned a lot and I like the job very much. My co workers were great to work with and very will to help me when needed."
good,this review is the same as above. Once you get into a CVS it is hard to leave it feels almost as they make you stay. it can be challenging at times i just wished they valued their employees better
good,I had to help assist customers with there questions on there medications and to also make sure they were taking the correct dosage and to make sure i was filling the medication correctly. i would be glad to get a job here .
good,"The most glaring issue company wide is the vast decline in health care benefits which incidentally coincided with the federal mandate for ""Obama Care."" Sneaky. And the company just moved up the Forbes 500 list. I can't review work conditions as it appears it varies according to the department that you're in and who is your manager. I happen to have a phenomenal manager, but is that enough to outweigh all the other ""cons"" that come with the job? Starting towards a no. The only other information that is pertinent for those wishing to work for Caremark is ensure that you have at least a Bachelor Degree in something. It doesn't matter if it's in Art, Puppetry, or Canadian Studies, but you cannot get promoted even with a hard work ethic and in depth knowledge if you are without it."
good,"CVS Caremark seemed like a really nice company to work for on the surface. The management was kind and efficient, and there was definitely a heavy emphasis on functioning as a team. However there is little to no value placed on new technicians, even those that have gone through the hoops necessary to become licensed and certified. The scheduling was all over the place, not to mention that the rate of pay was nowhere near what an educated technician should be making hourly.The routine was easy to fall into but there is little to no opportunity for advancement as come to find out, CVS doesn't even bother hiring/promoting people as lead technicians most of the time. Considering everything that a tech has to do to stay continually licensed and up to date on the current pharmacy education, I personally thing that they are a bit undervalued. Not to say it wasn't a nice work environment, even if it was a bit hectic."
good,Omnicare has great benefits but the opportunity to advance is not there. The company is customer friendly. My co-workers are great to be around. I enjoy knowing I am helping someones grandparents or parents. The hardest part of the job is getting all the orders on time when someone calls in or we get to busy to meet the deadline for the orders to be typed.
good,depending on position hired for it can be laid back. company could pay there employee better and balance out the work load overtime should be optional as you come in next day and volume is 7 hours of work.
good,"I enjoyed the actual work I did!! The co-workers had a ""click"" that included the supervisors. If one didn't like you then neither did the whole crew. They would lie on you and do everything possible to get you fired!!"
good,"-Complex hours but good managers"
good,challenging at first but gradually understandable. Relaxing once get a hand of your responsibilities and what's required of you. Your co-workers are always there to help you if need to locate something or a helping hand. Most enjoying part is they acknowledge you when you let them know when you need something.
good,A typical day would be to clock in and check the board to find out what work station you have to for the first fours of your shift. A very stressful environment due to co-worker and the pharmacy staff. Co-workers and rude and doesn't like to help the new hires and the pharmacist are so extremely busy. The store I worked at was just a miserable place to work.
good,"It is a great company to work for. Fast paced, long hours and high stress.  You are compensated accordingly."
good,"Being a tech at CVS is a very rewarding position. One feels like they really make a difference in the lives of others. Managers are excellent except sometimes they pacify customers just to get them out of bad situations. The job is extremely stressful though. Upper management i.e district supervisor etc. gives very unrealistic expectations to meet that are literally impossible to achieve in some scenarios. Especially, when corporate drastically cuts hours limiting the amount of available help. Customers are also very rude. If anything goes wrong such as insurance not working properly they instantly blame CVS and you directly even though it is entirely a third party issue. Serving sick people is tough because of their situations and with the current healthcare situation making insurance copays much higher. There are many people that come in that are very genuine and appreciate the help."
good,"learned a lot, long hours, great pay. The training program was great but some parts weren't coordinated accordingly. Liked the co-workers and loved the retail side of it all."
good,Can not really comment. i was an extern. It is a non-paying position.
good,"- Getting Waiting Bin (RTS) reports done."
good,"Working at CVS/Caremark is a rewarding experience as there is a close interaction with customers, which rely on our expertise for the proper delivery of medications."
good,This Job was good as for learning cashiering as well as everything that you might be able to pick up on to take to a better job. Loved working with my co workers
good,Well organized. not enough staff available at times. I learned a lot
good,"my co workers were great, The most enjoyable moments are when i help the customer find what they are looking for and they leave with a huge smile on their face.I learned not every customer is going to be in a good mood they might be sick waiting to fill their medicine but treat them good anyways because it makes them feel so much better. Could have had better management he almost got fired for being rude to employees and customers"
good,Signed on to computer and took calls from members that wanted to refill there prescriptions. Took payment over the phone. I learned to have more patients. Management was there if I needed them. My coworkers were great we worked as a team. Hardest part was switching supervisors. Enjoyable part was the people I met on the job.
good,A typical day at work was to make sure all medications were ready for patients in a timely manner. Update and stock medications as necessary. update control medications inventory. effectively manage pharmacy technicians and assign tasks as appropriate. Good management and helpful co workers. The hardest part of the job was long hours which were up to 14 hours per day with no lunch or breaks. No downtime was best part of the job.
good,"I really enjoy my job as a pharmacy technician. I like being able to know the purpose of each drug we dispense to our customers. The only drawback of this position is that the hours change every week, there is no set schedule. However, if I do know I need to take a certain day off, I can tell the scheduler that I am requesting that day off, and they can work that into the schedule. It's also difficult when you want to call out sick but can't find coverage. If we can't find someone to cover our shift, we have to come into work! My co-workers are helpful and together we all work as a team. There is a half to half ratio of unpleasant customers to really appreciative, nice customers. Some customers can be downright nasty, and I try to put myself in their shoes. You have to just let any negativity go and just be professional."
good,"I worked in the pharmacy for the majority of my time. Working at the front register was decent and a normal experience of being in retail, good and bad customers, and the regulars that know you. The managers and supervisors are all friendly, but make it a habit of complaining and venting about the company, most of the small talk consisted of this. "
good,"This company WAS great to work for. I worked for almost a total of 8 years. Got a good raise every year. Most the time felt respected, and appreciated. and the benefits were pretty great. Pay was good. upper management and LP for this company did not communicate at all. Was told one thing by them then told it was wrong and was fired due to them lying."
good,Love all my coworkers have a great team and a great supervisor. Things are always changing in the healthcare business so it is a daily learning experience. The night shift is tough. Most enjoyable is knowing I am helping people get their medication that they need.
good,Customer service and coworkers were excellent to work with.
good,"I worked at CVS before it was bought out by Caremark. It is a great place to work but in management levels you will have no life and will be working all manner of shifts."
good,"Always work which is good, but management could improve a lot."
good,"Typical day work begins with counting the safe, correcting payroll punches, all emails and faxing needed to be completed for the day shift. Delegating job duties for my shift cashiers and making a to do list for cashiers."
good,"Every day is a busy day, from opening to close. My co-workers work so hard to provide excellent customer service to our customers."
good,"Good company to work for, nice interaction with peers and colleagues."
good,"Nice working Place."
good,"You always had something to do "
good,"I gained all my real work experience from this job. I was taught how to sale, collect, and preform general customer service."
good,Culture varies greatly between departments. Avoid CVS/pharmacy departments at all costs.
good,"The CVS location in which I work is one of the higher volume stores within Philadelphia county. A typical,busy day we would fill more than 500 scripts. The day seems to be more balanced because of relief that is provided by exceptional co-workers.The managerial skills in this environment are great. I seem to have such great support and appreciation here which is why I have decided to stay for the length of time that I have. I have learned a massive amount of information not only about pharmaceuticals but also about being a team player. Prior to this job, I had an extensive amount of experience in working with the public and the ups and downs that comes along with it. Overall, this job has provided a great insight into the pharmaceutical field and the benefits that come along with it. I look forward to expanding my horizon with a new company."
good,A lot of people with coupons would come to the store and would exceed the limit and would get mad at the cashier and think that we are being unfair. Most customers were friendly and they new your name if they liked you. A lot of team work came to play and a lot of expectations needed to be met.
good,"assisting the pharmacist in all possible tasks,attending to the customer questions & concerns"
good,"The company overall seems to be going into another direction. The Pharmacist in Charge is given additional responsibilities on top of the responsibilities we already have. The company is very stingy when it comes to giving team members a raise. The hours are very long-14 hour shifts and my work environment is horrible. "
good,I am responsible for filling prescriptions to be checked by pharmacist so that they can be sent to patients that need their prescription.
good,"A typical day is busy and demanding."
good,"Not enough staff to managed our department,one person calls in when sick has a ripple effect on all of us the rest of our shift! I thought taking this job would keep me from being bored and it does but not having staff can change your mind to continue to be under all this STRESS!!!!!!"
good,"friendly people, and typically each day has work flow that assist the customer.enjoyable part is to work with the crew members"
good,On a daily basis I interact with clients such as Blue Cross or the State of New York to offer their members the highest level of service. The hardest part of the job is when you can't truly help someone in need. The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to help people.
good,the management does not always follow thru.The immidiate managment does what they can. But sometimes the poeple over them dont make things easier.
good,"For the most part I do like my job and the people I work with but I don't get paid much for the amount of work I do. From the minute I walk into the pharmacy the phones are ringing, patients are dropping off and waiting for their prescription, picking up prescriptions, patients at drive thru. I also am responsible for daily orders and weekly orders of medications. If a patients insurance isn't going through than we have to call insurance help desk"
good,"I started this job out working anywhere from 20-40 hours on any given week, then a new district Mgr. came in and has cut hours back for each employee to the point I am getting a measly two day work week with 15 hours. I was told it is not going to get any better than that. Other than broken promises for hours the job is okay. Could use better training when it comes to patient insurance and how to pronounce each medication and its uses."
good,"When I had my interview, I thought it was a good thing because of the raises they give and they have good insurance. They do fail to tell you that until you are fully trained you will be having all night shifts and holiday's are volunteer only and I didn't volunteer for Thanksgiving and they put me on the schedule. I told them I could only work a couple night shifts since I have a newborn and I do all my schooling online and they don't seem to care."
good,"filling medications for customers"
good,"I was ALWAYS stuck at the pick-up station in the pharmacy. The only way for me to get from the pick - up station to any other station, especially drop - off was if everyone quit. How stupid is that? I paid my certification fees to be a pharmacy technician, not a clerk."
good,"Everyday I sit and take between 30 to 40 phone calls from CVS retail employees (Pharmacist ,Pharmacy Techs, Store Managers). Most of the time these employees are upset because one of their work tools are broken, such as printers and computers. They are also upset when there are third party rejections. This mean that there is a complication with the insurance company and most likely the patient will not get there prescription right away. Sometime taking up to two business days to resolve . I learned a great deal is technical support, insurance issues, and ways of wording things to make situation sound better. Management that i have dealt with a CVS are willing to help. Most co-workers that work at the call center are extremely helpful and nice. Unfortunately, it seems like they mostly bond over the fact that they do not enjoy what they are doing. The hardest part of the job is not being trained properly is dealing with insurance issue and dealing with upset Pharmacist. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be resolving issues over the phone making the retail employee is happy."
good,I learned all the necessary things I need to know to do my job xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good,"This is highly detailed work being done at a very fast pace. It is also a window to some of life's greatest troubles such as cancer, poverty, drug addiction, and a lot of folks trying to take care of themselves, their children, and often times their parents or spouses. It can be very stressful. It is also rewarding in that there is always the opportunity to make someone's day a little better."
good,It was at times a very stressful place to work since we knew our location would be closed and we would lose our jobs.  There were many nights we would work either very late or all night to solve the problems and make the necessary software changes.  The co-workers were really great and we worked very well as a team.  Local management was very supportive but corporate management was not very responsive.  I did receive a very good severance package and was treated very good when the time for layoffs came.
good,"Good job with good benefits if you are willing to settled with low pay, the turn over rate of incoming and outgoing employees and increasing challanges. Constant shift in management. No chance of advancement even with further accreditation or education."
good,"A typical day of work for me was opening the store at 7am which also happened to be extremely busy. I worked at a CVS very close to the white house and plenty government buildings so people we're just getting to work. It helps make the day go by a lot faster during the week it's usually 3 periods when it's busy, Early am, lunch time and when people are getting off. Through this job I've learned how to be patient and how to work with people with different backgrounds. Management was really cool as long as you did your work and what was expected and the co workers we're really nice and easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job was working with people that would become irate. The thing I love most about my job is that I actually enjoyed it."
good,"great growing company, wanted to leave to have an increase in pay. Very busy with lots of nice patients."
good,"I filled subscriptions by counting the correct amount of pills of the correct medication the patient required. "
good,"•Receive written prescription or refill requests and verify that information is complete and accurate."
good,There is not much room for advancement.  Started in 2009 and have been in the same position since.  I have great co workers that will help and give support when they are able.  Our lead Joann is wonderful will explain things you may have missed from start to finish.
good,"Very  fast pace, the hardest part of the job was being able to help each member to the fullest in a couple of minutes. I enjoyed work for Caremark Rx"
good,"Work was very fast paced and physical. A typical day included a variety of things to accomplish: scanning all drugs to containers for delivery. paperwork to print, assuring that all medications were accounted for. All insulin were packaged with ice and put in appropriate containers.There was never a lack of work to be done. I learned to pace myself and to organize my area creating a more orderly work flow. Management was hands on and well organized always willing to help out. Other co-workers were willing to help-out anyway they could, pitching in at critical moments. I found the physical aspect of the job very enjoyable. For myself there was nothing hard about it."
good,"Days at Cvs were a start to finish working day, with no lunches, always on your feet no breaks, running from counter to window to computer. I can not complain about that though because that was the lifestyle I lived always on the go on my feet moving. I would say they should have bought us some comfortable shoes. Just kidding They always had us taking tests and learning new things all the time. One thing I like was that they enjoyed my company at the front of the store also where I would help on truck day to stock shelves or when cashiers would call in I could help fill in for them. I didn't like how they didn't have a better system for the theft in the area though."
good,"Although CVS has its heart in the right place, often times customers are very unhappy with the policies set in place by the company. Customers get frustrated easily, which can cause a hectic and stressful work environment for technicians."
good,"It's a fun environment if you're looking for a part-time job just to make a little extra cash, not a job you can make a living off of."
good,"a day in the workplace is very busy but established in a way of helping customer, making sure prescriptions are all verified. there are alot of things that I learned over the pharmacy. as well as customer services help, helping technicians and pharmacist themselves on doing there job."
good,"I enjoy working for CVS Pharmacy. You definitely have room to ""move-up."" My co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job are the long hours and having to work every other weekend."
good,This is a good company with a decent starting pay.  Call's are non stop and each call monitored.  You can even listen to your own calls which they have you grade once a week and you grade yourself.  This is done so that you can see where you can improve.
good,"typical day consisted of answering and making up to but not limited to 100 calls, dealing with people from all over the U.S., completing 100+ cases per day, scanning, faxing, HIPAA, Medicare Part D, third party verification/ The hardest part of the job was missing deadlines as a team when we really tried hard. The most enjoyable part was that the job was close to home."
good,"They have been cut hours so its a little hard to complete some of the tasks and take care of customers, but the customers always come first. I'm a cheerful upbeat person that does my work with the best of my ability and make every customer feel important."
good,"CVS pharamacy was an experience of a life time. I learned so much at cvs. My manager told me if you work here you could work any where, because in his 15 years as a pharmacists he never experienced a store like cvs on 35th and peoria. To me cvs was boot camp  and now im ready for the rest of the world."
good,I was a customer service rep for cvs/caremark. I was in the ctu department (clinical triage unit) and i basically did per-auths. 
good,"the company overall was a decent place to work.  Friendly, and has a sense of belonging.  Where they are lacking is in the ability to communicate effectively in order to achieve a common goal. "
good,Its a great place to work you get to know a lot of people build relationships 
good,"I started working with CVS in high school as a part time cashier and eventually worked my way to the role of trainer for the district."
good,"A typical day for CVS is busy. Retail pharmacy is very demanding in its customer focus. Daily tasks include, tending to customer check out, entering prescriptions, processing prescriptions, submitting refill requests and restocking items"
good,"Great starter job, but the management is not very professional at all.  Often found myself doing things outside my job description."
good,"Fast-paced, interesting to learn about prescriptions, easy-going coworkers and pharmacists."
good,Provide world class solutions to corporate accounts and lead Sales team to accomplish company targets
good,"Co-workers were great for when you needed help with something. Managers kept saying to call them when the ""assist/escalation line"" was busy but they were never at their desks when you needed them. The hardest part about the job was that the training didn't prepare you for all the scenarios & when you needed help or to ask a quick question, you had to wait almost 5-10 minutes before getting someone on the other line to help or had to ""wing-it"" & then get reprimanded because you didn't know the answer."
good,I learned that a job is not always easy but required. Most the time you did the same thing every time you went into work.
good,"This was the first company i worked with. At the time I was there things were great, however a lot of changes have developed since they became CVS/Caremark. From what I have heard from various people who use to work in Customer Service: ""If you start in customer service - transfer to a different department.....FAST!""."
good,After letting go of my co-worker they left me by myself to coordinate care for half of the United States.
good,"This is a long-term care pharmecutical company located is Kansas, MO. They seem to have a lot of turn around but they offer good benefits."
good,"We merged with a local drug store right after I was hired on, so we stayed really busy filling new perscriptions. We rarely had time for breaks that first 3 weeks. My co-workers were friendly for the most part. Management was friendly. The hardest part of the job for me was learning all the pharmacy procedures, coming from working in food service for as long as I can remember. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the new customers and catching up with the veteran customers."
good,"I worked at CVS as a pharmacy technician for 4 years and I found it very stressful. It can be very fast-pace and dealing with patients/doctors can be very difficult. I think to do this job, you need to have a very friendly, understanding personality while being to multitask and maintain professionalism under stressful situations. CVS was a hard company to work for because they were very demanding, they easily cut hours to save money, and scrutinized everything you do. It was an OK job while I was in college, but I could never make a career out of it."
good,"a typical day at work, the enjoyable thing was wrong with nice and friendly people"
good,CVS pharmacy is a good pharmacy to work for but I am having trouble getting enough hours as the market in Atlanta is extremely flooded. I need a position that will allow me to work proper hours and have a regular schedule as opposed to
good,Answering phone calls to help answer any patients questions. Keeping a clean and organized pharmacy. Filling all rx orders as they were given. Typing and insuracne claims. Keeping record of the weekly inventory.
good,"You either like retail or you don't is the easy way to start, it is a large company and they have made it clear that unless you become a manager of a store or higher, they don't really care about you. Many of the store managers will tell you what ever you want to hear and will make a promise as easily as they will break it. They will make transfers from one store to another and difficult as possible and impossible, and will not listen to you if you have an idea"
good,Receive and verify written prescriptions from Doctors
good,"Excellent place to learn about the PBM Business...however, in Account Management employees are stifled in growth potential being held back by management"
good,"brainless work most of the time. maintain a clean environment, keep your shelves stocked, and help customers as needed"
good,Very busy call center. Multiple distribution pharmacies around country. National company. Good wage to start. Good benefits.
good,"During the course of a work day, and being in retail, you do encounter some unusual customers. You learn to take everything said with a grain of salt. Most customers are very nice, courteous, and friendly, and the handful that are not - well, that just makes you laugh, and shake your head. We clown around, especially, during the busy holiday season. It gets you through your day. Dressing up at halloween is always a stress-buster. It's fun, and customers love it!"
good,"good company otherwise. Daytime hours. Relaxed environment on the surface, Subtle, uncalled-for corporate pressure."
good,"If this company were as good as they thought they were, they would be great. No need to elaborate or bore you, but let's just say their mission statement is all about the shareholder, not its employees. No consistency by management, employees are FORCED to work OT in January, February, and March. Some months as much as 28hours. Talk about work life balance. No true recognition for doing your job or going beyond the call of duty. Just do it and be happy you have a job. If that sounds like a place for you then go for it."
good,Never a dull moment in the world of Pharmaceuticals and Medicare Part D.
good,"Do to the desition made by corprate they shut down our whole division, the people that I work with and for was great just wish the hire up's would have look at another way and cut some of there big salaries before they cut us."
good,Positive growth opportunities.
good,"Manage the store's Photo Lab and its staff of 5. Train all employees on how to use photo processing equipment, and cash register. I learned how to trouble shoot and fix machinery issues, process film, and order the lab''s equipment and supplies."
good,Eight hours on telephone out going and incoming calls. Ignore politics of office. Management not always cooperative. Most of coworkers easy to get along with. Hardest part of job was watching my back. Most enjoyable employee activities.
good,"I worked over night here and I actually had a pretty good time. I made some really good friends and the location I worked at was really nice. The job held your basic clerk duties, but at night it's not so busy and it allows you to get to know your coworkers while you get your job done. You can also grow in this company and it offers you good benefits and a comfortable life."
good,This company offers plenty of opportunity for growth in medical & privacy regulations.
good,"My experience working within the Health Professional Development Department was high-paced, diversified and never the same from one day to the next. The culture is driven by the collective successes of individuals who are a part of a greater team. Each professional I came into contact was supportive and willing to work hard to meet our organization's business objectives. My co-workers were great."
good,The typical work day is a hit and miss in terms of work load. I like staying busy so that is not a problem at all. The employees here are great to work with and its a team environment all the time. Altough trying to move up in the company is quite hard. I am getting laid off and have tried nurmerous times to move departments to continue my career path within CVS Caremark and have been denied due to outside applicants getting a job. I understand everyone needs a job but I would think a company as large as CVS Caremark would try to keep their employees. There are only 6 of us in the department and it's next to impossible to get a job in the company.
good,I enjoyed working with a great team ( we were a family). The hardest part of the job was working long hours....and the most enjoyable part of the job was building a relationship with patients.
good,Most pharmacists are good to work with. Work flow could use some improvement but not an entirely terrible place to work. possible to meet many interesting people.
good,"from being at warehouse unloading products to cleaning facility to helping phamacy move out percriptions overall was good, the co workers made the day go by so fast made. new managers all the time made it difficult get custom to. the physical demand would make hard but the environment was enjoyable. I learned to multi task any circumstances."
good,Management promotes people who are incompetent or only those whom they like.
good,I learn something new at Coram everyday. It's a great place to work
good,I enjoyed helping people with the items they purchased in the store.
good,•Received telephone and in-person orders for prescriptions
good,"CVS was a great learning experience I learned how to relate with customers and multitask. Management was not always the best. We were way under staffed only two people would work at one time and that consisted of a floor manager who would work in the back and a cashier who would work the front dest. The hardest part of my day was the long hours. The most enjoyable part of my day was being able to relate to costumers and lending a helping hand. CVS was a great job, but they would schedule me for times i could not work; like when i needed to be in school. They also gave me too many hours. I was in high school full time and working 35+ hr a week."
good,it didnt feel like a team effort after awhile when working for CVS. the managers didnt really care about the employees and the benefits were not that great.
good,If you follow everything you were taught in training and abide by rules you will be fine. Always give a hundred percent and remember that some people may be at their worst but you must always be at your best.
good,I learned alot about wrkin overnights workin there and hw to deal with rude drunk customers n person
good,"As far as retail companies, CVS is a good company to work for. The benefits are decent and the pay is a bit higher than some of the other companies in the retail pharmacy chain category. The roughest part of the job is really having to work every weekend and almost every holiday. That's to be expected, to a certain extent, when you're working in retail on the management level but eventually it begins to be too much and affects your quality of life."
good,"A repetitive day, multi-task, okay environment, keeping updated with new information everyday, enjoy the pay check"
good,Very productive and definitly a learning experience. I enjoy the people i work with
good,I didnt like sitting there for 8hrs and typing all day. Go in at 7 leave at 430 and type all day. I learned quick key programs and Data Perfection. Worked with kronos and learn net.
good,"They use hiring agencies and ""temp to hire"" so they dont have to keep you and they can get rid of you when ever they please. There are workers there that have been there for over a year and and there still under ""temp to hire""."
good,"There is no room for advancement at CVS,and for the many duties we have the pay is not great. CVS does'nt offer bonuses for jobs that are completed in a timely manner and only care if they have a body to work no matter if you are ill."
good,"CVS is a good warehouse to work at. As long to you work hard, do your job on a daily basis and meet the standards your positions require.  Only the feeling for advancement was not there."
good,"CVS is a good choice for a career in retail. The corporate pressure can be extreme, but you are rewarded for hard work. The stress that comes with an upper management position is not for the faint of heart, however, and you will be pushed to your limits. I would not recommend an entry level position with CVS, as cashiers and clerks are paid poorly and treated as replaceable."
good,"I like my job mostly, I feel over worked and too much pressure to work more hours then already assigned. I feel I should be able to plan according to my scheduled hours without fear of being asked to work more then assigned."
good,Only worked there a few months. I would have stayed if I had the transportation. The co workers were not up to par with the job honestly. There was drama within the workers and management didn’t really try much to solve. But if you looking for a job and you are to yourself definitely a good choice.
good,cvs is a good company to offer good benefits. It has become busy and expected the perfect accomplishment by number. company does not provide enough help.
good,Nothing to say at this time. I don’t want to say anything. Go find out for yourself and see if you want to work there otherwise forget about it and don’t apply.
good,"Nice place to work , but not a place to advance, if your looking for a career. They only gave me 2 days a week. The employees are nice . Just weigh your options carefully."
good,"Not great for having a life outside of work, but compensated greatly. Expected to come in early and stay late regularly to meet unfair metrics. People are fantastic though, just a lot of corporate bs to deal with."
good,"At CVS Pharmacy, I have had the chance to learn more about pharmacy and also about teams. I was a staff pharmacist and then a pharmacy manager. I have learned how to build teams and work hard to achieve results."
good,The work environment is pretty cool. They always have something going on for the workers. Like they feed you during holidays and other events like  Detroit 313 day. Attendance policy could use a little more work. Along with the break system. But I guess that's the sacrifice you have to make to have those nice hours.
good,"stressful environment"
good,CVS is an employer driven by numbers. Workload have doubled if not trippled in the last year. They will be asking you to do the impossible. If you work their expect to work at least 2 hours of the day off the clock
good,It’s was an okay starter job. Good cashier experience and customer service. But the location was kind of unorganized. But the supervisor are on the employee side.
good,"The work environment varies tremendously between stores.  Some stores are very hectic and stressful, while others may be a lot more relaxed.  The new features available online to pharmacy staff is quite helpful."
good,"1.fast pace work environment "
good,I enjoyed the atmosphere and the people I worked with. Ability to meet established goals and deadlines. Communication skills. Collaboration skills and teamwork. Problem-solving skills. Attendance and dependability.. Builds company morale and cooperation through effective group ...
good,Low level managers are usually very good. The pharmacy manager and regional are good to work for. Above them is disorganized. Flexible hours. Will work you overtime then you will get in trouble for it. Never enough hours to make the pharmacy run properly. Good workers though.
good,Day to day is very busy and quick paced. Requires ability to pay attention to detail but to also work quickly. Retail setting requires a lot of face-to-face customer service interaction.
good,"A typically day at work consisted of helping customers with their items and bagging and checking out, stocking shelves especially candy items, pulling old tags that are no longer on sale and replacing with new tags that are now on sale, taking out the trash before the shift is over, going around the store and fronting the items so that way the store looks nice and neat. Work place was fairly good. Coworkers are nice and easy to get along with. Management could use some work especially with scheduling employees (for example only scheduling some employees one or two days a week to work) as well as being fair with employees and job titles."
good,"You have a manager that dont even say how are you doing like youre a nobody,supervisor real nice but do what the manager saids,coworkers are amazing people"
good,It was a good job to get some management experience with. Great chance to work on advancement projects and manage a team. I learned how to do everything from ordering stock to leading team discussions on improving our scores.
good,"Management was understanding and flexible with giving time off, and patient in regards to the learning curve. I left on good terms. Hours keep getting cut though."
good,"Nice Company but wrong people selected to train need to know how to train. Trainer had no people skills or patience. "
good,"The pay was a little bit on the low end, but as you gain experience and trust you get raises. There is plenty of room to progress up the ranks and eventually become a store manager."
good,"Loved my coworkers , learned new computer system  lots of on hand experenice , had to help train new pharmacists on the system , hard to keep the ordering system I ncheck"
good,"A typical day here depends on the shift that you receive. I had the day and weekend shifts. During those times it could be very stressful especially after 6:00 pm on the weekends because other pharmacies are closed after that time so there are new and a lot more patients coming in to transfer their prescriptions, coming from Urgent Care or the E.R."
good,"I really enjoyed working there everyone was friendly to work there. management was friendly, If we had questions they were right there to answer them."
good,"I first was excited to work for Cvs/pharmacy, I had great managers, along with great colleagues! Work and customers were fairly easy to deal with. But protection or proper compensation for your work is not a true priority and that’s where I draw a line!"
good,"As a Store Mgr, you are very hands on.  There are no training hours, you don't get paid for extra hours you work or get compensated for extra duties or responsibilities.  You don't get extra hours for resets, planograms, or holidays."
good,"Busy pharmacy, filling about 500 prescriptions daily.  Small town feel until lead pharmacist retired. Became more bureaucratic with red tape and difficult to please patients."
good,I enjoyed working there. I had great pharmacists to work with. The only downside to working at cvs is that you don't get health benefits or vacation time if you don't work full time and it's hard to get a full time position.
good,"CVS pharmacy has good benefits and pay, as well as retirement. Work can be stressful because staffing is very tight, especially on the weekends- Sometimes there is no tech or help at all."
good,"Every store is different, I worked at one great store and one not that great. They are consistent but leave no room for advancement as a technician. They often over work people due to the demand of production."
good,It's a pretty good place to work. The demand for reliable workers is very hard. You gotta work as a team and make sure that you get your part of the job done everyday you're in.
good,"They don't give you enough people, room, or the ability to function properly. They have great ideas... but it's being executed poorly. They can't train someone properly in an environment where it's so busy that everyone just does everything for the new person because there is no down time to teach."
good,"Days are often busy with minimal breaks."
good,"As much as I love working at CVS, there have been almost no room for advancement. It’s very hard to get hours between March-June. I work hard and it doesn’t always feel appreciated by management. However, I have learned so much and will always remember my time with this company as a positive one."
good,"This company makes changes A LOT. If you don't like change, this isn't the place for you. I was a Customer Care Rep and was switched to different departments involuntarily. It's hard to get promoted to higher level positions depending on your line of business within the company. The benefits are good. Pay is decent, but could be better."
good,"This job is great if you want the same thing every day. People get frustrated easily when product is not in stock, but as long as you are nice, and try to find a solution everything will be okay."
good,"Great learning experience and get to see different side of patients. Flexible with scheduling but hours aren't the greatest. Lots of new things to learn about insurance, billing, and finding new prices that patients will enjoy."
good,There is a pretty consistent lifestyle with CVS pharmacy. everyday will most likely be the same with the chance of getting a different customer.  Pharmacist is very fun t work with and very helpful. Very simple and typical job
good,Need to be able to work under pressure and work fast. Pharmacists expect you to know and be able to do many tasks that come with the job. Its also alot of things you have to know that are not fully covered in your training
good,every one places their part but when there is 1 person who doesnt put in 100% then it shows. the other technicians then have to pick up the slack of that person and management doesnt say anything
good,"My initial supervisor was great!. My second supervisor was good as well. There are a lot of phony people in leadership positions there, that talk about new hires, and just people in general. The calls can sometimes be overwhelming, and CVS as a company KNOW they need to pay their employees a lot better than they do!.. They do have a cafeteria fully staffed with great cooks and good people (for the most part).. If you're looking for a career- career this may not be the place for you.. It seems like you have to jump through hoops to meet criteria to get promoted."
good,"The job is easy and repetitive, I learned basic customer service skills, management was well involved in store advancement. Good job for college students or fresh out of high school. Flexible hours."
good,"I have worked with CVS for little over a year and it has definitely been steady for me. Depending on where you're located, your store could be losing hours or be overstaffed. This is a problem our store has faced in the previous few months. Hours are kind of slimming down and people aren't getting as many as they need. If they paid more, this wouldn't be such a big issue, but they don't like to give livable wages that often. In my experience, it doesn't matter how much you work, how hard, or what you put into the job. Wages are based off of how you can manipulate the system or who you know."
good,"Very busy days, challenging, but love the patient interaction"
good,"Understaffed is the major issue at CVS .  I would like to see more helps, especially overlapping pharmacist hours.  Overworked and understaffed are the major issues."
good,"A typical day at work can be either a disaster or an easy going day. CVS is notorious for being understaffed and will not allow new hires. While working for CVS you will learn a lot (if you work at the right store). I have worked at multiple stores across my city and have found that training protocols are very different from each store. While we all do the same trainings on computer, the only real training we can receive is IN PERSON and on the job, which is where protocol lacks. There are employees who only learn how to do one part of the job and will never even touch any other responsibilities within a year of working, meanwhile I personally learned everything there is to know about the pharmacy within a year because of my amazing team leaders. CVS is flexible with scheduling but again this depends on who your colleagues are. Overall CVS has been a great experience for me but some cannot say the same."
good,CVS is a good first job to teach you customer service skills and how to talk to people. All of my coworkers and management were very friendly. I didn’t mind working at CVS. I just couldn’t see myself working there for the long run.
good,"CVS pushes teams to achieve outstanding results in order to exist as a for profit healthcare company where margins are tighter than ever.  A great place to gain experience or a great place for job stability, but expect to work hard."
good,"need for advance possible, ive been stuck where i am since i started."
good,"Fast pace,  high volume, dual screens, medication orders of medication, customer service , handling customer issues and resolving problems on a regular basis, insurance information, prescription insurance, mail in prescription orders."
good,every day was something different. I worked in LP so catching shoplifters was more of my game. They then eliminated the LP program due to company policies which forced me to leave the company.
good,"as much as i love my coworkers and current manager, the job is hard to do sometimes because of the stress from all the patients and not having enough people on the schedule"
good,"Requires acute critical thinking, high motivation, productivity, and focus as well as great customer service. Multi-tasking skills are highly valuable"
good,In worked for 2 locations. One was great loved the store manager and staff I worked with very friendly well run store. The other location I transferred to in Indiana had a manager and leads that I had no respect for and very quickly left the company.  In have since applied at other CVS locations and never gotten a response to those applications even after a face to face introduction to the store manager initiated by myself.
good,IT CAN  be a very rewarding job. But then you have a few colleagues who come just for the fun and call out at last minute and stress falls on you . Its a good job though
good,It was a great place to work with great people there to help and coach you along the way! The pay was good and it was enough to help my mom and relatives with stuff.
good,I didn't mind the work. You work fast and you work mainly by yourself. There is always the production rate hanging over your head. When you first go into orientation you are told if you don't make production you will lose your job. Those numbers are hard to reach most days but it can be done. I am just not one of those who like having numbers over my head. I did enjoy that you get to work quickly and you know what your job is.
good,I don't remember a lot about working at this company. It was challenging working there because of my concerns for those taking the medications. Some clients would have to choose to pay for medicine or pay bills
good,Typical pharmacy environment. A good stepping stone to other opportunities. Pay raises come in low increments which is standard operation procedure in today's job market.
good,CVS gives adequate benefits but doesn't schedule personnel to cover the amount of workload that the stores have.  Three people for a pharmacy that produces almostfive hundred scripts a day is quite unacceptable.
good,This place is very stressful you work extremely hard and depending on the manager they make you float all day. Good pay but way too much over time to the point you don’t get to spend time with your family enjoy the weekend or relax. They seem to not care or be concerned about how you feel and your opinion doesn’t matter.
good,"I would recommend this job as a certified pharmacy technician, however, very low pay compared to other retail pharmacy stores. Almost zero benefits, no recognition, more work less benefits, unfortunately. If they change a little of this to give little benefits and recognise their employees who work so hard, I think the company will do even better than what they are already doing."
good,I was a supervisor when i left. the  job demanding and a lot of the rules for safety need to be learned. I didnt like how many people was allowed in the store at one time. they have good benefits program.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was when patients were nice and very appreciative of the service you provided them. It made it all worth going through everything you did during the day.
good,Can be a fun place to work. I've noticed private pharmacies tend to pay alot more though. They do offer flexible hours and work around your schedule..
good,"Flexible hours"
good,"every day was smooth, no problems,ppl nice to each other "
good,CVS Pharmacy is a better place to work for the younger crowd. Those with families and multiple obligations tend to have a harder time finding work-life balance at this company.
good,"I was able to learn so much while working at CVS and, thankfully, had such a wonderful boss! However, we were always understaffed, while being graded on every task, which really detracts from customer service efforts."
good,A typical day was very hectic and fast paced.  The best part of the job was the customers that frequented the store. A pharmacist was always on duty to assist.
good,working at CVS it was one of the less stressful jobs . On a typical night at CVS you will have a few customers come into the store through out the night so you will be able to stock all floors . While working at CVS I learned how to become better with customer service .
good,I liked working there but it seemed like there was not much opportunities for advancement. Great manager who treated his employees fairly. Fun environment to be in.
good,"I started as a cashier. I moved up to a team leader very quickly and was working on getting an assist position. I don't really have much more to say. I enjoyed working there, although it was very stressful at times."
good,I worked in a high pace call center dealing with pharmacies and insurance companies. I had to abide by HIPAA and insurance laws. I handled several operating systems all at once.
good,CVS Caremark offers a great work environment. They do offer the ability to remotely work and believe in work life balance. Job security is also there. Management can be better though.
good,if your looking for just a 9 to 5 job then yes. hope that you have coworkers and would get your back and don't think for themselves. benefits are okay not the super best. a lot of hour cuts so you better be able to work by yourself. Hope your PIC (pharmacist in charge) is great person if not good luck.
good,CVS pharmacy was a great job for me when I was in my teen years. At the time I was in high school while working at the same time. This was a great experience for me though to work for the public and make a difference giving everyone the right products to better their health and well being.
good,Great place to work. Plenty of opportunities for advancement. During my 12 years with CVS I was able to acquire many skills that help me advance to higher positions.
good,"Front desk casher, stoking and photo lab. I learn a different culture and management skill. I learn managers relation and commitment with all employee"
good,"Inventory Management"
good,"For the majority of employment(9 1/2 years, I love working at CVS. It was when I was comforted with a situation of being robbed by a maniac.I thought he was going to pulled a gun and shoot me."
good,"There are some improvements needed, as with any company, but it's family. I love what I do at CVS Specialty and why I do it. The bosses are the absolute BEST!"
good,I worked as a pharmacy technician at CVS for a little over a year and I have to admit that I quit because I simply did not like the job. Often times I would work 10+ hours a a day with only a 30 minute break where I would get to sit down. Often times I would spend 9+ hours on my feet.
good,CVS Health monitored all your calls which was not accurate.  They also monitor how many times you went to the bathroom.  Some people would fall asleep on the phone an never were reprimanded.
good,CVS Pharmacy is enjoyable with the right team and management.  In my experience at several various locations they are willing to work with you and attempt to accommodate your schedule.
good,"Customer service is the main priority at CVS.  Making sure the customers needs are met.   Greeting people who enter, directing them to location of product and assisting  customers with questions about product."
good,Pharmacist and intern pay is competitive.  CVS has provided all the tools needed to do the job.  Technician help is on the low side.  Hiring a new technician can be arduous.
good,"Great place to work, learning experience, quick pace, employees are helpful and love the environment. Managers are helpful. But sometimes over worked."
good,"A typical day at work includes entry and filling of prescriptions, as well as ringing out patients and customers. We work inside of Target, so some collaboration with Target has to be done. Immediate management is phenomenal. The hardest part of the job is that I am often the only technician working, sometimes for 10 hour shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job is the positive and meaningful interactions I have with patients and patrons, as well as Target team members who work with us."
good,The company is great to work for. I do not have anything negative to say about the company Caremark. It compensates the employees with fair compensation.
good,"Nice place to work, fast paced environment. My day is very pleasurable. If you want to improve yourself there are many opportunities to do that, company has many programs to advance yourself. If you are looking for a job that makes your time fly by this is the place for you. Co-workers are very nice to work with. Company has a great 401K program. Vacation time is paid if you are a full time emplyee, part time employees can have vacation time but it is unpaid."
good,They put too much emphasis on metrics and adherance. Especially with making sure you have quantity of phone calls met instead of providing quality service.
good,"Working as a Pharmacy Tech was very educational.  I got to see  how the prescriptions were completed.  What it takes to work with the insurance companies.  Also, really find out what pharmacist actually do."
good,Human resources department very weak in dealing with Union situations properly. High volume faced paced environment great group of employees and management
good,"busy, fast paced environment at times, great co-workers, enjoyed working with the various distribution centers and associates, opportunity for advancement"
good,Working at CVS warehouse was very challenging. if you are not physically fit then I do not recommend this job to you. This job ifs for a physically fit individual
good,I am leaving due to stress need a change of scenery  great company great benefits great pay but workload is getting too demanding where they are no longer concerned with patient safety
good,"fast paced, needed a better way to que work orders equally to workers through out the day. Should monitor who log out of there phones to make it fair to others workers who receives phone calls after phone calls then you can see others are not on there phone."
good,"Nice people to work with, but the company culture is all about profits. Opportunities to grow within the company in other sectors, but not at the pharmacy."
good,CVS Caremark is a call center that I worked for.We would typically work 10-12 hours a day. Overtime was always allowed and needed..Management was always there for support.
good,"This job is great for people looking to learn. CVS management isnt great though, i think the managers are great but you are required of to much for a little pay."
good,"job is repetative which is not a bad thing but bottom line there is not enough pay for the job requirements, most stores are understaffed making it really hard to keep up with everything."
good,I enjoyed the atmosphere. My team consisted of me and another coworker. We were the credit analyst and reviewed all new and renewal contracts. We didn't have a manager the last 6 months due to the fact that she was based in Phoenix. It was hard to leave but we were given no choice.
good,I worked at a very high paced and very high stress retail pharmacy with 2 drive though stations. I was forced to leave when they would adjust to my at-the-time post surgery work requirements. No longer applicable at this time.
good,"I usually came to work to be told to do stock it was an easy job until I got proficient at it so I was told to work on another thing such as going in the back to work check on stock, help customers with anything they needed and help move packages from the truck to the back."
good,Good place to start as a new Nurse Practitioner Does simple diagnosis so no growth in caring for chronic illnesses. Salary is not competitive therefore the turnover rate is high.
good,"Worked in the pharmacy and my team was great, but CVS really tried their hardest to provide as little hours as possible to save as much money as possible. Meaning that everyone would have to push pretty hard just to get the primary work done. All other work would be put aside for the lower volume days, but it doesn't always work out as planned."
good,Enjoyed working here being with the public.. Seemed very stressful at times when they didn't have enough help.  I loved being busy but not to the pint You cant think straight
good,"I found the training to be very thorough and well-organized, but working on the call-center floor became stressful and too fast-paced for me, because our group was trained several times to add more platforms and information, so we could take more calls from different queues."
good,"You have the opportunity to operate the store to how you believe it will be successful.  The most challenging part is to balance a high paced retail environment, pharmacy and district training you have to be a committed individual."
good,"I loved the flexibility on hours that this job provided.  I loved doing audits in assigned nursing facilities, such as working with physicians, administrators and nursing directors to gap any communications between the pharmacy and nursing facilities."
good,working for CVS as my first pharmacy job is that you need to e fast paced yet still be able to pay close attention to detail. THe store I worked at was extremely busy and as a new be if you aren't good you wouldn't even get a chance to show your worth. you kind of have to fight for a spot. that place made me grow as a tech for sure and I would recommend it for first time techs. BUt you'll surely find out what youre made of working there.
good,"Great benefits. Medical,dental,vision, and prescription benefits.Not great pay. Not a lot of room for advancement in the pharmacy. You can take on more responsibility, but they don't pay for those extra responsibilities."
good,Poor leadership. Could do a better job at understanding that people do the important work. Knowledgeable employees but incapable of decision making ability.
good,I just got laid off but the company was great to work for but I am trying to get back on at a different location with new management and great people and positive people to work for
good,Its an alright job. The coworkers are friendly and you really do get to work with some great individuals. You get to meet new people and get to work with some great management. The only problem I have with CVS is the poor salary and career advancements.
good,Fast paced work environment and everyone worked well as a team. Provided extensive training program prior to working as a pharmacy technician. Sometimes stressful because of the amount of work
good,I worked pursuant to a specific FIPS 140-2 compliance objective and completed the objective. It was a typical example of a large corporate PMO. I was engaged to achieved an objective that had previously fallen behind schedule.
good,Honestly the job was just not for me. I really couldn't ask question when i had doubts or concerns. I was hoping to gain a little more knowledge from the experience.
good,"they worry about budget too much so you end up working shifts by yourself and low staff. you get all the backlash when either insurance mess up or the doctor mess up even though you have no control over what they do. but you do get paid sick leave and vacation, a good amount, you will need it because of the stress, techs do not get paid enough for all that they do."
good,"This job was very high paced and sometimes very stressful, but with the right crew, shifts went smoothly. Expecting to be off on time was sometimes stretching it."
good,"Scattered working hours"
good,"While working in the pharmacy, the pharmacists were the management.  They were helpful when they could be, but given the busy nature of their job, there was limited time for teaching and training."
good,"Great place to learn about pharmacy and medical conditions/diseases but understaffed a lot & high turnover due to low wages, however incentives and yearly wages do give opportunities to  earn more over time."
good,Not a bad place to work.  I have enjoyed working with CVS and the current team I work with.  Overall the culture at CVS is average.  Of course many places have opportunities but I feel you are there to help make a difference.
good,"I think if they had more training it would have been better. There is a lot to get to know in a short period. Not all smart sets are set up correct which could easily cause errors. Management and everything else was great. It is time consuming running people's insurance, which makes seeing pts long and most patients do not know this ahead of time so they get very aggravated with the clinic and providers."
good,Under staffing has caused issues with customer service making it a difficult place to work. The patients I work with are challenging and the job is very complex and mentally exhausting.
good,"you have to make lots of patient calls"
good,"working here is relatively easy, the repetition day in and day out sometimes is more than you can bare but it beats working with customers. Everything you do is timed and you have to meet certain quotas and percentages."
good,"Customer Service is a job , if done correctly, that takes time. I don't believe enough time is given to care for patients. We are reprimanded on calls taking too long. The stats we have to follow are not fairly judged. Some calls take longer than others. I like to give patients a feeling that we care without making them feel like a number. We are micro-managed. They listen to lots of our calls and even in between calls if speaking to someone else. I have seen many people taken out by ambulance, mostly due to stress."
good,"Great manager, and flexible with scheduling around my classes for undergrad, but cannot get more hours when my classes cut back. Not expected to take a lunch/dinner break if you work less than 12 hour days and even then, you are expected to eat your food in the pharmacy while working. No stools, chairs, etc. So you must stand on your feet for the entirety of the shift. If you've never worked in retail, be prepared to be cussed, screamed at, and verbally beaten down by customers almost daily. Despite working your butt off, they think you're stupid and lazy. Although I enjoy helping the customers that treat you like people, it can be hard dealing with the rude ones.  The work is fast paced, and rewarding when you really connect with regular customers, but you are not compensated financially compared to the work you do."
good,"Each day you never new what to expect. As a Market Investigator a CVS Health we were depended upon to make very important decisions based on company policies, procedures and guidelines. The Market Investigator was highly respected by the store management and often called upon for guidance /suggestions for shrinkage."
good,A typical day at work is okay. Learned so much about prescriptions and loved helping customers with their order. Management was okay but not awesome. Not much enjoyable as it should be.
good,"Working at CVS Health I was able to strengthen my time management skills. The most enjoyable part of my job was, working with management and leading a team of 16 employees."
good,Some of the people there are just so immature and they just tolerate too much foolery there.  I need  to work with adults. This is a new location been up and running for a little over a year and they still don't have it together.
good,"- A typical day at CVS involved verifying prescriptions, answering phone calls, helping technicians at stations where help was needed, counseling patients, and giving out immunization/vaccination shots."
good,"CVS isn't a bad company to work for; they offer quite a few benefits. However, there is very little opportunity for advancement and the work itself takes little to no thought. The management team I had was absolutely fantastic. Communication was excellent, reviews were frequent, and all of my supervisors and manager were very positive - not all departments are like that."
good,"productive, fun working staff and customers . you get to know customers on a personal level to make them feel important at every visit to the pharmacy"
good,Work days are ok. Just come to work and get the job done in a timely manner. As the lead Tech I would coronate the other employee's in the area on day to day runs. Make sure medications are out on time and correct.
good,Take inventory of card wall and pull bottle supplies to schedule what is needed to fill inventory card requirements.If there is not enough bottles for stock or production I would order from drug supplier. Assign to my workers the task of day and check the done product before a signs off to okay as inventory. Everyone is interacting to keep filling all scripts to be prepared to be delivered to hospital facilities.I was able to learn quickly interacting with all departments to improve quality of work and able to help those other departments in the process when needed. The hardest part of the job was to acquire patience for training worker patterns and how everyone has more strength one way but may not in others. Some time may be needed to better equip the worker to be successful so the outcome would be more fulfilling for employee and productive for the organization. I enjoyed working with all the people I worked with and with my efficiency of work it was a challenge to complete all tasks with a proficient eye for detail which i strive to maintain and take great pride accomplishing.
good,"It was an okay place to work. I liked it. It was slow and easy. It was a good experience. The pay was good. The manager was respectful. Overall, i enjoyed it"
good,"CVS health is the best company. l will recommend to anybody to work with cvs health, they care about their patient and also make sure patient get their satisfaction .They have nice and clear  enviroment.we  somethig have ping pong ."
good,"Customers always made the day go by quicker, phones are always busy customer sometimes can a little harsh but nothing no once cant handle . End of the month right into the 1st of the month is always the busiest."
good,"Must be able to perform all duties except for pharmacist duties (drop off, production, customer service, answering calls) I enjoyed the job but it is hard work."
good,"good benefits and vacation time there is little down time very physical work lots of opportunities to change positions in the warehouse stocking, picking, and packaging"
good,"A typical workday includes printing prescription labels, pulling medication, counting medication, waiting on customers, customer phone calls in regards to all pharmacy actions, cashiering, and assisting customers in locating items within the retail store. I learned how to do all the duties involved with being a pharmacy technician and how to be an effective and integral part of a team. The overall cultural of CVS is one of reaching goals and maintaining standards. CVS believes that all actions can be tracked and every employee should be able to perform the tasks at a certain level of competency. The most challenging part of the position is adapting to a large variety of personalities and at the same time this was the most enjoyable part of the position as well."
good,"can be stressful during flu season, in order to meet the demands of the customers and your district manager, so be prepare to accept the metrics from the company higher-up"
good,"Always under appreciated by corporate/regional staff, ""catch 22"" of not being allowed enough staff to meet metrics properly for customer satisfaction vs. ""being punished"" for not meeting metrics. "
good,"CVS is not a bad place to work. It all depends on the people you work with. You can either work as a team or not at all. I am all for being a team player, but if other people don't pitch in and do their part then nothing will get done. I am all about fairness and equal opportunity. Everyone deserves a chance to achieve greatness."
good,"The place work be better if they hire enough people. The whole building is under-staff. They also need designated trainers and proper hours to train new employees. Like I said, its an okay place to work. Not a lot of inside drama just females being females."
good,I liked working at CVS Minute Clinic but it was very stressful and long hours and then I had to drive over 60 minutes home each day.  It was a fun place to work but you are totally alone except for the phone for resources.  The patients can be very rude at times
good,"Management really can vary but as long as management backs up its team then a day at work can be smooth. The reality of working there it really makes a difference if you like to talk to people. Some people "" customers"" are really rude, then  you have your regulars who are amazing! the general public is a tough atmosphere but not bad at all times."
good,"High staff turnover with constant staff being absent.Made running of a normal day unnecessary difficult. Technicians are poorly paid and totally unmotivated.When you phone the district manager for help  ,you get no answer so you left to deal with ever situation you confronted with.Instead of the CEO  getting paid a few million dollars it should go to the lowly paid workers."
good,"Very straight forward, most positive aspect is it is very comfortable. Mostly sitting down in a cubicle.  It is what you make of it .... "
good,"A typical day at cvs was really busy, but also productive and also fun. A regular day starts off normal but picks up around 11am. There was a lot to be done with an average of about 400 prescriptions a day. Work slowed down about 7:30 in the evening."
good,"Working in the pharmacy is constantly busy and it requires you to work on your multitasking skills.  Helping the person in front of you, while talking to someone on the phone, while selling a prescription all at the same time, really helps with time management.  The store needs a little work, but with the right team, everything could flow smoothly."
good,My immediate management team is amazing i think we built an excellent staff and have come a long way i've been with the company since i was underage and felt i was treated well
good,A very nice place to start that puts basic skills to test. Will give you an idea if you can handle the nevironment or should push toward anotehr field. compunding minimum. IV room present and used full time. Control room present. prepacking machinery present.
good,"I've worked for CVS Caremark for over 10 years now and throughout that time, I've had several instances of poor leadership. The leaders are great at what they do from a industry knowledge standpoint  but their leadership skills are horrible. They lack leadership, coaching and development skills, sensitivity training and management 101. There is no accountability at any level. If you are good at your job then you are allowed to treat peers as well as leadership poorly. It's often uncomfortable."
good,"working at CVS was great and the pharmacy team was amazing and I enjoyed going to work every day - the Pharmacists were great and learned a lot in the 3 years I was there "
good,"A typical day consist of stocking and keeping merchandise neat. I've learned smart decision making, teamwork, and leadership. The management is excellent I've learned many things that are helpful to many job positions. The hardest part of the job is truck day. Its the busiest day of he week. The most enjoyable part of the job is being productive and getting the job done before closing."
good,"I really enjoyed working there, CVS is a great place to work. I learned more about healthcare. The opportunities are endless and they make sure to keep you up to speed with their guidelines."
good,Working in a pharmacy is crazy. It's very fast paced and a little stressful. Employees were nice but the customers were often hostile and upsetting. Not bad if you can get passed that.
good,"Good company but work/life does not matter, especially during the last 2 months and first 2 months of the year. Huge company that you get lost in with none of the departments talking to each other."
good,Long hours and hard to work part-time. Consists with a lot of stocking and your the only one working the cash register usually. Sometimes have to deal with unreasonable customers
good,A typical day at work is very busy with getting orders processed and tickets dropped for delivery to the branch timely. I have learned quite a great deal regarding exactly how the enteral department works and the importance of getting the patients serviced.  Some of our patients do not have the option to eat by mouth and it is up to us to ensure that they receive the necessary formula and/or supplies to receive the necessary nutrition. The upper management department unfortunately is not the way that it should be but with some organization and the right people in those roles I see them being great. The hardest part of the job is when the insurance has been verified and the services needed are not covered by their insurance and the customer does not have adequate income to pay for what is needed and then has to go through being transitioned to another company that may possibly be able to service them which further delays the patient being serviced. The most enjoyable part of my job is the joy in knowing that our patients were taken care of and are satisfied with the service that Coram provided them and would refer us to another company for their enteral needs.
good,"I loved my team (coworkers). I loved our Pharmacy manager, but the people on top, have different vision of the world. Their goal is far from the reality. They want really good customer service but they keep cutting our hours. They want us to attend to every customers needs, but if we don't have time to do our job (typing or filling prescriptions or what not) then, we cannot  satisfy our customers. Part of the job is being able to multitask. You have to be able to listen to what's going on in your surroundings while doing something else, like ringing up a customer on the register.  But the team i worked with made my stay there worthwhile."
good,"Alright job, very demanding for little pay as a tech. Great for students going into the medical field, will learn about medication and their names, brand & generic. Customers are #1 priority, those in store over the phone. Management is good as long as scores (via surveys on receipts) are high or at 100. Customers may get unhappy and rude, think its you that's denying medication and not understand its insurance or too soon to fill. Speed and accuracy is important. At my particular store, seems like there's cliques, they all talk about each other. If your pharmacist doesn't perform well, you're screwed. TEAMWORK is important although it doesnt always happen."
good,How this job goes all depends on your location and managers. It is a very difficult job because of the customer service aspects. Must have thick skin to deal with many customers. Try and find a good location.
good,CVS Health is a great place to learn about modern corporate culture with an emphasis on improving the lives of the it's customers and valuing diversity.
good,"great jobs and very good training classes, people and managers are very friendly and helpful.never had a problem with being able to talk to someone about my job position and scheduling"
good,The environment was unique and works are definitely diverse. But management would show favoritism time from time. The hours were a little hard to work but other than that the company is fine.
good,"I enjoy the people I work with.  My Pharmacists are good to work for. "
good,"The days were pretty hectic, very fast paced work and must be done efficiently. The hardest part of the job would be miscommunication with patients and being yelled at. The management could be better, very thing was set as a priority and it was hard to distinguish which is a higher priority in some cases. People would call out and it would be very stressful."
good,"this is a busy fast pace environment , nice helpful staff and pharmacists. clean work environment. can be stressful because its very busy and breaks are very sort. pay is low."
good,"I enjoyed working for CVS, it was an innovative company that focused on the health of its patients. The company was competitive and prepared its employees for movement up the ladder."
good,Main goal was to geneate revenue while staying within the law and their set guidelines.  12-16 hours on your feet with minimal rest and few bathroom breaks is difficult.
good,CVS has turned into a company that believes their employees are robots. There is not enough hours scheduled to get tasks done. Pay isn't that great if just starting out. I feel like they honestly don't care about their employees.
good,Good experience so far. Great company to work for. Awesome values and culture. Convenient location due to the fact that it is not in the city (minimal traffic). Lots of opportunities
good,"Meeting all patients, ordering meds, inventory and quality control of medications, always continuing education, scheduling, and helping customers get what they needed"
good,"CVS Pharmacy trains their employees for a fast-paced environment. They encourage their staff to go above and beyond to show exemplary customer service. They greatly value customer's feedback, and strive for constant improvement."
good,Was going through training at the time temporary position.  This was an temporary position as I stated.  There was intense training and test to take afterwards.  Students were tired but had to keep moving because it was a lot to learn in various applications.
good,Great place to work if your young and ambitious with no family.  Now that I'm a Mom the long commute/hrs are making it difficult to sustain a happy work/life balance
good,This place is very welcoming and would love to come back but it can get over welling at time with a lot of customers and having to call many places all at once. The managers are always nice as well.
good,"Content training could be reviewed and revamped to allow a better understanding based on age, learning perspective and previous experience. Good Recognition for some employees,  however, should assure not same employees that all should be considered. Open communication with all regardless of call type."
good,"Productive/Good Employees: We (Employees) work hard and try our best to accommodate each customer's needs. "
good,"Very dynamic, fast-paced, and chaotic organization. Weekly minor code changes. Bi-monthly Major code changes. This creates an environment that demands a lot of technical support, but the support functions and staff are second class citizens. It takes a special person with high tolerance for change and below average processes and procedures. "
good,"This job has made me who I am today. I am independent. A leader. I learned patience is a virtue. Everyone is fighting a different battle, be compassionate."
good,CVS pharmacy was an incredibly large learning experience for myself. The overall atmosphere was very welcoming with a staff that was nothing short of spectacular.
good,Great Company very fast paced environment. Always changing concerned with numbers overall then employees. Not many work hours for pharmacist or technicians. Might not get a break because stores are busy.
good,It can be fun place to work at times.They have  cut hours so much that it is very difficult to get numbers that the company wants.It is so sad it used to be a very nice place to work.
good,"you greet customers "
good,"The management was encouraging, but the young adults who worked there were rewarded for their missed work...with more work! Totally backward."
good,underpaid and no real room for advancement unless you get more years of experience under your belt. they are not patient while you learn the system either.
good,"It's an okay place, good pay and work life balance. The only suggestion I would have is better training for those with little experience. Sometimes it can be stressful."
good,"Entered this job as a contract position and really enjoyed it, had a very professional feel to it. They gave us our papers back saying that our contract was up but that instead they would hire us all on as full time employees instead of being contract but then last minute they said our contracts were over and only gave us a 1 week notice before our jobs were over."
good,Just running the store and assisting employees and customers. When you face issue and try to your ability to provide good service.
good,"I enjoyed working for Omnicare because you are constantly working. There is never any down time and your work is always being reviewed for productivity. The hardest part of the job is that we have to complete billing daily and if my team was slacking I was the one chosen to carry the load. The positive side to it is, my supervisor always knew who was being productive and who was not. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to listen to music which made the day go by faster. A typical day at work includes data entry, data entry and more data entry and I love to type. I also enjoyed interacting with various insurance companies to resolve billing discrepancies."
good,My first tech job and i was promoted to lead tech in a year. The benefits are good and match very well for 401K. I personally had less than pleasant experiences with management at times i.e they submitted all of my vacation hours without my request when i planned to use them for a certain trip.My boss was very flexible with my school hours and made it easy for me to customize my schedule in order to meet my hours. Upper management cares about numbers more than patient health and you will get graded on EVERYTHING-even things beyond your direct control.
good,"The company itself could use allot more improvement. It needs to listen and honor its members emotional and physical needs. While there are reasonable accommodation, the company does fall short on providing adequate care for their employees."
good,"It was fun working at the Auburn location. The team members were great. This was a fairly busy store, but we as a team pulled it together to give the customers/patients exceptional experiences."
good,"Info sec is under funded made it hard to complete your job. Needs a better budgeting process for IT."
good,"This is a really great place to work, benefits are good, people are nice, but the management can use some work. It always seem as if a manager is never around when needed."
good,Cvs health was a great place to work. Cvs health offered self promotions annually. Also quarterly bonus checks. The overtime was always available. They always provided incentives for going above what was required.
good,This is a great starter job and if you're look for a pharmacy job it is great. They provide plenty of opportunities to advance in the career. I personally like my manager but I know that's not the case for every CVS.
good,"The work is continuous, and job security. The work environment  continues to change. the hours are good for single parents. CVS is always willing to work with my school schedule."
good,Filled prescription orders by packaging and repackaging medications to be shipped to rehabilitation and long term care facilities. I enjoyed working as a team.
good,"In my days of working in Cvs pharmacy i learned to be a leader. I learned to become a better speaker and handle schedules. Though it was not really Enjoyable working there, i have made alot of connections. My co workers were pretty professional, kind and caring people."
good,"I learned a great deal in this job place. It was so busy that you are always doing something and you learn how to be quick, careful and multitask."
good,"A typical day is anything but typical, expect anything and everything, especially when people want their drugs. I learned so much about all these name brand drugs and generic ones as well. Management, was amazing and my co-workers were fun to work with and always teaching me new things. Hardest part of the job was satisfying the customer without breaking any regulations. Best part of working in a pharmacy was all the different characters you meet. Like I said earlier you can expect anything and everything to happen in a pharmacy."
good,The work is flexible with your schedule. Cool people to work with. I learned more about diversity because I work in Miami Beach and there is a lot of tourist.
good,"A typical day at work is unpredictable. Some days it's busier than others but it's always a productive day at work and time flies. "
good,One can learn a lot from this company. This company deals with long-term pharmacy care for clients living in residential care homes and assisted living.
good,"Awesome co workers , high volume of calls , assist with cancer PT that inquire the medication that needs refill , speak to doctors ,fax and email doctors"
good,Greeting and meeting new people. Helping people with their health and benefits. The most enjoyable part of this job is helping people.
good,"not bad enjoyable. slow and steady. short breaks. barely work with management. other than that...really no complaints. great pay, holiday pay is amazing if you're in the union"
good,"It feels good to provide excellent customer service but even great customer service can't please certain people who take meds for mental disabilities. That's where there's a problem. It gets stressful at times when the you get cursed out not because of you, but because either they have fake prescriptions or because their insurance doesn't cover a med that they really need."
good,Your pharmacy will be understaffed most likely and breaks will be highly discouraged. You'll also most likely be given more hours then you originally were told and do more then what was in the job description like baby sitting and pointing people to the bathroom.
good,"Between ordering stock, waiting on customers, doing planograms, putting up sales stickers, and unloading the truck, along with many other responsibilities and tasks that had to get done, CVS offered a lot of variety in the workplace."
good,I really enjoy working here and I've learned a lot over all the time I've been here. absolutely love my co workers and it's what keep me here.  The benefits are good and what you learn is good but the money is very poor and employees definitely deserve a lot more money for what they have to do and deal with here.
good,I love the job and the patients. A typical day at my store is pretty fast paced and busy. My job can be very stressful meeting the promised time to fill prescriptions for patients. Eating before coming to work is a must. There is not much time for breaks on a busy day.
good,"Fairpoint has some very skilled employees, unfortunately about two weeks after joining the sales department, the Company went on strike, and some potential opportunities that were described to me disappeared. As a result, it became a serious challenge. That is to say, Fairpoint needed to make some changes, but my timing was not very good. The management is talented, but became distant. I enjoy working with customers and carriers in this industry."
good,"Great Co-workers, managers, and district managers"
good,"Started as pharmacy technician and work up to become a licensed pharmacist. I learned a lot of things like processing data entry, inventory management, insurances, verifying prescriptions and learning the whole system. "
good,I get to interact with patients. Constantly learning new drug application from literature and patients alike. work environment could be improved. My colleagues the best
good,"If you enjoy being cursed at by customers-- Work for CVS. Besides the horrible pay, and fun days of work, most of the employees I work with have been there 15+ years."
good,"I have worked for CVS for almost 7 years. The first year, our store did not have the hours to provide me with more than 10 hours a week. Recently, I have 40 hours but overtime is a HUGE no, unless specified from the district managers. You rarely can get a steady hour schedule, it bounces around (unless you have seniority). However, it does give flexibility in home and school schedules. "
good,"great driver unity, driver friendly, AT stores-  management is good,we do two loads a day, maybe 2 to 4 stores average, best part is weekends off, hardest is waking up at 230 am ."
good,"Pro's: Four hour work days"
good,Great company for advancement but on the other hand you have put in overtime in order to make good living. Management has open door policy for any personal or work related needs.
good,Good location. Nice small company. I would work here again. Great benefits and compensation.  A lot of room to grow and relocate if you want that option.
good,Typical steady work day. Pharmacist instruction was good leaning experience. Changed management more than usual but co- workers worked as a team. The hardest time is at the end of the day. Overall nice working environment.
good,Very interesting work due types of clients supported. CVS Health is innovative in how money can be made in the managed care space. Management is open and hears out employees.Great co-workers.
good,"This was a great company to work for. The environment was relaxed and the other associates were easy to get along with. However, corporate set such high expectations that it was near impossible to reach the goals expected as an individual and as a store."
good,"Great staff and pharmacist in charge. The Pharmacist in charge has been the same pharmacist I have worked with for 20 years. I'm grateful for the ampule amount of pharmaceutical knowledge I've gained as being a lead pharmacy technician. I'm the insurance specialist and inventory manager. In retail settings there are so many various experiences and situations you get that can be anywhere from awesome, strange, insane, stressful, or just plain awful. Excellent customer service skills is needed in this profession and I have 20 years of experience in this department. I've learned that patience is heavenly required to work in retail. I loved the position of Lead pharmacy technician, but I admit I think the company is more focused on numbers/scores than customer service. I believe that due to excess amounts of required tasks and paperwork and scores, the pressure has been overwhelming. The time that could be used to deliver a positive overall excellent customer service is sadly taken away due to poor corporate management. Pharmacy technician hours are constantly cut. Pharmacy equipment and computer systems are not the greatest. While CVS is a leading provider in drug stores in the nation, they tend to forget that its the pharmacists and technicians that make them the leading provider. Pharmacists and technicians need to be more appreciated."
good,"I love working here, but overall there is no room for advancement."
good,"The pay rate is great.  Management is less than adequate.  The decisions they make seem like they make them up as the day goes by.  The people are descent to work with but you barely get to know them due to the high standards.  Also there isn't any time to use the bathroom since standard time does not allow for it.  Management says they give adequate time for this though.  I wonder if they hold their urine?  Employees are forced to hold their bladder or face the possibility of losing their jobs.  Don't get me wrong by my criticism of the management.  Some of them are really decent individuals but they have forgotten that humans are humans.  Also management believes that employees should not have the capability of making any mistakes.  If you make more than basically three picking errors in a nine month period, your fired."
good,"A typical day at CVS Pharmacy is a day of chaos, fun, and a roller coaster of highs and lows. The company overworks their employees until they quit. CVS has bought out many of their competitors and  the others have lost their customers to CVS due to bad insurance policies and out right not accepting medicaid patients. The way CVS handles all the new patients is by cutting hours and not paying Technicians what they deserve. There is  usually two technicians and a pharmacist handling hundreds of prescription orders, along with countless customer complaints because of the slow service, inventory, filling prescriptions, drop off orders,pickups, customer questions, doctor calls, and customer calls all running at the same time. The pharmacist usually isn't any help either because the cooperate office has them swamped with paper work and numbers. The pharmacy is really ran by the technicians. The coworkers are great to work with. Although they are very overworked and stressed, they are always willing to help anyone they can and don't get a lot of credit for keeping the pharmacy running."
good,"CVS/Pharmacy is where I initiated my career as a pharmacy technician. I learned all the basics here and began to expound on the knowledge that I was gaining. I learned everything from patient service/customer service, insurance billing, medication contraindications, SIG code, etc. CVS was truly my foundation."
good,"If you don't mind traveling from location to location, this place is really a nice place to work, they love to promote from within they are every good about schedules and really good about communication. I just wish there was one in the Indiana side of the bridge."
good,"Responsible for the daily operations of the pharmacy department. This includes supervising all pharmacy staff, verifying prescription orders, maintaining inventory, patient counseling, education, and adherence to medication as well as monitoring for adverse drug events and overdosages. I am also responsible for collaborating with other healthcare professionals to manage patient care and providing customer service."
good,"Good company to work with. System can be easy to work with. Sometimes it is short with staffing issues, which can be difficult. There is room to grow with the company. Has to be able to multitask well."
good,Great management and fun place to work. Management are always teaching us how to be a good customer service rep. The bad thing is that sometimes they give us less hours than the total that some us us were told when hired.
good,"Cvs is very flexible in terms of scheduling, most work with you if you have another job or are currently in school. There are many hours available to work including weekends and holidays. Management is okay depending what store you work in. For the most part it can be a bit dull and customers especially the elderly visit regularly can be a hand full but if you maintain a positive attitude you will be fine."
good,"I see 25-30  patients a day. I work alone in a retail setting. I see acute illness, physicals, wellness checks, and vaccinations. I enjoy educating the patients on their illness to help them understand what is happening within their body."
good,"They have a speedy promotion system and give you the tools to get there within 90 days!"
good,"- Easy going environment"
good,multi-tasking. Enjoy keeping busy. It's all about team work there. Management is good. The hardest part is just keeping yourself organized but other than that the job is good.
good,"Learned very much, filling prescriptions, how to type prescriptions, how to deal with insurance companies, great co-workers,"
good,"I enjoyed working for CVS HEALTh however, my supervisor seemed to still have the mindset of a high school freshmen with favoritism nepotism and disregard for how to supervise."
good,"Great opportunity to learn and grow in the retail pharmacy sector.  Range of patient demographics within each district, wide array of consultation opportunities."
good,Fast pace pharmacy environment with a heartfelt focus on impacting the community. They're changing the role of pharmacist nationwide. Great company to learn from.
good,"We get really good benefits, we play different games such as football, basketball, etc. I am in the new process of learning different things that are relating to my career."
good,"An average day at CVS really depends on the location of the store, I have worked at several other stores and they are different. Whether it's the customers or employees of that particular store."
good,Omnicare is a great place to work if you have good work ethics.  Non management is getting to feel more secure although at one time everyone was in a perpetual state of fear of losing their job.
good,"I enjoy working for CVS and believe it is a good company to work for, however, being that the store is seasonal, it limited my work and therefore has been quite detrimental to my income. I learned different techniques with the company's workflow which differed from my previous employment with Walgreens. Co-workers were not as helpful in the training process of learning workflow and techniques. Almost felt as if they were bothered by questions instead of assisting in training. The good aspect of the company is that even though I came to them as an experienced technician, they do provide a training program and classes in which a company technician trainer instructs and educates about the company and all areas of being a pharmacy technician."
good,there's never a typical day at work for everyday is different filled with challenges and figuring where to place everything into the spaces we have. I've learned that work and never get involved in other peoples dramas in the work place I do my job to the best of my ability. Management is the back bone of your system and they guide us to do our absolute best in providing the best customer service possible. The hardest job is not having enough time in the day sometimes to accomplish all that needs to be done even if you prioritize but I try my absolute best everyday. Most enjoyable part of my job is working with some pretty awesome people and assisting each other in being the best we can be
good,I loved the pharmacy staff and the patients . Very fast paced enviroment and lots to learn. Learned everyday a new task thanks to some of the older techs or lead techs. The hardest part of this kind of job is having to inform the patients that they have a huge decutible and then in turn that makes them not able to get their medication or the antibiotic because they could be on a fixed income or they just can not afford it at the time for what ever reason. But one of the more rewarding things is helping them figure out their insurace issues and then they are able to afford their matienace medication or that important eye ointment or flu medication.
good,"It is a lot of hard work. You have to be able to catch on VERY quickly as when we are doing our jobs we do not like to stop and answer questions. You have to be able to deal with very impatient people and also people who do not understand a pharmacy. Basic math skills are required, but I carry a calculator around with me at all times."
good,"On a typical day at work there would be numerous of notifcation for many prescription updates. I learned and managed my time of being able to learn and work at the  same time, due to management not able to keep track of certain, but most important training. The co-workers were very helpful you had what they called ""Semes"" to walk around and assist with emergency questions. The hardest part of the job was trying to remember each drug classification once systems were down. The most enjoyable part of the job being able to learn a new skill."
good,"Working at CVS is a choice for those who don't mind dealing with a fast paced work environment. You must be dependable and have flexible hours, with the ability to multi-task at all times. Co-workers are very friendly and courteous and the management is nice but could be fine tuned just a bit. The hardest part of the job is trying to always keep the customer happy, and everyone knows that that's impossible so work with passion and love what you do or else you will be miserable here.     I enjoy the customers who care that we aren't just robots who can be harassed and pushed around. I love to make people happy and try hard to put a smile on their faces even though a majority of people picking up medications are having the worst day of their life!"
good,Not much room for advancement and the hours can fluctuate.  Not a very rewarding experience. Stocking shelves etc.  Hard to move up in the company quickly.
good,"I feel CVS is a very good company from a customer standpoint, but I find it difficult to work for as a pharmacist.  "
good,"Worked for this company for 20 years in a variety of locations.  Like any chain pharmacy, your day is very dependent on your support staff.  Management tries to do what they can, but it all comes down to the bottom line, as to how many Rph and tech hrs you're allowed."
good,Currently I work with Prior Authorizations with Insurance companies and Doctors offices for Patients. I fill forms for doctors to complete and submit to insurance companies for them to approve payments for patient specialty medication. I also take inbound and make outbound calls to insurance and doctors offices. What i started out doing and still do as needed is take inbound calls from patients to refill their specialty Pulminary Hypertension medication. This requires a basic understanding of the disease and the benefit of the dispensed medication from our specialty pharmacy. We manage all of this my 2 programs called CATS and HBS.
good,"-Friendly co workers"
good,"Over the course of my employment with Camp Management Corporation, additional job duties were added to my job description (for which I was amply compensated).  However, I felt that all of those duties should have been shared by more than one person (as is the case now) and found that it was just too overwhelming and carried into my personal life."
good,There are two technicians receiving and typing prescriptions. Three technicians counting. One technician working the drive thru. Two pharmacsits. I learned how to multitask very well working here. I worked at one of the busy locations.
good,"I love working with people, helping customers and being very friendly and give the best care to customers/patients. I have been in the Medical Field for over thirty years. I believe in treating customers with respect. I did get alone well with the other Pharmacy Technicians, but I felt they could have done a better job in customer service. The hardest part of my job was getting the Pharmacist to do a professional job, getting prescriptions out on time after we would fill them and being courteous to the customers. The most enjoyable part of my job, as I stated above, I love working with the public. Assisting customers as needed and just being friendly. I have a very outgoing personality. Another hard part I had to face when leaving my job, was leaving the customers that I have gotten close too."
good,"very busy and fast paced not worth the pay. their is alot to learn and no time for anyone to teach you, so you learn as you go."
good,I began my day at 5:00 AM everyday. I operated a machine that kept a production rate of 12500 meds/day. I started everyday alone until my coworkers arrived around 8:30 AM. By the time they arrive they help me keep the machine replenished and give me chances to take a lunch break. The hardest part of the job was keeping the production going when the machine would malfunction or require maintenance. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers and the relationships I built in my 5 year tenure with the company.
good,"Omnicare is one of the better companies you can work for if you just want to work 40 hours and go home. There is not any inrichment of knowing you are impacting your customers and no forseeable advancement plan. Omnicare says they promote within but tends to hire outside for management. You can move around internally fairly seamlessly, but again these are not advancements, just latteral moves. Co-workers have been some of the best I have ever had. Management is flexable, and some of the best benifit options like 401k, employee stock, etc. The down side is that Omnicare seems to like to reinvent the wheel by trying the same things over and doesnt learn from the experiences. I would always tell someone to submit their resume here for a position."
good,"Overall this was a good company. It always strived to improve patient outcome with various ways like patient compliance, and counseling.  The benefits were excellent.  Great year end bonuses were given.  Some of the employees were not reliable or trust worthy"
good,"I enjoyed the staff.  The pay wasnt great and it wasnt bad, benefits were ok as well.  Great schedule monday-friday."
good,"Work on a daily basis consisted of helping others, including employees, to find what they needed. In the process of doing so I also provided product knowledge to those who needed it. Most of my co-workers were very pleasant to work around, because I treated them with the same respect I wanted a person to treat me with. I cant say I found a hard part to my job because I always sought out to find the best solution for things. The part I enjoyed the most was the feeling you got when you make others happy by helping them with their wants and needs."
good,"There was a steady work flow .  I leaned alot of computer programs .I also learned about manged care .  Management was a little annoying , my co-workers were nice people. The hardest part was keeping up with the quotas. I enjoyed the bonus of keeping up to the quotas."
good,"12 hour shifts, but can be rewarding, very busy pharmacy but is run well"
good,"We had the best supervisor team we complemented and worked together well with  each other, each having our strong points we worked and listened to each other weather we were working through a issue or setting up our work day. "
good,"flexible hours, great co-workers, learn something new every day"
good,"Mostly busy with less assistance .Co-workers were friendly The hardest day was working without enough Tech."
good,"I started as a sales associate, then started classes to earn my certificate as a Pharmacy Technician. As a Pharmacy Tech I would take prescriptions, type them and insurance into the computer system, count pills, sticker bottles, and run the cash register. At first I enjoyed this job and the money as well, but after about half a year it became very repetitive and boring to me. Seeing I was doing the same exact thing every single day."
good,"Typical work days were 8 hour shifts, with a 30 minute unpaid lunch making the effective work week 37.5 hours for full time. Typical work weeks ended up reading 42.5 to 45 hours, however, because nobody ended up taking their breaks. The workload was heightened to such an unattainable standard that many employees would team up and stay 30 minutes past their shift (or come in early) and gladly give up their time off the clock in order to work for the ""Team."""
good,A typical day would be coming into the office and setting up my work  station before my shift starts. Work was mostly Organizing and completing calls in the am then data entry and Insurance processing in the early afternoon. Hardest part was working almost remotely in a cubicle doing repetitive work with very minimal interaction. I learned a lot about prioritization and calendar planning. I did enjoy the shift I worked and the occasional outside project from management.
good,Morning shifts I start off by processing photo orders o be ready for customer pickups.Then some front store cleaning and product recovery to the sales floor. Greeting customers as they come in our store. Management enjoys the days that I am on their shift for I can handle all situations and customer service on my own. My co-workers feel that they can complete their job task more effectively when I am around. There is not really a hard part of the job due to me having confidence in what I know about my duties and my confidence to want to learn more. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers who make me feel like coming to work and the customers that was once difficult become repeat customers.
good,"A typical day at work starts off pretty slow but depending on what sales we have going on we tend to be pretty busy. There is always something to be done like price changes, outdates, product withdrawals, damages, etc. The management is excellent. Co-workers are always great to be around we all get along very well. The hardest part about the job is dealing with certain situations with customers especially when they don't agree on how the policy is. What I enjoy most about my job is it's a friendly environment and I've gotten along with everyone there."
good,"Good company to work for to gain experience. Good co-workers, good benefits, such as insurance, stock options, 401k etc"
good,The hardest part of the job was learning how to read the prescriptions.
good,You learn a lot of information and training when you have the right manager to guide you
good,"The manager in charge was very excellent at scheduling and made sure everyone worked as team. The morning were smooth and steady but during 4-6pm the busy hour at drive-thru and pick up required everyone to be accurate, fast and steady. The co-workers were one of the best, I have still kept in touch with most of them."
good,"i come in and according to where im station to be i enter scripts in the system. i find them on the shelves. i count out the meds. i call insurance compainies if i need to and i rung out patients, i have learned everyone you work with is NOT your friend. The hardest part of my job was trying to keep i store scores up. the most enjoyable part of my job was that i got to meet new people and help the needed."
good,"Overall, the fast paced environment calls for quick and fast movement and long hours behind the counter. As a retail chain, the issue is not gaining customers, but rather providing enough staff within the pharmacy to complete the various tasks. Trying to provide excellent service to customers with an understaffed pharmacy is nearly impossible. However, I did learn a lot and gained a good amount of work experience that I will hope to apply to my future."
good,Productive and fun workplace. Enjoyed working for this company.
good,management had unrealistic view of the sales process.  Co-workers were not team oriented.  They prefer to take credit for things they did not do.  The most difficult part of the job was dealing with co-workers who were self centered.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers to secure infusion services for patients.
good,"CVS is very caring about their customers, and great customer service is recommended of the store and all of the employees."
good,"Some stores are easier than others, depends which one you work at, if its small than its going to be harder, if a 24hours than you just have to do register of you are cashier."
good,"working at CVS has it's ups and downs everyday is different. I love helping patience on to a better path of better health. although it has it's challenges, I love to get through them."
good,Its an okay place to work however I dont believe CVS values their employees with enough compensation and there is a lot of micromanaging
good,"this was my first call center job  , it had paid training and  challenging work. the c is for change  things are always changing evolving ans being reviewed .I learned a lot about dealing wit the many different needs of all the different callers. also it was beneficial to learn about personality types and how they react ."
good,CVS can be sweet sometimes and bitter at other times. i enjoyed working for this company for the short time i was there. i would recommend this job to those seeking retail experience or job experience in general.
good,"Typical day at work is Customer service at it's finest! There is multi tasking involved constantly/answer the phones/type scripts/fill the scripts/ be at the Register to ring people out/help people in the store with any needs they may have to locate an item/put medications on ready fill/I am the Specialist for the Machine in the Pharmacy that counts out certain meds for us so I am in charge to fill the meds as needed when there is a need for something/setting up Ready fills where Customers may want a phone call and not have to call in when they need their medication/I place the phone calls when something may not be available that day on the shelf, so I place orders for the next business day for delivery to our store and then proceed to fill what was needed and then call the Customers that it has arrived/or if there was any type of issue at all/I call people given to the Techs on a phone list to check with Customers if they still take medications that seem to be over due and not refilled. The hardest part of the job is to maintain all areas of the pharmacy but I manage to get everything done on a consistent basis and do all that is asked of me. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people with all of their needs and that they leave happy and satisfied and the Customers that come in are very nice. I am friendly and kind to everyone and do exactly what a Customer will ask me to do. Also, there are certain Customers that specifically call and only ask for me, and that makes me feel wonderful. I learned all areas of my job quickly and carried my customer service skills with"
good,"my typical day at work would consist of verifying insurance, updating accounts, answering incoming calls regarding claims.  complete daily reports, send outgoing faxes and out going mail."
good,"I have worked at CVS for over five years.  The job itself is not that hard (having great coworkers helps) but sometimes customers can be a pain (as I'm sure is the case anywhere).  A few times a year hours get cut drastically. Sometimes there are not enough people scheduled on a shift to get all of the work done that needs to be done.  Although CVS has a policy regarding returns, coupons, etc., this policy is not the same at all stores -- some managers really stick to policy while others don't and tell you to do whatever it is that will make the customer happy.  The most enjoyable part of the job -- to me, at least -- is all of the hands-on work (putting up delivery, pushing overstock to the sales floor, doing outdates, cleaning, etc... I really enjoy doing all of the tedious stuff that no one else likes to do)."
good,"A typical day is very challenging.. This organization does not offer the tools needed to service customers with excellence,, however the customers are amazing and very appreciative."
good,"A typical workday was very busy. I learned how to multitask and be very attentive as well as becoming a great listener and increasing my computer skills. The most difficult part of the job were the hours. We did many activities as a team, which helped us get to know one another."
good,"Upper management has treated me fairly and as manager you are able to choose and mold your staff to your needs.  However, you get what you put in, therefore the more time you invest into the details the better your day will be.  This is a retail setting so biggest focus is customer service.  You will run into tough customers but do not let that hinder you from providing great service because there are plenty of people who need and are very great full for it.  Hardest part of the job is finding balance between running a business (managing budget and employee hours) with filling prescriptions."
good,"Working for CVS Pharmacy, I learned that patient care is the most important thing in health care. I learned another side to management; I learned management of healthcare. Also, within CVS I was able to be a leader of 5 other individuals, manage schedules, manage drug inventory, and lead a team to work as a cohesive unit. The processes used within CVS taught me auditing procedures."
good,"Hard work daily every day. With cashiering, stocking shelves cleaning rooms,and answering any questions customers had you are sure to stay busy."
good,"Opportunities to learn a lot and advance in the company.  Fast paced work with a lot of responsibility.  Store was short-staffed and hours constantly being cut which worsened production.  Too much emphasis on using technicians as advertising tools when there is important work to be done. Too much emphasis on ""performance measures"" and statistics which were difficult to meet with the constant cuts in employee hours.  The company's motivations were driven mostly by money and not by providing quality service to it's customers."
good,"Typical day at work for customer service. Cleaning, restocking, sales,out of dates, photo lab."
good,Omnicare is a great place to work.  I love what I do because I make a difference. I have learned a lot from this employer. This job just does not pay enough for what I do and am highly unsatisfied with the pay. I believe I am worth more and my experience is worth more than the pay.
good,"Receive written prescription or refill requests and verify that information is complete and accurate."
good,after 9-10 hours of selection I can go home to my wife and rest up for another day of selection. Every day I try to be accurate as possible to keep our customers happy.
good,Branch worked well as a team to provide for the patients.  Enjoyable place to work.  Pharmacists provided care for patients of a set of physicians or area.  Developed positive internal and external relationships with customers.
good,"A day at CVS was really hectic since the moment you clock in to the moment we clock out.Phones ring non-stop. All pharmacy staff is helping patines either on the phone or in person, trying to satisfy their needs. I really enjoy meeting new people everyday."
good,The job focuses a lot on the customer and making sure that they are satisfied. The main focus in the pharmacy is adherence and making sure that the customers are informed about their medications and are aware of the importance of taking their medications as directed. I really love the job and the customers it's like second nature when I go to work I know what is expected and I'm comfortable their and able to get my job done with confidence.
good,i worked there while i was in school i loved how close it was to my house i walked there everyday to work. the people were always nice and i would work for the company again but as a manger not associate
good,"I love my job and coworkers, we all go above and beyond to make sure our patients are satisfied and well taken care of. The only downside to my job is that I am very under paid for the work and stress that I endure everyday."
good,Extremely large workload placed on pharmacy managers and are expected to accomplish more than what your team is capable of given the skeleton schedule you are dealt.
good,"In a typical day you will log in and take calls for the duration of your shift. Calls are related to the prescription benefit coverage that members have as part of their overall health insurance benefits. These benefits vary in composition from member to member. Information that would be discussed includes deductibles, out of pocket costs, copay's/coinsurance, etc. The co-workers are generally friendly and work to include every team member. Call volume can vary depending on the time of year, with January being the busiest. Management is open and knowledgeable and the help desk is available for assistance as well. Health insurance can be very complicated, especially if you have never spent much time educating yourself about it; I learned a great deal about health insurance but I can't say that it is in any way interesting at all, and it can be tedious to discuss and contemplate all workday long."
good,The most enjoyable part is talking with patients and helping them understand the medicines they are taking and meeting new people. The hardest part for me is the insurance and having to tell the patient why the insurance will not cover specific medications. I learn something new every day at my job.
good,"I always said that I would not work retail again.  Unfortunately, when my old position in an office setting was downsized I had to take this position because my unemployment was running out and the employment industry was in a bad situation. "
good,"My typical day at CVS Pharmacy was very slow paced. I always stayed at the front, being the cashier for most of the time. I felt there weren't very many customers. When I wasn't busy at the cash register, I would check the photo center to make sure I didn't have any photo's that needed to be developed. If all of this was taken care of, then I would stock store items.  I felt the management here was poor. He didn't associate with his workers very well and was not an understanding manager. I did like my co-workers, although I rarely seen them. This job was never really hard in my opinion."
good,A typical day at work is steady pace and friendly. You learn about medications and what they are for. All of my co-workers are friendly and easy to get along with. There is a lot of customer service involved with this job. The most enjoyable part of this job is knowing that you are helping people live healthier lives.
good,"It was a retail job and it really didn't cater to the field of study that I went to school for. But it was great for meeting people for references, and networking for other career opportunities"
good,CVS/Pharmacy is the largest pharmacy chain in America that I have worked for as a Pharmacist for 16 years.
good,"use to enter prescriptions into computer system correctly and fill prescription under supervising of a license pharmacy. answer phone call for customer and answer any issues or questions regarding refills, drugs not cover or if med was ready to be pick up. also due weekly/monthly report correctly and in a timely matter."
good,"I have worked for this company many years. When I first started the focus was on customer service with excellent prescription management. In recent years more of our time is spent on time consuming marketing and sales tasks, which are of course necessary, but should fall to corporate rather than the pharmacist who should be focused on their patients and medications."
good,I love my job and my coworker. Our pharmacy is always busy and filled with lovely customers.
good,"A typical day at work is stressful either way you look at it"
good,Typically I fill prescriptions. I type prescriptions and help customers. I also do the inventory items.
good,"After about four years of employment I must admit of all the retailers that I've had the pleasure of working for CVS/Pharmacy has to be the most fast paced. The ability to help customers maintain their lifestyle is truly amazing. My co-workers, both past and present, are more like family. I most enjoy helping customers prepare photo products that are adored by their families. Re-capturing lost relatives so future children can see where they came from makes my job that much more rewarding. Though I adore the customers, I do feel that the overall management of the company could be corrected. I believe that store employees aren't closely listened to in times of need and the voice of the employee can be greatly overshadowed by the voice of the customer. "
good," typical day at work"
good,I am typically busy from the time I start my work day to the end of my shift. I am constantly on the go with helping patients and my fellow co-workers.
good,"Very Stressful"
good,A typical day at work is filling of totes with product which I feel is not challenging. I have learned to pace myself to get good scores on getting my job done. I have also learned to be a better team worker.I have made good friends in my co-workers and enjoy working with them as a team. The hardest part of the job is getting adjusted to the fast pace. The most enjoyable part is it is fast paced so the time goes by quickly. Also we very rarely work weekends and do not work holidays. The pay is also good.
good,"It was the most stressful job I had EVER had in my life. My co-workers were great, and the head pharmacist was an incredible man. great moral values. Just wasnt enough hours available for me and I was way too stressed."
good,"regular customers are very nice to serve. Learned how to respect my co-workers and their habits. Management couldv'e been better with working out a work flow. Co-Workers had their own way to work, but was willing to be flexible. Hardest part of the job was working around the mess. Most enjoyable part was customers"
good,"Only two shifts, 7:00A.M. - 3:30P.M 3:30P.M-2:30 A.M"
good,"Very Busy atmosphere. Fasted paced, My co workers are great and helpful.Management could be a little better. The hardest part of the job I would is that when customers are being rude it can kinda mess up your day.The most enjoyable part is seeing friendly customers"
good,CVS Caremark is a good company with great leadership and intentions. Internal changes are very common regarding org structures.
good,Given sales goals and customer traffic the most difficult daily challenge was time management. Otherwise these stores are fairly simple to run and inventory manage as most directives come from the head office in the district. What drove me into this type of employment was the opportunity to help another person considering the close relation in the medical field.
good,"work with a lot of good people, difficulty to get raises, only got 3 raises in 5 years there, however I enjoy interacting with people and helping people out"
good,A typical day at work which is following work flow management schedule. Provide the best customer service. Follow the policy of the company. Help and motivate coworker if the work load is overwhelm.
good,Being management you feel like you end up living at the store. You start to feel exhausted and miserable and unhappy. You don't have time for school or your family.
good,"A typical day at CVS Distrubition Center was loading and unloading products tractor trailors, also worked on cherry pick trucks building pallets. I enjoyed it very much, as it taught me a lot of discipline and responsbility. I learned a lot about time management, and getting things done on the deadline. Management and co workers were good as well. Supervisors were socialable and easy to talk to. My employment lasted roughly 15 years, and I enjoyed it."
good,"I am responsible for high levels of customer service in order to successfully complete an Insurance referral. Job responsibilities include working directly with Insurance Companies, Pars and branches to obtain Home Fusion benefits for patients."
good,high volume collection calls and inquiries from medical providers and patients on a daily basis. I learn how to prepare myself for each task or assignment by getting my workload organized so that I can complete it within a timely manner. I'm a people person so my co-workers all loved me. I really did'nt have a hard job because I applied myself. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to different type of people and doing my job because I love doing it.
good,"Good place to work good people They make it very easy to work at this place, great training programs hard to make mistakes with all the checkpoints"
good,The experience there was terrific until the last 3-4 years after corporate merger.
good,"A typical day was coming in, standing behind the counter, and working on the register. I learned a new environment and a little about the pharmacy. Management was good. Co-workers were okay. The hardest part of the job was getting along and fitting in. The most enjoyable part was being back in the pharmacy."
good,It is a nice place to work however they have a lot of turn around.
good,"very low pay for a Pharmacy Technician, customers were nice, not a good work place."
good,Constantly something to work on. Same concept but new approaches for each situation daily. I learned to multi-task rather well and ways to interact with our regular customers more one on one.
good,"It is an good company to work for. Many differnet shifts. Must make dr calls in the morning, and manage techs and be able to multi-task"
good,- Flexible Schedule
good,"Having held two separate positions in CVS Caremark, I experienced a wide range of management and supervisory styles."
good,"The changes of different plans, inbound calls about web site, claim processing for pharmacy benefits for retail pharmacy. etc."
good,It pays the bills somewhat but is rather thankless and underpaid job. On top of the basic operations there is a lot of unnecessary fluff that is required by management. The most unnecessarily time consuming is having to call new customers to thank them for joining CVS. We are frequently pressed for time and requiring ex-strenuous fluff on top of that just increases the load and chance for mistakes. We should focus more on actually caring about the customers well being. Not just acting like it.
good,"A typical shift lasts for 6 hours, varying between an opening shift, 7-1, a mid-shift, 10-4, or a closing shift, 4-10. My duties as Customer Service Associate mostly involve answering customer questions, being friendly, checking out customers at the register, and keeping the store organized, clean, and running smoothly."
good,"Perform stock duties which are stock, merchandising, back-stocking, maintenance, shipping & receiving. I learned to perform pre-order as well as orders for the store. I can scan in magazines and other merchandise as well as scan out damages with RF Scanner gun. Management is mostly busy with office work but try to balance their floor management. My co-worker have work evenly portion amongst each other. Work quantity doesn't match up with the amount of workers which in results turns to be little pay for work we may perform. The advancement opportunities are a perk to the job."
good,"Great team to work with,but pay rate could be better. Great place for someone who loves to help customers."
good,Very busy environment. Fun activities to lessen the fast paced rerquiremnts of the job.
good,My overall rating would be three stars . The typical work day is very hectic and could be paced a little better however I mus tsay I had great coworkers and actually learned alot from working there.
good,"Working as a pharmacy technician is a job for a great multi-tasker. In addition to having great customer service skills, one must be competent and quick on your feet. One must be a problem solver, and be able to learn how to use the system efficiently. One must have knowledge of prescriptions sig codes and insurance information and policies. One must be professional and keep patient health information safe and secure. One must be neat and organized as an individual and as a team so that necessary documents are easily filed and located. All while on your feet running around, ringing up customers, and answering phones."
good,"Good management, company folded because of poor business decisions"
good,Do not question anything. Just do your work. Do not expect much and you won't be disappointed. If you have an incident be prepared to drive to the main office for what is alleged to be a resolution and at the conclusion receive your walking papers. Strictly a business you are strictly a number
good,I didn't help respected. The work went well for me  I did all that I could and got ratings up in 2 months. Felt I needed more credit. Usually went in worrying about getting in trouble but I loved my job. It is nice for people older aged and likes retail and customers
good,"I enjoyed working in a fast-pace environment like CVS. However, the job did not provide much clinical work as I wanted. Due to an increasing business, it tends to be understaffed"
good,It was a pretty good place to work at. I felt respected and appreciated. Pay is definitely not great but one can easily move up and do more and make more
good,nothing it was ok to work their wen i did  they are a really good conpany to work for wish i could have stayed their but ddue to the boss at the time i
good,"Can at times be very stressful, but rewarding when a customer is satisfied. Workload is often overwhelming but the employers are welcoming and adamant on helping employees."
good,"I did enjoy at first working for this company, but the staff at that location was not so friendly, specially when they had already made their circle of friends. I did enjoy keeping the patients satisfied. The hardest part of this job was too many scripts to be done in a day, sometimes it seemed impossible."
good,With the current and upcoming labor budget reductions it is difficult and will become more so in maintaining a good work/life balance.  It's a challenge to keep up with one's personal life because of the time spent working.
good,Typical day was good. I would check the system for all the prescriptions of the day and assist the pharmacist to the best of my ability. It was fun and interactive and I was able to help my patience.
good,"Stressful work environment, direct management cares about the employees."
good,"Working here was stressful  it was low staff, so everyone wanted you to do everything at once. The schedule was changed without your approval a lot of times and there was always changes. It was easy work though just a lot of stress because it was low staffed."
good,"Decent job unless you're trying to balance school and work. Overall customers are a bit more rude than other customer service locations, work is a bit boring too since it's very repetitive."
good,I would not recommend working here. Maybe it was just the location i was at but everyone was miserable and overworked everyday. You're only important if you've been with the company for 20 years. New employees are treated like garbage.
good,"Originally Omnicare was not a bad job, but like most takeovers/buyouts company policies change. Changes meant cutting funding so benefits went away and so did some jobs. Making other jobs stressful."
good,They have started caring more about the bottom dollar rather than employees or patients. They have changes the work load for each store making it almost impossible to completely do your job in a sufficient amount of time due to cuts in tech hours for each location. Increased demand+decreased hours = unhappy and stressed employees
good,Very busy store and very little help.  You can move up in the company if you are willing to give your own time and not be paid for it. I still had to work 40+ hours behind the counter as well as 20+ hours in management training.
good,Cvs is place to gain workplace experience.  Depending on where your placed and who trains you the experience can definitely motivate you to move up . However the hours are cut down to the minimum.you are required to do the work of 3 people as well as aid your pharmacy because some of the stores are understaffed.
good,For a beginner job this is an excellent start. You can advance if you work hard and express interest. Experience varies by location and the store manager and no two stores are the same.
good,CVS helped me become a pharmacy technician so that was good but other than that I would not work there again. I got 5 hours one week!!! And because there is no union they can do that! Also my manager was a jerk and raise reviews are up to them so I was making less than a girl who was there only 4 months and I was there almost 2 years! I wouldnt say its the worse place in the world though
good,"The training program is excellent. They really give you a chance to grow and learn, but then the store placement is pure luck. I was placed in a horrible location with employees that were stealing and high theft from customers."
good,Well I used to worked in Charleston for 5 and 1/2 years it was ok but working in Florence is better. I think the people and the environment makes a difference on your job. The pay is decent and most managers I had worked with me on my schedule.
good,"Process Cash Applications every minute of the day with expectations of entering one payment per minute no matter what type of payer you are entering.  Some payers have a lot of investigation needed in order to enter payments, of course, these payments, take a lot longer to enter.  I did like the work but it could be veryfrustrating."
good,"Learned a lot but ready for a new adventure!"
good,It’s an ok job to work for. The pay is ok. They don’t really teach you any real skills or anything. They care more about money then the employees. I remember the lights went out and they had us in there in heat for 8 hours. They rather make money then to make sure the employees are happy. It’s a demanding job when you’re in management too.
good,I have always loved my job up until this last few months when CVS decided to cut our hours back. I love the people I work with which makes it so much better.
good,Love the people I work with. Slow with the raises and not enough hours to go around. Corporate is constantly cutting hours down and expecting the pharmacy to run smoothly.
good,"A typical day at work would included multiple task such as customer service, production assistant. I have learned while working at CVS no matter how hard you try some customers we still be unhappy. I would consider the hardest part of the job is working with the public because some customers are mean and interact in a unprofessional manner. Although you have a few mean unsatisfied customers the other people you meet throughout your career are the best part. Some people you meet will impact you life!"
good,"If you are career driven and willing to work alot to become succesful, CVS is for you. The expectations are very difficult and sometimes depending on the volume of the store, impossible."
good,"-A typical day at CVS depends on the day and your shift time. A regular weekday morning-mid day will deal with handling transactions, coupon issues, putting away items from the truck, etc. An afternoon-closing shift will involve facing and cleaning the store, making sure that it looks good for the morning crew. A Saturday morning-mid day is the same as a weekday however, involved in the closing shift is putting up the new sale signs and taking down the old sale signs. Truck days will deal with taking items off the truck and placing them onto the shelves. "
good,"Not a bad place to work, you get a decent amount of time off along with decent pay. One of the big downsides is all the overtime during major holiday seasons."
good,A typical day at work involved filling prescriptions and getting customers what they need. Sometimes when not enough help is given it can get very stressful.
good,"CVS is a hard place to work for because they want you to do amazing work with a small staff."
good,"I worked as an intern, but i learned  lot, i could participate in learning the basis in that field. Is a little stressful, that allowed me to learn how to work in a fast space, without harming others. Respect was first."
good,Benefits are great.  Strenuous retail environment.  Too many requirements and not enough help.  Benefits are great.  pay for pharmacists is good but technician pay needs to be higher
good,A wonderful place of employment very fast pace and fun to communicate with the customers. very convenient for me in the area. the commute to work is easy and fast. Great benefits
good,No work life balance as a manager due to the number of payroll hours that the stores are given. The manager gets paid for 45 hours but has to work to make up for hours that aren't covered
good,"⦁	Stock, pricing and ordering"
good,"As a manager everyday is different, but the pattern of the day is still the same. It can get a little boring. The pay is great if you do not have to pay rent or live with parents,or just need a few extra bucks for Christmas."
good,"I got hired into the distribution center and it seemed like an easy job, which it was. But recently they changed to pulling 4 orders from a taplet which again was easy BUT they expect you to be pulling at 100% which when you’re new is unfair. They never kept me in one area so I had to get use to the product and how many came in a pack if I had to cut it open etc. I would get use to it and I would be moved again. In one area I was hitting 95% but I wouldn’t be kept there. On probation if you don’t hit 100% in your first 6 weeks they let you go. So I was let go. I tried arguing the fact that I was bounced around and they didn’t care. I wanted to stay here it’s a good paying job just get it was unfair"
good,"My time at CVS has been a learning experience.  I had one manager who was active with my training and advancement at CVS. "
good,Great environment to learn how pharmacy's prepare medication and how to interact with a variety of people. I learned patience and how to deal with different attitudes.  Everyone respected each other.
good,The company benefits were great...travel accommodations were amazing...upscale hotel & meal accommodations and even child care when traveling...overtime perks were quadruple...schedules were flexible.
good,"trabajo de mucha presion y cambios de horario laboral por fluencia en distribucion."
good,The people I work with in store are like a family to me. The higher ups can sometimes not be realistic with their demands. But I house people have each other's backs.
good,if you were hired as a runner and you are a licensed and certified tech you will never be able to move to another department unless your back stabby and underhanded going behind the managers backs.
good,"The store I work at is very busy! Always a customer to help, but no downtime to work on inventory paperwork. Don't love that Pharmacy Techs are the only Cashiers. This makes getting all the prescription processing done a challenge. My management team is great though.  Always willing to work with scheduling."
good,"Cvs gives the advantage of getting your license after been hired but the low pay, stressful environment, and the high load of work placed upon employees ( few employees ) make it difficult for to stay and prefer to look for other opportunities"
good,You will be paid very little and will advance very slowly. Most pharmacies are very busy and overworked. For the first year they probably won't give you full time hours so that they won't have to give you benefits.
good,Times were stressful on busy days but overall the experience for mellow and comfortable. Management showed empathy towards their employees and helped us understand things whenever we were confused or didn't understand something.
good,"Worked as a technician for 2 years, they had benefits but raises don't happen and little to no advancement opportunities. I suggest to make sure you get your desired salary at hire. Also was promised advancement but was constantly disappointed."
good,I would come into work at 4 pm everyday and work from 4-10. i would come in and check all what i have to do for the day. then go drive the meds to nursing homes after i check them. then after that ill come back to the store and work the main cashier.
good,"CVS keeps its pharmacist too busy.  Timing how long it takes to "
good,"Typical day at CVS is cycle counting, audit safe drops, change weekly tag, stock shelfs. Ive learned utilization of rapport building skills to draw back repeat customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers and make them feel valued. We do not know what the customer is going through and to be the reason that they leave with a smile is an extraordinary feeling."
good,"I enjoyed the clean environment and the hiring process. They don't just hire anyone. I worked for a third party company, however, the location was pretty good."
good,"When I get into work, it's automatic go-time. Our drop-off station usually opens up with about 3-4 pages of 15 columns of prescriptions to be worked on. I usually am always at the production station. It's like my second home. On an average day, we'll have around 10 pages to be filled. That's excluding the prescriptions that we work on as customers bring them in throughout the day. I answer phone calls assisting patients in their healthcare. Easily resolve third party problems in an efficient time matter. Willing to help out in any way with my colleagues to make workplace a fun and and great environment. The hardest part of the day would definitely have to be with our new order comes in every day. Just takes up a lot of time trying to figure out why things didn't come in and letting each customer know every customer know their situation accordingly. The most enjoyable part of the day is when I have the satisfaction knowing I finished my work at production but not only that, I also killed it."
good,Great company and work place. Company is constantly growing and expanding their market share. If you live in Rhode Island this is the company to work for.
good,"long working hours, very stressful especially dealing with multiple insurance companies, drive through was stressful. Technicians worked hard. Hard for pharmacists to take a lunch or bathroom break."
good,"I liked the job, but there is quite alot wrong with it. for one Pharmacy techs do not get paid enough for the work they do. then there's the fact that corporate cuts hours way too much. also as a young, single male i got way too much taken out in taxes and benefits, and if you work in Ohio, union dues are taken out as well. management and other higher ups that work outside of the pharmacy are in control of everything but have no idea how things actually work which in the end screws the pharmacists and techs."
good,"Very fast paced, tough place to succeed and do well. Burn out is very possible for a pharmacist at CVS. If it weren't for the great pay for a pharmacist, the job would be totally unrealistic for the amount of effort you put in."
good,"I had great team and co workers. It made my day go by smoothly. I like the environment working in the pharmacy. I do love that I can multitask, type, answer phones, help customers, call and verify prescription with doctors, and insurances. I love variety . This is just my personality."
good,"CVS Caremark is a good place to work, friendly colleagues, helpful supervisors, but it is very slow to advance, worst part is the pay is not just wroth the whole stress. To cut to the chase: it is a glorified Factory"
good,I had a good job there. It took me a long time however to work my way up. My direct managers were always great. The supervisors were always pushing them to much and there was a high turn over. They defiantly didn't care about family life or seniority.
good,"The most satisfying part of the job as a health care provider is to improve job satisfaction, increase knowledge, and to make positive impact on patient care."
good,Fast paced job. Long hours sometimes and short hours sometimes. Good working enviroment. It is less than a half mile from a dandy. So can go there for your lunches.
good,"extremely stressful, extreme staff shortage, lots of opportunity for error if not extra careful, patient care suffers not enough time to discuss issues with patients"
good,"lots of work and hours The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to communicate and help patient on a personal level. It is a challenging job and would definitely required skills of multi-tasking. The work day is pretty constant with phones calls to insurance companies, patients, and clinics. The hardest part of the job is trying to do everything when you are alone and are needed at multiple places."
good,"CVS pays its pharmacists well and benefits are competitive, hours are flexible depending on partner pharmacist.  Downside would be tech hours are  set at a minimum so pharmacist does a lot of tech work, no additional help in vaccination season"
good,I love Cvs but lately it’s become all about money and not about the staff helping to make that money. They keep cutting back. It’s sad because customer service is the most important
good,A fast paced job where you adapt day to day. The same tasks are mandatory each week with a balance of providing excellent customer service. You are expected to put in the time to make your store successful and the hardest part of the job is not making it your whole life. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships created with your customers and colleagues.
good,"They are one of a few companies that actually are true about wanting to help employees and super friendly staff from employees to managers. Great growth potential and promotion is based on stats and not who you know or who likes you. Great benefits 401k match, employee stock program, tons of vaca, and flexibility."
good,I currently work for CVS . I'm not happy with the hours . Also the wage needs to increase . The staffing to short for the amount of work to be done. Which make a stressful environment to work in !
good,"The store I worked at was a bit slower than most.  You do get to know some of the customers after awhile.  Employees are a tight-knit group, most likely you would fit right in.  Because of the slow volume movement, would be fairly easy to handle the multiple operations.  lots of running around in the store with only few employees multitasking."
good,I learned more customer service and the register. My manager was very nice and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was how busy it was and how rude the customers were. The most enjoyable part of my job was my coworkers and my manager.
good,"there were good & bad days but working with my former employees made it overall a good time. i learned to be dependent, hardworking & willing to learn when the opportunity was given. the hardest part of the job was given duties yet they wanted them done as if you had a whole shift to do them in but you didn't plus you had to finish the slack of another. also when they would change your schedule without telling you or not give you your requested days off or vacation. don't get me wrong i loved the pay but with my former employees i miss the most."
good,"Was to help patients with the prescriptions needs from inputting to filling, ordering supplies etc, Mgmt was always accessible and helpful, the pharmacy team always rallied together during hard moments to get the work at hand done."
good,Typical day is to be in the office by 7:00 am. Bill electronically or manually until 12:00 pm for lunch for 1/2 an hour. Then go back to billing until 3:30 PM.  The manager helped me with questions about billing.  The workplace culture was very friendly to me.  The hardest part of the job was production.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the Welcome part of the year at the beginning of the year.
good,"Good place to work with very few issues. Recommend CVS to others."
good,CVS is a good place to work and it pays very well. The environment is not a fast paced as many call centers. The training is good as well. They make sure you know the material.
good,"Overall was a great job, but I wanted to grow with the company and learn and make a career out of it and this company just did not fit that goal of mine."
good,Cvs is an okay place to work if you are looking for something flexible. It can be stressful when there are so many things to get done and there is barely any staff especially during the nighttime.
good,"I believe CVS Pharmacy/Health is a great place to work. However, it is very fast paced and stressful. If one was not ready for this level of pressure, it can be a bit overwhelming."
good,"A lot of customer contact by phone, and internal contact. I enjoyed my time at this job.Helping people with there medications.Also with there Insurance coverage."
good,"Supportive learning environment in the enteral and durable medical equipment industry. I enjoyed the  investigative part of the job, learning payer requirements for submitting and obtaining prior authorizations. However, cross department communication is either horrible or non-existent. Lots of red-tape in the way of being productive and efficient. The office environment is casual, and on the verge of unprofessional."
good,"It really is a nice place to work. I was in logistics so I regularly worked at 4:00 am which after three years, became grinding. I eventually sought a career with better hours."
good,"dealing with angry customers and poor management fron the ""higher-ups"". good for a fast learning experience and you will become an expert at dealing with upset or angry customers."
good,"We use to have a relax environment until they wanted us to make more prescriptions per hour or was the end of the moth or end of the year and we haven't meet our numbers. But other than that stress moments , we have our breaks, 30 min for lunch, we do overtime if we want, they asked the ones who wanted and they used to gave us on Sundays donuts. We had our shifts and everything organized."
good,A good place to work but all that much. Management is good somehow. The only issue I wish they could solve is with the employees. The pay rate is really low for certain veteran pharmacy technicians.
good,"Works good independently"
good,"I like my job, and I love my co-workers, but the environment can be very slow paced at times. The managers are very nice, and I love talking with the customers."
good,hard work with not enough employees to do the jobs needing done. It is unsafe to have only 2 people in the store at a time all day. the store is too large to keep up when only 2 people are working alone. No one is held accountable by upper management in the pharmacy area for mistakes made.
good,"Working at CVS pharmacy has its up and down. I like to hope the order of prescriptions comes in on time so the customers won't be so upset. Other than that I enjoyed myself except for upper management stressing my manager for whatever reason.  I would still work there if they accepted me relocating to a different store. It has its up & downs, but it a nice place to work."
good,"I was a tech in the pharmacy.  Training was a overload. I worked 11 years at walgreens until they closed the store.  I understand going thru training but I think it should less for those who been in the field. "
good,"Busy you never have a dull moment."
good,Busy retail pharmacy fair pay and benefits but the computer system is outdated and you have to watch your pay to make sure management doesn't miss your hours worked.
good,"The quality of the job greatly depends on the store. Some pharmacists/ managers are much more fun than others. Script volume also widely varies, but some people prefer different work paces. Corporate micro-manages but doesn't seem to have a clue what happens day to day."
good,"Being a pharmacy technician at CVS can be stressful, but target patients make it worth it. The management team is always looking out for what is best."
good,trying gets you far but with so many obstacles in the company it get difficult to get promoted. some nepotism and that makes it unfair and discourages employees to try harder.
good,"My typical day consisted of ringing up customers, taking down and putting up sales tags and cleaning. I learned how to keep my area clean, do certain jobs required of me in the workplace, and resolve situations with customers on my own. The management at CVS was very laid back. They were the best crew I've ever worked with at a job. The hardest part of my job at CVS was dealing with difficult customers. I had to learn how to deal with them in a professional manner and learn how to handle difficult customers on my own. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to work with the people that worked there. We were like a family. If someone had a problem, they knew they could go to anyone who worked in the store and, whatever the problem was, it would be handled."
good,"Your work load may become hefty as a pharmacy technician, but effective communication with your team and customers and time management will make that load much lighter."
good,This employer has great job advancement and job training. You will be able to meet a lot of great people who can further your career. This employer also offers on the job training while you are in school.
good,"CVS is a great place to start out. They teach you many skills to acquire better attributes for yourself as you continue to grow. The management was very good for me locally, but this depends on which pharmacy you work at. The hardest part of the job I found is generating enough skilled staff to keep the pharmacy ahead. Ambition and motivation are definitely key factors you should think about before applying for this position."
good,this job does have some space for advancement and can help yu build your resume. I enjoyed the job and wish i could have kept the job. I recommend high school students to work here.
good,"Since this position was temporary, I could not comment on the full experience of working for the company directly.  I was treated with respect, and unfortunately had to leave when the job ended.  I enjoyed my time with them.  My ratings were simply based on observations and discussions with fellow employees."
good,"It was a great experience for me to work there. I enjoyed the fast paste environment. The job never became boring because there was always something to do! The managers were very nice most of the time and the pay was great. The hardest part of the job was maintaining being timely with finishing your assignment after you ran out of energy but other than that, the job was a overall blessing"
good,CVS Health is a great sustainable company to work for and as a Pharmacy Technician I have learned a lot about medicine and insurance companies in the 7 months I have been employed. I would like the company to treat their employees better as far as compensation and hourly pay. There is not much for the employees to look forward to or nothing rewarding enough for the amount of confidentiality we deal with on a daily basis. Overall I learned and acquired great experience throughout this job and built my resume.
good,"Be prepared for your day to go by fast. The work load was heavy, training was difficult because of the trainers. The culture can be up and down. They are moving the billing center to Arizona on May 31, 2017, must reapply for position if wanting to relocate."
good,love the staff..not keen on wage and lack of pay increase once became certified. also did not get compensated for becoming inventory specialist
good,"My schedule is from 5:30-2 pm everyday. I would come into work, log in and get ready to start taking calls from doctors office and assisting them with authorizations for insurance benefits on their patients medications. I learned a lot about medications and how they're used and what exactly they can be used for individually and combined. Its a great place to work and the possibilities of moving up in the company are easy too one you're a certified pharmacy technician. The job wasn't hard at all, just do your work and you can go home. All very simple."
good,This is a great job. You are constantly doing different things from filling prescriptions to waiting on customers.  You learn a lot as you work.  Can be fast paced.
good,"I had very good relationships with my coworkers at CVS/Caremark. It was some of the policies and procedures that were handed down by upper management that were not acceptable. You may get trained for every application and program that they use, yet be put on calls that only require the basic handling of the system. There were other things that I found to be ridiculous with the upper management, but all in all, it was a pretty good place to work. This would be a good intro job."
good,"The Pharmacy within a CVS store."
good,"I've learned good communication skills with both patients and other providers over the years. It can be very difficult working long hours without breaks and trying to meet the metrics which they've set for us, but it is rewarding being able to help patients directly with their medication need"
good,"•Abide to HIPPA practices in communication with patients "
good,I personally loved working for CVS.My reason for leaving was due to managent/pay complications.I was a pharmacy technician for a year and a half making front store wages due to managemnt never fixing my title in the computer.
good,"My opinion about this particular job was a good one.  It was challenging because I had to complete the hire process for new employees as well as teach them, train them and provide a test towards the end of class.  Dealing with this position, you tend to meet all kind of people who have some learning challenges and at times, class was longer bc some couldn't comprehend what was taught..  I had to prepare for class by printing books for every student and creating a folder for them which was tedious"
good,"CVS Health is a great company but the communication between management and employees are lacking. Not a lot of room for growth in the company and sometimes a negative atmosphere. An ""atta boy"" would be nice to hear every now and then"
good,"*A typical day at work consist of constant contact with customers - focus is on their need. "
good,"The co workers are wonderful, it was nice knowing what you have to do for the day when you come in, there was chances to learn different parts of the billing process"
good,"The most enjoyable moment of my past jobs ? I would say doing it because I love it and no just because of the money. I'm a people's person do I love meeting new people , if I can help everyone in the world in some kind of way I would."
good,"Completed training, then had interviews for promotions. Was placed in the store I went to as an alternate to get a bit more hands on experience. The manager that was promoted was offered another job at a corporate level. Was not given the opportunity to interview for the store once again, and had someone else brought in for the store."
good,They provided many opportunities to grow and being part of a company that was directly involved in the health of customers and patients was one of a kind.
good,"The workload is insane, there are lots of things required of you but if you have a great team you won't struggle too much. If you don't have a solid team to work with it will make working there very hard and unbearable."
good,"At CVS Health, you are expected to meet and exceed high targets with minimum staff who are often under-trained and underpaid. Employee turnover is typically high, especially in high-volume stores. Field management often makes promises to help support you with your day-to-day tasks, but they are so busy as well that help is often not provided. CVS is all about making targets and everything is measured. If you enjoy a fast pace and achieving goals, then you will do well here. If you prefer a slower environment and the ability to self-manage, then I would not recommend a job with CVS. There is opportunity for advancement, but it requires extra work on your own time. Expect to work longer than your scheduled shift - it is rare that you leave on time (at least if you care about the store, the customers, and the staff)."
good,"workers are overworked, and we work with old computers and printers that break down so often, very frustrating. the stores in new york are very busy so you are really working hard. if you are lucky , you will get to work with an amazing pharmacist"
good,"Stock shelves, help on the register, help customers its a very simple job and if your a supervisor you also help in the pharmacy which might be the hardest part of the job."
good,it was ok. knowing that i had different stores to go to not the same store.  every  store was different cause of the location knowing my type of poisons i couldn't do as so much.
good,"Dealing with customers all day with entering prescriptions, filling prescription vials, calling customers, and being cashier."
good,"It gets hectic, but the team supports you through the day. There's  lot of online training you have to do on site and at home."
good,Love the job and all my co- workers. Team flow is excellent. Only down fall is corporate and extremely low pay for how much work is put in.
good,Extreme high volume of work.  Rate of pay is inadequate for work performed.  Very fast paced and demanding where there is no time for breaks - at all!
good,"CVS Loss prevention is a joke. Typically 1 LP covers an entire city. I had 21 stores. Some stores are in a rough part of town. Depending on your boss, who I rarely seen, I made my own hours. In-store personnel are fun to be around."
good,This was an in between careers job.  It wasn't bad or wonderful.  I learned a few things working here.  There isn't anything good or bad that stand out.
good,"From the moment you walk in the door to the moment you leave you are full throttle... which may or may not be a problem for some. There's a severe need to be able to multitask and think on your feet. If you can't do that don't even bother because that inability will result in mounting stress... not on just yourself but your teammates as well."
good,It could be a great day or a very hard day. Busy during the day better to work at night phones never stop ringing and hard to get anything done.
good,"Everyday is a busy day at CVS. From the moment I open the store until I close, the work never stops. I take care of doctors' calls, follow up with insurance prior authorization, fill and dispense 500-600 scripts a day, advise patients on OTC medications..."
good,"challenging overall , must be a hard worker and able to multitask at many levels. Flexibility is a must with your hours and availability. Loved meeting people and having regular customers . The most enjoyable part is being close to your colleagues from spending so much time together."
good,"Since we were purchased by CVS in May of 2015, the atmosphere has drastically changed for the worst.  Everyone is in a constant state of fear that our jobs could be eliminated tomorrow.  Some of us have even been told that we know we will not have jobs after the beginning of 2016."
good,"Long hours, easy work, enjoyed it and paychecks looked nice,"
good,"N/A. Satisfying work experience. Amazing customers at the job place, but workers are not treated as well. Hardest part of our job is the time pressure that is put on the workers and Pharmacists. Co-workers are amazing, and all are hard workers, and have amazing work ethic."
good,"This retail pharmacy chain has pros and cons to it.  It is rewarding to see your regular patients and talk with them.  It is difficult with the type of scheduling and hours allowed for the certain stages of the pharmacy.  However, it is a learning experience from medication usages and needs to insurance information for deductibles, coverage, and prior auths.  The hours are not favorable due to the operating schedule of the chain, but everyone needs medications from the emergency rooms and urgent care centers."
good,I was hired to work part time to simply work the check out in the Pharmacy. They offered me a training and helped pay for me to get my license as a Pharmacy Technician.
good,"A typical day in the warehouse its pretty much just like any other warehouse.  Fast pace easy going a lot of machine moving around and trying to drive safe and efficient to get out product to the right trail so it can be loaded on the right truck.  So, it can be sent to the sent to the store and so that it will get there on time for the customers."
good,A typical day in the CVS Specialty Pharmacy in Monroeville was pretty decent. Normal call center routine. There is a lot of favoritism in the specific department that I worked in and there are few managers that actually took your requests to get a task done seriously. Another downfall is that it takes too long to get all the tools you need to be proficient. Rules and policies implemented that makes no sense which creates a lot of confusion which effects the customer. If this could be fixed this would be one of the best places to work.
good,CVS/Pharmacy is all about the customers. Making sure the customers are pleased with their service. Addressing each customer by their name. Taking the time to walk each customer over to the item they are looking for.
good,I enjoyed the structure of the job. I loved having a task and always keeping busy. The pharmacy is a place that I can learn as well as help. The pharmacist and coworkers all work hard as well as help and laugh with each other. The schedule changed alot and that was my only downfall. I love to know at least 24 hours before having to come in. I enjoyed the work because a pharmacist is what I want to be.
good,"a very stressful, but high paced entertaining job. a great place to work part-time but the pay is not high enough for the work required to be employed full time."
good,"Fill prescriptions, answer doctor calls, count medications, inventory, fill refills, answer phone calls, solve insurance issues, etc."
good,"A typical day begins with opening a total of thirteen systems used in a number of ways for enrollments ,pharmacy claims processing,order placement ,and order status inquiry. Using these systems requires organization and also the ability to create shortcuts to accomplish goals more efficiently i.e. ctrl F for quick searching information or key words.  After gaining access to the systems must maintain a calm collective attitude to assist with resolving customer issues as well as going the extra mile to make sure the members needs are met. CARE is the most important aspect of the job everthing revolves around the member experience and making sure all member maintain access to care i.e. reaching out to doctors for new prescriptions as well as documenting grievable issues in order to correct any and all short comings. The most rewarding part of the jqob is knowing that you are actually helping people who need it for example the elderly or disabled who dont fully understand how their coverage works.I enjoy helping people to the best of my abilities and would like to expand to different areas such as leadership and training."
good,"I started working at CVS as a shy-but-eager member of the team, I wanted to soak up as much knowledge as I possibly could since that first day there. I loved what I learned so much that it never felt like ""work"". I became the go-to guy for adjusting insurance claims and resolving customer disputes as well as preparing children's antibiotic mixtures.Typical days at CVS were pretty sporadic and a bit chaotic, between flu-shots, phone calls and immediate customers needs, actually filling prescriptions became a thing of the past. My supervisor was settling for only having 20% of the assigned work completed at the end of the day and I felt my own ambition starting to wane so I left which was the hardest decision I've ever made up to this point in my life because I had been with this company for nine years."
good,"A typical day at work is full of management conference calls, team calls and Web ex training on ever changing systems. Co workers are very knowledgeable and helpful when needed. The hardest part of the job is the lack of payer contracts and having to deny patient care do to authorizations not going through."
good,"A typical day at work would be filled with challenges. The last 3 years have been spent working with Rx America and CVS/Caremark IT teams transitioning all the network information from one platform to another. Working to make all desktops and laptops work in two different networks."
good,"Typing doctor prescription into the computer and assisting customers with insurance claims, approvals/denials. Filing prescriptions; counting. Calling doctors offices for insurance denial claims, getting approvals, and sending refill requests."
good,Great people to work with. Really developed a relationship with the staff. Was able to manage 60 pharmacists and 20 managers.
good,"A typical day at work would be fast-paced. I enjoyed working with my co-workers who would create a friendly enviroment and help customers feel welcomed and at ease while filling there prescriptions. My manager was very understanding when it came to scheduling, The hardest part of the job would of been just being understaffed at times, aside from that there was really nothing to complain about."
good,"The job is easy with quick advancement."
good,"Good company for stability and compensation."
good,"It was a very trying place to work. We were understaffed always. I loved my coworkers and we all worked well together. The management did the best they could with the hours they had to work with. the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the demand. They have still not replaced me making "
good,Need to be consistent in all departments with company policies no exceptions and no favoritism.
good,There was always claims that require research and resolution. Deadlines were a way of life. Sufficient staffing was a weekly roll of the dice. Not much down time. Lots of opportunities for teachable moments for myself and my staff.
good,This company is fine to work for. The only bad thing was the job advancement opportunities were not advertised for current employees to view.
good,A typical day at work consist of filling prescriptions. The job is stressful at times.
good,cvs was a great place to work for in 2005 when i first started it has become too coporate they really do not care about their employees and do not pay them enough either i often felt very overworked and that there was not enough help in the pharmacy to get everything done on a daily basis the only reason why i stayed so long is because they have very good benefits
good,"Co worker are great, and the training is good. it is Part time job that you can pick up hours if you want. If you want time off don't count on it."
good,"retail pharmacy, 24 hour location, busy times of the day 12p to 8pm,"
good,It was a great company to work for I loved the fact that at the end of the day I made the customer happy providing great customer service to our patients
good,A typical day at my job is busy. I enjoy my job and my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers and putting a smile on their face knowing that I caused it. I've learned to never stop doing my best and trying my hardest to succeed.
good,"Everything went great until new management came in, uncertain and unsettled."
good,It was an amazing opportunity it whas my first job ever. So it was an amazing opportunity to learn things i didnt and to meet interesting coworkers.
good,15 hour days take a toll on my body working as the only pharmacist with no lunch break is difficult. I enjoy working with my co-workers. I enjoy a lot of my customers and interacting with them.
good,"work days can be a challenge as a manager as you may not have many budgeted hours to have more than 1 cashier per shift"
good,Typical retail pharmacy.  I've learned to take it moment by moment...day by day
good,"Cashier, high school job, greeted customers and stocked shelves."
good,I have learned a lot from working at CVS about both myself and the way a cooperate business is run. The typical day at work in a CVS is generally the same. You perform the same tasks and deal with the same issues almost every day. My pharmacy is very small and i work with the same people every day. They only give enough hours to us so that there is only one technician so I have to do three times the amount of work that a typical CVS technician does. This is definitely the most difficult part of the job. My favorite part of my is dealing with patients. I like to make sure that everyone I deal with leaves feeling like I helped them as best as I could.
good,how to refill meds and put prescriptions in the computer and how to stock meds and do inventory
good,Did not have many hours available. Long commute. My manager was very flexible. I worked with a lot of elderly customers always enjoyed talking to them
good,Working at CVS allows me to help people get healthier by filling medications that they need to do that.  It is a wonderful feeling knowing that I contribute to other people living a healthy life.  I love when customers are happy when we can get their medications out to them promptly.  The hardest part of my day is coming across the not so friendly customers.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of  either being on an opening or closing shift. The shift would consist of two to four people during slow season or three to six for busy season. My job would consist of cashiering duties, if there were no other cashiers, and running the photo lab. In the lab I would make sure the machines were in working order and if not repair them. Another major job duty was customer service which required me to drop whatever i had at the moment if a customer needed assistance. I learned the basics of retail and customer service with an emphasis on the customer coming first. Management was overall good and co-workers worked best when given the right roles. The hardest part of the job came when I was the only cashier up front and had multiple customers asking for help in both the front end and in the photo lab. Such problems were mitigated by calling for assistance from coworkers when available. The most enjoyable part of the job was connecting with and getting to know coworkers and customers alike during my time at CVS."
good,"Great place to work at. its the hardest job to work at, with all the customers shopping there and buying things for there house hold."
good,I learned to work with a cash key and all different types of people
good,"The best aspect of the job is interacting with customers, if your a people friendly person. One who works for the company long enough will gain the knowledge of working with a multitude of systems used to make the business efficient."
good,"A typical work day there would be coming into the store for the mid-day rush of customers. All in a rush, so their attitudes weren't the best when trying to give them great service. The comments to be heard from the customers were amazing and a shock especially to see it coming from the older people in line. Of course while cleaning the store there are times when you will find that items are missing. People have stolen things such as wine, beauty products, condoms, even pregnancy tests. This is a daily occurrence, yet nothing can be done about it cause around the afternoon time there aren't many people working to cover the whole floor. At most we have 2 cashiers, the photo technician, a manager and a person doing stock. That store is pretty big, and that's not enough personnel to catch thievery."
good,"Of course the job experience greatly varies depending on your store's location and productivity of its employees, however, I have found that sometimes the management lacks compassion for its employees. That aside, I have learned a great deal about customer satisfaction as well as different varieties of medications. Generally, my coworkers try to get the job done and to provide good service but occasionally I feel that they care more about getting to the end of their shift rather than doing something the correct way. The most difficult part of the job is enduring the amount of stress you will no doubt encounter due to the nature of the job (created by the customers and the job itself). I do really enjoy helping other people and seeing a happy, satisfied customer really makes the job worth it all."
good,"CVS is a fun place to work, but they throw a lot of duties on you at once, you start to become overwhelmed. The hardest part was dealing with my co-workers."
good,"Big company retail pharmacy, management keeps putting out new programs and adding to workload with out adding to staffing."
good,"Being a CVS Pharmacy Service Associate, I was able to work closely with the public with their issues regarding their dealings with the store pharmacy. This grew my problem solving skills with the public and enabled me to grow in the area of working with people despite differences and unhappy customers."
good,"Low pay but fun, friendly staff. Good breaks and fun to shop in store."
good,"I love working for CVS Pharmacy because each day when I go home, I know that I've helped someone."
good,"Most days were the same generally as far as the job went, although the names and faces changed. Enhanced customer service skills and understanding of different people,"
good,Mostly handling medicine and assisting pharmacist with tasks
good,Horrible pay and difficult hours. Customers always yelling at you and your always on your feet for hours with only one half hour break.
good,The corporation does not seem to value their employees as much as they should. Everything is about numbers and their competitors i guess. The raises were only 2% every year. All in all. for the work we were doing.. not enough money being paid to employees in the pharmacy
good,"Very happy place with many opportunities. The more you give ,the more you receive. What I learned was to be very patient. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers."
good,"Working at CVS has been over all a good experience, but management is questionable. I had the flu for two days that I was scheduled to work and the store manager threatened my job, along with many other things. The other managers are very sweet and great to work with for night shifts, though and the job has been a great over all experience."
good,"I can not speak for the entire company, but the pharmacy department is a difficult work environment, with unrealistic goals.  Quantity of work, I feel, was more important than employees."
good,"Excellent customer service"
good,"CVS is a good company but still gearing towards becoming a better company. It appears the company has a lot of debt due to its recent acquisitions - AETNA etc. As a result, there is a lot of cut-back in staffing in most pharmacies. The customers are being well taken care of. However, most pharmacy staff members feel over-worked during their shifts. It is the joy and smiles on the faces of my patients that keep me going daily. I am sure the future things will get better."
good,"I’ve been with the company for 3 years, the company itself is a wonderful place to work but the management only cares about themselves and not the career path and advancement of the employees."
good,"Each store with its management and staff is a different environment from another, and the tone of the workplace depends most heavily on how teams collaborate. Not a difficult job on the surface, but definitely requires problem solving skills and attention to detail in order to excel and provide excellent experiences. Hardest days are always fast-paced and stressful, especially in flu season, but you can definitely find enjoyment in it if you work well with your team. Every store's staff is like a second family once you've known them for a little while, and they will be on your side through thick and thin as long as you do your part to contribute to the team's success."
good,CVS is a good place to work and has some great people. Sometimes the work is stressful and fast paced. Some of the management leaves a lot of room for improvement.
good,"Intense13 hr work day work shift. Enjoy helping my customers. Have worked in 35 plus stores. I have worked as a Pharmacist in charge , then overnight shift, a floating Pharmacist and a staff Pharmacist. I have owned my own Pharmacy's."
good,"If it were not for a loophole in the way that FMLA works, I would likely still be employed at Omnicare... but because I was about 30 hours short of coverage, I was terminated automatically during leave I had to take, while caring for my mother who had Cancer.  She died 3 weeks after taking my leave, I did not even know I was terminated until the day after she passed away.  "
good,20% discount off of all non-sale items and 30% off store brand non-sale items. Good benefits and flexibility of schedule. Raises are once per year and usually not that much. Starting pay is minimum wage and all employees start off as part-time.
good,Working at CVS with such a required responsibility and a fast paced environment was a really good working experience to benefit me I the future. the environment was mostly good considering all the employees were great at keeping a dteady flow
good,"I was very comfortable where in my position for over 5 years, however all of a sudden corporate decided pharmacists didn't need help and cut practically all of our hours. When we as technicians asked what we were supposed to to about our benefits, they answered ""you lose them"", and of course she didn't care because her benefits weren't getting taken away. I love my direct managers and pharmacy team, but the company needs to understand that with out us ""workers"" the company is going to crash and burn."
good,It’s an experience working at CVS. I’ve enhoted getting to know the customers and my coworkers. I’ve learned a lot in the 4 years I’ve worked at the company.  If you never worked retail before CVS would be an excellent opportunity for you to learn and progress from.
good,"I learned about Medication and how to process it, and how to type in scripts doctors send to the pharmacy. They were flexible with your schedule and days you request off."
good,"Filling 200-300 prescriptions per day, managing another pharmacist , technicians and interns. Counseling patients on their medications and good health practices. Solving insurance claims, processing medication orders and ordering medications and supplies. scheduling staff. Everything mentioned under Walmart except vaccinations and health clinics which are new to pharmacy practice"
good,Typical day at work is very high paced. Receive calls on right after the other. I learned a lot about the medicines patients need and how to provided the service for patients to receive their medications promptly. Management is very understanding to personal needs. There is not hard part of my job. Most enjoyable part of my job is making the patients happy and getting their medication to them  in a timely manner.
good,"Pay is ok if you have a good store manager. I had a good manager, but I didn't like the way the stores are run now. Big corporations in general only care about their bottom line. CVS really only cares about the pharmacy and don't have enough people scheduled to help customers. The registers also are to much about collecting customer information which makes the lines move slow."
good,Loved working for CVS pharmacy as a pharmacy technician they help me advance my career in the pharmacy they helped me understand why we did certain things and how we did them they help me completely understand my role in the medical field and pharmacy worlds
good,A good enough environment. Good pay for what the job entails but corporate and a lot of what they expect of you can be difficult to work with. You must essentially follow scripts to try and get good surveys with all high marks or you could lose your job.
good,"Although, I did not enjoy working for the company, it could be a good fit for others. I personally did not enjoy the hours, at the time I worked there we did not have other employees who liked working so the environment was not what it should be. If you are in school for something in the medical field though, this is a good step in the right direction and could help you learn about health/wellness."
good,"Great benefits, great company to work for, plenty of work available. Enough staff available to help with technical staff, work is not too strenuous, and overall enjoyed the time I worked at CVS"
good,"A day as a CVS Retail Pharmacist is all about the metrics.  We are ranked on how quickly we input prescriptions, how quickly they are filled and verified, how quickly we retrieve voice mail, and customer service surveys."
good,"It's a retail job, it has its perks and downfalls. Everyone I work with is great, but at a cooperate level, I don't really like where the company is going."
good,I worked with CVS for over 5 years. CVS was my first Pharmacy Tech job. The work environment is always busy and always short handed. There were times we did not take a lunch break at all. The pay was not good and it was always stressful.
good,Okay company to work for but they expect way to much of just one person. They keep cutting hours but expect you to do all the thing that you did before with all your help.
good,Health benefits are excellent. Many activities for employee involvement. Hard work fast paced environment and tough work-life balance. Long hours during seasonal pushes in a retail setting (stores must get deliveries). Expectations on leadership extremely high and must be prepared to balance daily requirements with operations long term DC metrics from a corporate level.
good,"You stock shelves, vacuum the front of the store and face the shelves. Management is very amazing there. I learned how to organize and stock Hallmark cards."
good,"The amount of work they expect you to do is nearly impossible.  I had wonderful co-workers and management, but corporate was horrible.  They are only concerned with the volume of prescriptions, not quality.  It's a recipe for a major mistake to be made by the pharmacist."
good,"Typical corporate America.  Company doesn't care about its employees, they are only concerned about saving dollars.  I relocated here on a contract to hire.  In the middle of the contract a senior director decided to move in another direction and hence cut my position."
good,"its a cool place to work at times, depending on the department youre in i guess, but it also a revolving door, someone is always leaving, dont know if thats due to pay, management, hours, or just enviroment period. but if youre coming to  clock in, work and go home, maybe its the place for you."
good,"I worked for CVS Pharmacy for 2 years in both the front store and as a Pharmacy Technician. The training for both positions is fluent and easy to understand and the trainers do a satisfactory job on preparing employees. The managers, for the most part, are very helpful towards employees and understanding towards balancing work and life. You will receive a 20 percent discount on items in the store and 30 percent on CVS branded items. You also have a preferred stock option available and a 401k option. As far as compensation goes, in my opinion, the pharmacy technicians are not fairly paid for the amount of work that is expected of you as well as the fast paced high demand environment of filling prescriptions and dealing with insurance companies. If you don't want a job where customers have the potential to get very nasty, this job is NOT for you. There is no Dental Plan or Health Insurance option available as well. It can be a great place to work if you're looking for flexible hours or looking to make some extra cash, but the job can be overwhelming and stressful on occasion."
good,It has good benefits but many times you have to work with little staff and the customer services is very difficult to maintain 100 % since patients are too annoyed by the waiting time
good,Management is very not very trusting of it's employees they record everything right down to the amount of time you don't move the mouse. The people there are generally nice though.
good,This was a very busy job but I honestly enjoyed how fast paced it was. The days seemed to go by so fast! There was never any downtime and a lot of times you barely had a chance to breathe. The customers would become irate but that just seemed to make me push harder. I really loved this job!
good,"Some locations (like my own) are laid back. Most days we only took in $2500. Other days, i would end up working at a busier location where they make twice that much in a day. Job security isnt a question. They have people coming and going all the time. (Probably because the populous is filled with work-ethic lacking kids)"
good,"CVS was a great place to work overall.  Management sometimes were clueless on projects time intervals.  Worked at the corp. offices in smithfield, RI.   People i work with were wonderful...  Would work there again for a better manager."
good,This work environment is a great place to get good experience with the pharmacology aspect of healthcare. It teaches you a lot about the different kinds of medications and their classifications.
good,I have had problems with this company. I wanted to return and had an interview at one of their stores. I was told i had a job but then told there were problems getting me into their computer system. I kept in constant contact for two weeks. All of a sudden i was told that my store manager was no longer there and that the new manager had no idea who i was or what was going on and too bad.
good,"typical day was arriving on job receiving orders and continuing with days assignmets,after finishing helping someone complete their work load if they have fallen behind to get the work order completed for that particular day/shift."
good,"A company whose main goal is to make money while simultaneously caring for their constituents. "
good,"At CVS everyday is a busy and challenging day that I look forward to. Whether resolving insurance incidents or ordering specialty medication for patients, each day presents with a new challenge that I keeps me learning and growing as a pharmacist"
good,Caremark Pharmacy was excellent company.  The company offers good benefits and give you the opportunity to work with great people. A typical day at work is a lot hard work.
good,It was a great place to work up until another company took over then things started to change and mostly not for the better. The new manager of the department does not have the experience needed to lead a team and therefore a lot of people are not happy and we have lost a lot of people in the last few months make our job more difficult due to the fact that there is more work for the new facilities just acquired and not enough people to do the work.
good,I found CVS to be a fast paced work environment and at times stressful depending on the day and shift. I was able to learn skills which I will use in the future.
good,"Working here can be fun but stressful at times. Just keep in mind you are helping people get better. You will wear many hats while being here, tech,drive thru, cashier. You'll do fine if you can keep calm."
good,Great place at first but people where hired with past relationships with managment and that led to a downward spiral of work place environment and favoritism.
good,"Good company to work for out of school when money is key.  I do not think I would do this forever because of the stress, however.  Too much is expected with no enough help most of the time."
good,"Cvs is an extremely tough company to work for.."
good,"It was a good place to work, but they relocated to Arizona."
good,I really enjoy working at my current location. The Pharmacy Manager and partner pharmacist are both awesome. I enjoy working the the current technicians that are staffed and enjoy working with the customers.
good,"All thought I loved what I do at CVS, there are a few things i would change. My hours are never a set schedule, i may go in at 9 in the morning but if i was scheduled to get off at 6, i may not leave till 7 or 7:30.  Even though your job is important, so is the employees personal life. Some people have a family and children they have to take care of including me, a set schedule would be more sufficient. This is the main reason i no longer want to continue a career in CVS.   CVS has taught me many things, from all the different medicine in the healthcare community to each of there treatments, and which diagnosis they specifically treat. I know various health conditions, and most of there maintainable cures with medicines. Im a very social person, i loved the fact that i got to meet and talk with all my patients on a day to day basis. Being a pharmacy technician was more than just counting out a number of pills per script. It was about helping others help themselves."
good,a good place to work but very they provide pto vacation time up front no questions ask. a typical day just taking calls all day for specialty medication
good,The pharmacist in Nashua was rude to the customers and employees.  He would announce when he wanted to fire someone and would do it I that day.  The pharmacy also made me feel like we were back in high school.
good,"I strive everyday to do my best. I always was rewarded in every way. However, I was not going anywhere. My job title was at a stand still. They kept promising me more but never followed thru. They told me management was requiring more time in my position. Then I went to work for family. It was closer to home."
good,"Coram is a great place to work if you don't get involved in friendship with the general manager.  She is the gossip of the company.  Doing my job and compounding is amazing.  The coworkers were great.  "
good,"CVS expects too much for little hours provided for Technicians. Micro managed to the max, making it more stressful to push for numbers than real patient cared service."
good,This company gives you a chance for advancement that I have been able to rep the benefits of. I have worked with this company for 3 years and have gone from being a part time cashier to a full time cashier to a full time Pharmacy Technician with benefits. It is a  good place to work but it is very busy.
good,"Temporary employees are not given much of a chance. If it's layoff time, temps go first no matter how good their work ethic."
good,Working on production & also having 100% accuracy. Management is very caring and always try to find to make work better for us.
good,Stressful work area co-worker are nice benefits are good needs some change it seems as is more of quantity instead of quality when it comes to the working with this company employees are promised one position of work and end up
good,It is your typical mail order pharmacy with higher expectations that reality. The department I worked in closed and was moved to another state.
good,The thing that sucked about cvs is the pay. I was a supervisor and only made 70 cents more than minimum wage. The work was not easy compared to the pay.
good,"I ""joined"" CVS Health in December through an acquisition, and so far it has been going well. However, there isn't good communication and many projects or processes are communicated with very little time to do them in. Very frustrating."
good,It can be a great place to work at but the big wigs want everyone to work at a very cheap price. I would have loved to stay if they would have worked with my needs & I.
good,CVS is a good place to work and because it has so many locations you have the ability to find a job easily if you decide to move.
good,"A typical day at work would be a busy learning environment. I learned that health and medication is something people need daily. New medication is made daily. The manager of the store was kind and respectful. The manager for the pharmacy was okay. The people I worked with was okay to a certain extent. Every workplace there is always a disrespectful individual and somebody who want to be in control. The hardest part of the job was not being able to get trained liked I would like. Also, not being able to give the customers the help they need. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers. The customers were kind and respectful. There were customers who got upset when they could not have their way but sooner or later apologized."
good,"i enjoy what i do so everything is cool about it. the management is great and so are my coworkers. although it gets VERY busy, it makes the day go by quick!"
good,It is a good company overall to work with. a typical day can be tiring depends on what day it is. The customers are good and friendly and the coworkers are also very cooperative and friendly.
good,"the coworkers are really nice and the environment is very nice the hardest part of the job is getting use to the hours and the over time when the holidays come around but thats easy to get use too. a typical day at work includes you staying at one station for the whole shift which is very annoying and irritating. some of the management is very nice and know what they're doing and on the other hand, some of them dont know what they're doing. the most enjoyable part of the job was the dinners they would give you on holidays and the parties they did for appreciation."
good,"We got paid plenty and I helped many, many people with their medications. My co workers were very nice and my pharmacist partner was stealing narcotics and I had to get out of there so it wouldn't look like I did it.The district manager, was not always fair to me."
good,"Busy environment and expectations are high. Work-life balance and job stress depends on the store that you work at. Overall, the job as a pharmacist, pharmacist intern, or pharmacy technician can be difficult at times. However, CVS is a great company to work for when it comes to job security, compensation, and personal growth"
good,Very Very busy  24 hour store. It could have been managed better however I was not the manager. Hardest part of the job was having to constantly turn away suspicious prescriptions. What I learned from CVS is that I after leaving the company due to family issues I can really help the company if I were  a manager. The company has a lot of potential.
good,Fun work place with supportive managment .I started as customer service and then CVS trained me for pharmacy tech .A very busy store but i loved working over there
good,"Its always very busy at work everyday.  I learned that making numbers of goals and less errors are very important to the company. Having less number on goals and errors means no bonus and raise at all. They are very strict on the policy.  The managements needs to focus more on employees situations, time managements, and fairness.  Most employees are nice and hard working. Its just there are a lot of turn overs, not sure how long employee, pharmacist, supervisor, and even manager will last.  The hardest part of the job is the goal number that employee needs reach on daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job is the break time."
good,"I love working with most of my co-workers. The main PIC probably shouldn't be a PIC but that's none of my business. My store's management is good but it's like pulling teeth for a raise. Seriously, they're really cheap. So unless you like arguing about your pay everyday until they eventually crack and pay you more than I'd suggest you go somewhere else."
good,"I enjoyed meeting new people everyday (shoppers). They were all so friendly. I loved being able to practice my outstanding customer service skills regularly. The workplace had a nice calm vibe to it. There were always tasks to be completed, so I stayed busy at all times. I enjoyed ringing up customers at the register and telling them about all of the great promotions at the time. This was the easiest part of the job, as I get along with people. The most challenging part was when we would have a high volume moment and there wasn't any help. Customers would get impatient.Overall, this is a pretty good company to work for."
good,"As far as jobs go, CVS Health Speciality Pharmacy is an outstanding place to work. The overall atmosphere is laid back and enjoyable."
good,a day would start by answering the phone talking to pts and dr and getting scripts ready to be picked up. The most enjoable part of the job is learning new things and knowing that I am helping people
good,The hardest part of this job was not having time not even to go to the bathroom. Was very stressful because it was a calling center so it was more like working for a factory.
good,"I worked at a 24 hour CVS with Minute Clinic inside. There would be hundreds of new scripts coming in everyday and hundreds of phone calls and customers. A typical day would be working at production and sorting the medicine, working at drop off and handling and putting prescriptions into the computer and finally working at the register. Very fast paced, no time for breaks, The co-workers and the pharmacist were awesome. They made the job more enjoyable."
good,Very unorganized and not a stable job. Hired as full time and sometimes only recieved part time hours. Learned a lot about healthcare and prescription drug coverage. Overall a great learning experience.
good,"Every person who works at Retail Pharmacy, can agree with me... it is very hard sometimes.  But when you love what you do, there is always something positive at the end of the day."
good,"I love my job.  However there is very little opportunity for advancement from the position that I hold.  My knowledge of a fast paced work environment has been greatly enhanced.  Working with co-workers has been a very positive experience.  I feel that I have made many life time friendships with CVS.  "
good,"Daily work day consists of typing prescriptions into patient profile"
good,basically everyone was super nice that I worked within the short time that I worked for them.. but my schedule would change alot.. my manager would tell me that I would get 30 hours one week then look at it and only have like 14 hours on the schedule! so gave me no choice but to resign due to the fact he wasnt giving me anymore hours then what I have requested when I first got hired.
good,"My typical day at work consists of dealing with customers face to face as well as on the telephone. Data entry for inputting customer information into pharmacy computer system. Counting and dispensing medication to customers. Handling doctors calls and refill request. Filing and faxing information. Management were ok. The hardest part of my job was the slow periods where there was less customer interaction because the building was so quiet time seemed to drag. The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with irate customers, They would come in totally upset over something simple and I would love fixing the problem so that I could see them leave happy and satisfied."
good,"I love to work in the pharmacy and I love what I do, however I am looking for a higher paying job."
good,I enjoyed working for this company.  I worked for them for 16 years and would have been there now if my husband had not died.
good,frequently cut hours so you never know how many hours you are going to get. Inconsistent scheduling  but I love the people who work at CVS
good,"If You did not make rate you were ""let go"".  Worked in the Warehouse or dc as they called them. Worked Monday to Friday first shift of over a year only working 3 Saturday in that time. Over all the job good and easy to do for the most part. Management was friendly but was not always truthful about the hours you need to work. They have minatory over time you go home when the job is done which could be over 12 hours any give day. They also had time some  slow time were you work less in 8 hours in a day"
good,The hardest part of this job is getting to know your insurances and becoming familiar with all the medications used in the medical field.
good,"Going to work is like going to my second family, I love the people that I work with"
good,"A typical day at work starts at high strung from the moment I walk in and most times until the I leave. I work at one of the busiest locations in my city. We are 24 hours, 365 days a year. This job definitely strengthens my ability of being able to work quickly and accurately while under pressure. I work with a variety of people from various background which is interesting but sometimes can also be a challenge. The hardest part of the job would be the high demand of customers we serve on a daily basis. I work in the health field so you have to be very accurate with every step you take because a persons life depends on it, but you also have to be very fast and be really great at multi-tasking. Although the job can be very stressful it has a very rewarding feeling at the end of the day. It's a great feeling when you see a mom walk out the store with medicine for her sick child or an old person telling you that they enjoy coming to your pharmacy and won't go anywhere else."
good,"It was a good place to work and a good experience to have, but very little room for advancement and you are not rewarded based on skill level."
good,"working at CVS was fun and, well experienced because i join the work ability corp to learn and develop the skill and confidence i would need for applying at other jobs."
good,"a typical day work at coram is normal and enjoyable"
good,a typical day at work is load 48 inch trucks I perform the daily function of shipping and/or packing of prescription orders in accordance with standard operating procedures.
good,I found the job frustrating in that a lot of times I was not able to assist the customer because of restrictions based on the prescription coverage provided by their client along with the new Government regulations involved with medicare d I simply found a heck of a lot of red tape involved.
good,"A typical day at work consists of filling 700-900 prescriptions.  I am fluent in all aspects of the process.  My schedule varies as I work in a 24 hour retail pharmacy that is open full service on holidays as well.  I manage a range from 13-18 technicians.  I am in charge of scheduling, training, customer service, third party resolution, coaching and counseling, interviewing applicants, assisting the pharmacists, and inventory.  I have a great and open relationship with my co-workers.  I never ask them to do anything I wouldn't do for I lead by example. The hardest part of my job is not having enough time to train as I would like.  I would like to be able to provide more in depth training but budget cuts make that difficult.  I love every part of my job from the cranky customer to the pleasant ones as well.  I am used to working 50-60 hours weekly so hard work doesn't scare me.  "
good,fun to work at. busy and stressful but it went by fast staff are awesome to work with 
good,I am a pharmacy technician at CVS. CVS is a great company to learn about the field they offer great training an benefit for employee. however they usually do not hire full-time employee. You have to wait and wait for years before become a full-time or you may get lucky if there is an full time opening. the hardest part of the job i would say customers are demanding and they sometime come at once and start yelling you need to know how to deal with stress. The thing to enjoy at CVS is definitely the training they show you everything about the job. even if the pay is far from what you expecting when you start .
good,"I loved my job at cvs! i couldn't have asked for a better job! the job itself was really laid back, and easy. You connected and became fond of the regular customers! the only downside is the pay/hours. its a nice job for a high school student though!"
good,"i Had to clean the parking lot everyday.. I Had fun doing the work, i also met alot of people while working at CVS.."
good,Always something to do and enjoyed helping others at this job. Management at times seem to care less about employees.
good,"Working very understaffed ,Ringing register, photo lab and ,supervisor. Customer service facing store stocking shelves."
good,"If you like dealing with a diverse range of customers, and have strong customer service skills, working at CVS is great opportunity to showcase these skills. You must have a friendly upbeat attitude, and patience is a MUST. Things don't always go as you would like, and you may end up serving a difficult customer, but you must always remain amicable. Duties include typing prescriptions, insurance adjudication, answering phones, working drive thru, cashier duties, filling prescriptions, and maintaining the pharmacy. I work in a high volume store, so it is very important to have staff that work well together under pressure. Must be a team player! It gets stressful, but it can be very rewarding so long as the customer comes first and you think of it as satisfying their needs and making them happy."
good,They are very structured and have down to earth rules and regulations. The benefits are the best i have seen and they give you plenty of help.
good,"You are filling prescriptions, but most of the job is customer service. Depending on your area, the customers can be very demanding and rude. You need thick skin to work in the pharmacy. I have no problem with my coworkers, and the workplace is an accepting environment."
good,"It’s a great way to start out and help you learn the basics for pharmacy. I wish the pay was better, but overall it’s a great job to get a feel for pharmacy and get your license. Team is very supportive and everyone works together hours a flexible if you wish to grow in the company there is plenty of opportunity out there."
good,Very demanding job with unrealistic expectations at times especially dependent on overseeing management at the current time. Often times not enough help to complete job requirements accurately.
good,"Overall the employees are very nice and great to work with. Same can be said for the customers, not all of them though. The job requires patience and thick skin. I have learned how to coach and motivate my co-workers as well as deal with conflicts that pop up with customers. Retail is not easy at all, customer service is far from a nice job, but there are some small benefits. Increased pay for working on holidays for example."
good,"The job and employees are wonderful.  The benefits are way too expensive, large premiums, copays and deductibles.  They do not pay holidays off either, with low PTO and only 30 hours of work per week.  Pay is decent however you are a one man show."
good,"Very very fast paced, could cause a lot of stress but makes the day go by faster, coworkers were awesome we always found away to come togehter and get it done"
good,At the beginning they are amazing to work for. If you need restrictions they try to help but be careful. It can be stressful and sometimes you can get burned out.
good,"It was fun working at CVS, I learned a lot from CVS, such as cash handling and customer service, organizing and more. The management was ok. I loved my manager. They respect customers. The hardest part of the job was when it was quiet and when we did not have customers, and the enjoyable part was when the store was busy and crowded by people."
good,It was a fun and friendly enviornment. The workers sometimes would come together during the holidays and have different competitions for prizes. Sometimes the building was too big and there were different people that I have never met.
good,CVS is a great place to work if you are looking for a challenge. It really challenges you to get faster in your job performance and allows you to become more knowledgeable at what you do. Full time employees get great benefits. They provide affordable Healthcare insurance. A con of working there though is the fact that they have short lunches but employees work long tedious hours.
good,"Decent starter job for those coming out of pharmacy school. Always room for advancement. Nothing against the company, just not an environment I wanted to continue working in."
good,Very challenging and technical role that requires to anticipate and be prepared for a wide variety of questions/situations. Tons of exposure to SVP+ and how they think.
good,time flies when working in the pharmacy and caring for patients. cvs pharmacy is an excellent work environment to have a job in especially the pharmacy because it is beneficial to medical students like me to learn about the various drugs and new knowledge of things
good,would come in for overnight shift an have to unload the truck of merchandise.then would have to sort the items out according to the respective isle in the store.then place items on the shelves in time for the next day.
good,Complete store operational requirements by scheduling and assigning different tasks to subordinates.  Uphold staff by training and orienting employees.
good,The manager is awesome and very understanding.  The work is extremely fast paced.  Employees good to work with.  Corporate keeps cutting hours which makes it very difficult to have enough work to pay bills.
good,its hard work managerment is bad they don't listen to the employees 
good,This was positively the best environment I have ever worked . 
good,"It was an okay place to work, worked will with family and work life balance.  It is a heavy work load and you are doing more than just your job at times"
good,Hardest part of the job is not having enough employees working at the same time to get through the day. During the week things can get busy and customers get disappointed about having to wait to get their prescriptions.
good,This was a good place to work and gave many options for moving forward. Somewhat stressful being a call center. Incentives given monthly and always provided team work encouragement.
good,There is no work/life balance from September through January each year with expectations of working 50+hours each week. Wonderful co-workers! Find it difficult to move to another department.
good,"Competitive company. All the day there is new challenge for me. Excellent co-worker, I love working with them. Good management. More professional staff."
good,CVS was an ok place to work. Some of the managers were good managers and some weren't. Some presented an attitude towards others. The pay was not so great. For a first job it would be an ok place to work.
good,"Becoming close with the patients was the pros, and have a coworker great friends. Finding solution to problems and helping the patients was the highlight of the job."
good,"A typical day working for CVS Health Specialty Pharmacy usually results in learning something new every day about a different drug or patient you come across.  I've learned to become patient, more open, and also giving others the floor the speak as well.  It was a okay work environment but, when it came to management it was very difficult to get assistance or understanding on a daily basis.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the employees you're surrounded by and the loving energy you feel from people you can call friend."
good,"help guests with prescriptions they drop off, process the prescription then fill them have pharmacist verify them and ring the guest up. Call insurances if a problem, notify guest if the medication they need is out of stock. call doctors for refills on medications."
good,Typical day at work is busy and hectic because there is not too much help from pharmacy techs. Management required a lot of extra paperwork for pharmacist.
good,"The pay was good, the people with whom you work with are also good and the clientele was very friendly. My unfortunate time here involved having opposite weekends with my wife's available weekends, being promised, and then denied the switch after 6 months."
good,"CVS is a place to learn, and that is something that I have appreciated.  The ability to learn and grow have been a great part of my work life.   There is a healthy balance between work life and home, and that is one of the best things about this company."
good,Dealt with alot of people ordering prescriptions not always happy with their benefits . Most were nice. Coworkers were young inexperienced that was probably the hardest thing about the job. They also had shift bids I personally didnt like that
good,Pretty good job if you're starting out. Boring 90 percent of the time. The weekends are slow and easy just tedious. Management is cool. co-workers are cool.
good,"Really enjoyed the day to day work and the customers were usually friendly. I loved my co-workers and managers, they definitely made it feel like working with family."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is I'm in my own space my managers are really nice they aren't very understanding of family an emergency. You are dealing with older people so some of their stories so really sad. And you also have to be ready to deal with some unhappy people as well.
good,"a typical day was answering multi line phone system answering patients question about medications. Filling medications entering prescriptions for patients running insurance . doing inventory, ordering medications. Counting and filling medications. waiting on customers at counter and drive thru"
good,"Just like any company, it has it's ups and downs. My leadership does not understand what a training organization is and runs it like an IT organization."
good,"Very good job if fast paced retail is your thing. If it isn't then maybe institutional is more suited for you."
good,"it was a great place to work at, co-workers, managers. they would always acknowledge all the work and effort we would do."
good,Good pay and benefits.  No life or death situations.  Biggest issue is the isolation.  In a small room for the entire shift. No coworkers.   During Flu season you are seated 3 feet from an active (coughing) flu patient during entire visit.
good,answering in bound and out bound call   great place to grow   401k   free parking  rasies every 6 month   paid sick days   paid training
good,"This was a great job that offered a ton of over time and a chance to make a great income."
good,"Running the cash register and keeping area neat and organized. I learned how to pay attention to the needs of the store. The management was very well. My co-workers were very helping and friendly. The hardest part of the job was not knowing how to do something, that i eventually perfected in. I mostly enjoyed providing customer service and fulfilling my duties for the store."
good,it is a fast paced environment with little help. Good benefits and salary however severely understaffed and no breaks.
good,"it is NOT for everyone. "
good,I enjoyed going to work at the early morning hours I felt at my best at the hours that I worked 6.00 am to 2.30 pm.  I learned a wealth of knowledge and enjoyed learning. I felt the management was fair with their staff.  My co-workers worked well together.  The hardest part of the job was working with hot issues with member claims in the issues boxes. The most enjoyable part of the job was competing all my issues on a timely manner.
good,"stress-less place to work, provide skill needed to get the job done, wonderful co-worker. the schedule is flexible. the management is at the top and provide needed information to  the emplyees"
good,"CVS was a nice job to just manage my bills. It was not a job nor place I could get excited about, they cut y hours just after offering me an assistant manager position. I was very dissatisfied with this work place."
good,"A typical work day consisted of someone almost always calling off on a busy day or just being scheduled short handed. "
good,"CVS is a growing corporation and I enjoy working there. I am surrounded by great coworkers and have flexible hours, due to the fact that I am in school."
good,I did learn a lot in that job and I hate to see it go but I have to move on.
good,"No Day is typical.  To expect the expected is the norm.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with the ""red-tape"" in order to get patients' their medication.  The most enjoyable aspect of my job is having positive outcomes for our patients during their most vulnerable time."
good,"Type prescriptions, fill prescriptions, count pills, dosage measurements, answer calls from patients doctors, nurses, healthcare providers, and etc. Great Teamwork!"
good,"I now know to run a retail store."
good,Good learning experience and a transitional position for the future.  A lot of people go to the pharmacy!
good,it was fun till i got promoted and got no help from my dist. so when i i asked for help i got turned down
good,I really have no complaints with my work experience at Cvs pharmacy. You clock in and if you are a supervisor you find the supervisor your relieving and find out what else needs to be done. If your a cashier you clock in a start tending to the register and or receive a list of task 
good,"CVScaremark is a great place to work the people are great, management is always helpful and the hardest part of the job is not being able to work longer hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we have group lunches and meetings, i learned a lot about different types of medications, insurances plans, and also different ways to explain members medical plans. "
good,"Tyrpically my day would start off by looking at what needed to be accomplished and doing it.  My manager and i would go threw a game plan of what needed to be done for that day.  I would work many different shift 1st, 2nd, and 3rd."
good,"Daily customer interaction, with opportunity to learn and develop new skills and develop working knowledge."
good,i take care of costumer make sure they get a good service at cvs. i learn that costumers come first and that they are very important to us. working with people is very good and important because it give you that responsibility of you taking care of what you need to do...i take care a lot of things at my job they say im a very hard worker...the higher part of the job is trying to make costumer come back to cvs. the most enjoyable part of the job is taking care of costumer because i like working with costumer i like been around people meeting new people and i like that.
good,I think CVS is a great company to work for. I had a great time converting the Sav-on stores to CVS and their system is fool proof. Pay is great and its outpatient so you have to get used to dealing with insurance and upset customers
good,Fill prescription
good,CVS is an enjoyable retail job. It has a very relaxed atmosphere.
good,When i started working for CVS it was OK and fun for the most part. It just gets boring standing for 8 hours at a time. i learned a lot from the job ad have me a lot of skills because i learned how to stock thing out and also be able to work with the money and the merchandise nut its a lot of work and your back will definitely hurt the first couple of days.
good,"They hired me for Full Time Position and I have never got more than 30 hours... this is NO FAIR AT ALL. They just don’t care what happen to your life, they just mess up your schedule and everything has to be ok..."
good,"They hire all part-time workers so that they do not have to pay benefits. This is a great job for college students, people looking for part-time work, but this is not a job to work and make a living. They are all about the money. They do not care about employee's safety at all period. Benefits are basically non-existent. I had a great manager that I worked under. I truly have nothing but Love and Respect for him!"
good,"I worked at CVS for the majority of my college career, and I have to say that I enjoyed it. Sometimes the tasks did became repetitive, but for the pay and hours they offer, I would not have wanted to work anywhere else while going to school."
good,It really is a great place to work....especially if you are a high school student or college student....the only problem is the hours that are distributed.
good,"Retail services are difficult, there's just no sugar coating that. It is extremely difficult handling angry customers day in and day out. Working in the pharmacy is very fast-paced. The hardest part of the job is handling insurance information, but after a while you get the hang of that. My advice is to not let the customers ruin your day, it's not worth it."
good,My experience at cvs was really good.. I liked it. The management was understanding when it came to family matters and personal matters.. they taught me at my pace and listened to my needs. They waited till I fully understood what it was that I was supposed to b doing for the work they had me doing.. everyday I learned something new.. overall it was a great experience and I enjoyed working there..
good,"If you live close to the facility, it really is a good place to work. Management is really focused on developing you within whatever career path you choose."
good,I have been with CVS for 7 years . The hardest part of the job is working short staffed. My most enjoyable part of the job is working together as a team to work towards one goal.
good,As a Lead Tech at CVS start the day off with attending to early customer and filling scripts. Data entry and inventory are also done to help maintain the balance of medication on hand.
good,"Nice place to work, I just couldn't deal with the funny hours. It's a 24hour establishment so you were inclined to work any of those hours. Not much room for a personal life if you had second shift. Kinda hard to take off for emergencies like appointments and such. But overall, I liked the security of the job, the room for advancement and the different positions offered in one building."
good,They are a good company with excellent benefits and pay. Its a high stress job dealing with members medication. Problem solving and Multitasking a must
good,I have been with CVS for the latter part of 6 years now. I have had some ups and downs but I would say it is an okay place to work. I have had a good time with my managers but the busy shopping seasons can be difficult. I feel I have learned a lot about socialization with clientele at CVS but seeing all my friends at my job was very enjoyable.
good,"Typically on the night shift you would stock, face and clean the store while also checking out customers. Very simple job yet the pay is minimum wage."
good,Very fast paced day goes by very fast. Enjoy helping customers on their way to better health. Also we can help people stay healthy because some people without medications wouldn't be able to live.
good,"My main responsibility was setting up our patients profiles for the new homes and all that were transferred from Central Florida Pharmacy.  I created profiles and set up med sheet information for our nursing home, assisted living facilities and group home residents."
good,"The only thing that I feel is not done correctly at my job is the hourly pay rate. The retail side of CVS is the most important part. We are the face of CVS, the people who interact with the customers the most. Yet we get paid the least."
good,"In the work place we are constantly moving with very little room for breaks, if one doesn't mind this the work place is overall pretty good.     But in order for things to run smoothly, the pharmacist needs to have complete competency, which sometimes you don't always get."
good,The hardest part of the job is trying to help the customer while they are being racist towards you. Customers are always right and we should always try to help them regardless of the situation.
good,Teaches you a lot about customer service more than medication. So much pressure is put on you from the company along with giving the store no hours which means the technicians are going to have a rough day. Make sure to be good with customers or you will lose your patients.
good,working in this ware house was great. there was no micro manager. they gave you your work task and that was your duty to finish and complete the work guide daily.
good,"I really love working for cvs but we don't have enough man hours to get our job done fully every day,, the management lets people get away with things they shouldn't , people are always violating Hippa, some employees mess up prescriptions and aren't held on their mistakes"
good,"It is a great job to gain experience and knowledge on the prescription  side of healthcare. You gain knowledge on topics about insurance, drugs and their uses, and you get to meet new people. The hardest part of the job is when it gets busy and if the pharmacy is under staffed then it will get stressful."
good,"It was okay working there, it was sometimes stressful, and the drive out there wasn't fun. My co-workers were sweet people always had me smiling."
good,"Process at least 100 claims a day, identify problems and correct claims, learned drug strengths and conversions, co-worker are helpful and fun. Hardest part of job is system issues. Enjoy medical billing and problem solving."
good,"good place to work,coworker are nice,typical day is is counting,and dispensing drugs,watching out for drug diversions,attending customers,..etc;i learned about the pharmaceutical industry. the most enjoyable part of my job is helping out customers."
good,It's an descent work place nothing to brag about. these past couple of years it became more about numbers. With so much competition between corporations it's expected. Benefits are awesome.
good,I have learned the CVS is very innovative and helps customers on the path to better health The management team is very helpful and informative. My co-workers are very hard-working. What I enjoy the most is seeing  my customer happy and knowing I was the reason for it. I don't really have any hard days except for inventory time.
good,"Very good company to work for "
good,"reshopped , tagged , and faced merchandise "
good,"Its a nice place to work at. I love my pharmacist and my coworkers, the customers are friendly as well. The only thing is sometimes we need more people but due to cuts of hours, one person can end up doing a lot of tasks which might result in severe error."
good,Management was great. Benefits were advantageous. Co-workers were a joy to be around. The goals set were attainable. Employees were rewarded for a job well done.
good,"Working at Omnicare was a challenge. I got to learn a lot about medication, skilled and assisting living facilities."
good,I enjoy retails sales. Multi-tasking and juggling waves of traffic keep a healthy level of stress in the work atmosphere.
good,At CVS we have a very good team. Always talkative yet got the job done. AT stressful moments we help each other the most to decrease stress.
good,The hardest part of the job was getting the meds out to their destination on time
good,"CVS has been very flexible through out my college years which I really appreciate. I love my store and co workers, the environment is pleasant and  respectful making it easy for everyone to communicate effectively."
good,I have learned much in my time at CVS pharmacy. I have learned to be very self-sufficient and how to lead people. I loved working with the amazing people most of all. I take a lot with me as I try to move up.
good,"I started out enjoying my work at Caremark as is evidenced by the fact that I worked there for almost 19 years. The work was easy, and the benefits were great and I got along well with my coworkers. In fact I had planned to work at Caremark until I retired. But then the company went through some changes and my job was phased out."
good,"It's a great company but it is opened 24/7 365 days a year. There are a couple different shift that comes with different ebnifits and pro's and con's. it's a long term care pharmacy meaning it deals with nursing home patient only. You fill scripts for new patients daily and refills everyday. The pharmacy fills about 5,000 prescriptions a day."
good,"Typical work day. Clock in, Work the register, stock, work the photo center, developing photos, cleaning machine, an running machine productivity tests. running out homeless people who were coming in daily shoplifiting."
good,Face pace work flow with great support staff. Hardest part is seeing some of the nicest people one could ever meet go. I love what I do.
good,"I had always planned schedule for the day. I learned assisting customers, patients over the phone. I also learned resolving insurance plan issuses by contacting account managers, putting overrides. I loved my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was extansive overtime hours but I enjoy to get things done."
good,I loved working at Cvs. Seeing customers smile made my job worthwhile. Stressful during peak time. Having a tight  team around helped make work go smooth
good,"Work was fun, learned a lot while being a technician and enjoyed helping customers.  The only think I did not like is the hours. I went from being part-time (even though I was told it would be full-time)  to not working for a month and some weeks. The manager of the store really tried his best to get me hours, which I greatly appreciated, but it only worked so much. If you apply there, make sure you're getting everything that was offered to you."
good,Iv learned great costumer service there most of all .Iv had to learn how to use the register and ring people up. Iv mostly was on register ringing people up and had to learn how to bag there item's.
good,"I enjoy working for CVS, they have a good and safe work place. And good benefits. The staff makes you feel welcome when you show up for work.And I enjoy serving my customers to better health."
good,Cvs has great employees who always have team work no matter if they don`t like you or not. Retaliation is not permitted at CVS it could lead to termination if this rule is broken. If you have children or are a a shift supervisor who loves to work then this is the perfect job for you
good,"working was great, I got alone with everyone including the manager. Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers. I rarely had a problem with customers however."
good,"Log in to all systems needed for the day we used about 3 on multiple computer screens."
good,"Great job, must be able to be on your feet. Good management. Not a lot of breaks though because we be so busy. able to count pills and stock properly. Able to handle customer problems and help them."
good,if you love to help others this is a good place to be very service oriented and there a lots of bonuses and incentives for employees. never a dull moment in this fast paced call center.
good,"I found it difficult, not because of the job itself, but because of the staff changes and with a different staff came different ways of doing things. I loved doing inventory. Counting medications, translating the  prescriptions to the bottle, getting the medications, and putting medicine back in stock was easy, but each person I was watched by said I should do it different which made things confusing and increasinly difficult."
good,I've worked for this company for almost 18 yrs and the people I've met throughout the years I have considered my second family
good,It was good enviroment loved waking up going too work and making sure my customers was satisfied and not having too call back I just want too make sure their an one  time caller and not an repeat
good,learned a lot about insurance and medical; good co-workers;
good,CVS Health is a great company to work. They promote talent with in the company. Great management career opportunities.
good,"Good MAnagement"
good,working for cvs i felt like there wasnt any room to grow. Most of the management was replaced requently.sometimes it felt like there was a different boss every week. over all i did enjoy my time at cvs. i liked the idea that i was helping people with there heath care needs.
good,"I wish to further my career as a pharmacy technician i learned allot on medication and how it should be handled, how to deal with customer and pleasing they're needs."
good,"A typical day at work would depend on your store location."
good,"great company to work for. hardworking management and staff, great products made affordably. Pharmacy is on the ball and always helps out customers when they need it."
good,"Good company to start working, eventually you should considering moving out to keep working in your professional carreer."
good,Bust filling scripts for a 24 hour store. Getting to know patients was the most enjoyable parts. The hardest part was we were always short handed and I could not assist everyone in a timely manner. The co-workers were fun and easy to communicate with. Management was good and very helpful.
good,CVS is a really wonderful place to work the customers are brutally honest and friendly even when they don't have to be. CVS has great benefits and opporntunity for advancement within the company
good,"it's an excellent job, but currently being payed far below a pharmacy technician's salary."
good,i felt comfortable with the staff.the staff was very nice and helpful.
good,A normal day for me would be ringing up customers and entering online photo orders. I would also check for outdates so there wouldn't be anything that people who spend hours looking for expired products. I would also open up and unwrap makeup so the beauty person can put them on the shelves (this gave me something to do).
good,I loved the work place and loved that it was a fast paced job also. The mangers where very down to earth and easy to work with. They always explained what needed to be done carefully.
good,I like working for cvs they have very good programs that help there employees with their future. they also have friendly staff and is overall a great company to work for .
good,"Working here allowed me to easily pick up hours and it also allowed me to level up, I started off as a cashier and was asked by management if I wanted to take the course for pharmacy training."
good,the job is not bad as long as you mind your business and do your job. Make rate pick accurately you won’t have a problem. Some people have been there for 20+ and they think they own the place. I don’t pay them no mind because they don’t sign my paycheck
good,"I like work there to help peoples and there"
good,Cvs was a great place to work the opportunity are endless but when your trying to move up within the company and focus on the things to get u promoted it’s to do that with a store manager who doesn’t wanna train u or who always wanna leave when u come in to start your shift it got to the point where I gave up on trying to move up in the company.
good,"The company take proud in what their do, loving and protecting their employee,they believe in education by helping employees to go back to school."
good,Although you spend a large amount of time sitting your time is well spent knowing that you have contributed to completing billing cycle of reimbursement. My co-workers were great people to work with.
good,A typical day not so busy. Making sure the customers were helped in a professional way. Meeting with supervisors and maintaining the inventory that arrived. All my co-workers very good workers and easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job was making sure my employee's pulled there own wait. The most enjoyable days were when we all flow as a team.
good,It was a nice place and the people were interesting. I would have liked a little more hands on training from management
good,"I am the ""lead tech"" in the mornings I come in and start working on the rejected prescriptions in the que, after doing that I start filling the prescriptions (15 on a page) there's usually 4-5 pages and I usually get the que cleared before the next tech comes in which is 11am. After doing that I do the daily cycle counts,help make dr calls, type prescriptions that get called in,dropped off, faxed, or electronically prescribed. In the meantime we have an outside vender which we order medications from and I check that in and complete the pending inventory. I love working with people and enjoy helping them. The worst part of my job is the other pharmacy emplyees because they do the least possible and don't do more that expected from them and it makes my job harder and more stressful because I end up printing their labels and pulling their medications to get them working faster"
good,"Great Opportunity to learn and welcoming environment. The management staff are great, and the workers are usually happy. It may be stressful, but you can count on your team."
good,I liked working at my externship site I did learn a lot and the people made me feel like I was part of the team and made me feel welcome and always willing to give me a hand or answer my questions
good,The company focuses more on the customers than its employees.
good,"-Every day is so out of control, you never know what to expect"
good,"Great employees, and I love working in customer service. Very accommodating with my hours. My only concern was with how expensive everything is at CVS. Most of the time the store is open on holidays. Why would CVS be open normal hours on Thanksgiving??"
good,Hours fluctuated greatly from one day to the next. Many shifts were dropped so had to fill in for others last minute. Managers asking to fill multiple roles without much guidance.
good,Sweat shop with horrible phone system. I learned how to do my job not from the trainer but from a previous employer. Very odd place to work. I don't recommend unless you''re flat broke.
good,"The days are very challenging but can be a wonderful experience when dealing with some of your favorite customers and coworkers.  You will have to stand for long hours but that will be something you will get used to and working long shifts.  The job is not a fair one in advancement in any position pharmacy related depending on location, however, in larger areas you will have better opportunities."
good,"Management decides on what rules to follow and what ones to break. The customers are the best part of the job , getting to meet people  and hear their stories was great. Management will beat around the bush about any and everything , just so that they don't have to tell employees the truth. Very stressful , but that all falls on management. Great place to work if you get in with the right group of co workers and managers."
good,Being able to say that I did everything in my power to make sure a member was well taken care of.
good,"Great place to work. Fun, fast-paced. Team effort. Unfortunately, you have to deal with angry and upset customers."
good,not treat the employees all the same
good,"Basic benefits such as tuition reimbursement, medical, dental etc. Very excellent job. Can be busy and overwhelming at times but once you get use to it and get in a rhythm the job is fairly easy"
good,Benefits were good overall good place to work. Would recommend. Pay was on the lower range. Work life balance was good. Corporate was very meticulous.
good,"I loved the position as a pharmacy trainee. I enjoyed my work, customers, and the some of the people I worked with. Just didn't care for the cutting, dicing, and chopping of hours. Especially, when I was a kidney transplant patient and my husband was disabled I had to work."
good,some time stressed but nice management always helpful co worker and management clean store and very respectful to customers i will recommend to work there because of nice management but pay is ok.
good,always have things to do just the problem never enough staff to work with trying to do one thing as a manager but you cant really because you are all over the place running around. But you do learn a lot of stuff too.
good,feels like a full time job even though it was a part-time. the customers will truly make or break your day so be as kind to them as you can. be there to help your team when needed. No one likes a lazy team mate.
good,"Often management has no concept of work/life balance."
good,"It was an alright place to work, doesnt pay much but they are very flexible and are willing to help you learn. The only thing that was hard about this job was knowing where to find each drug and making sure that you have the right medication."
good,i just love to help people that's what I want to do. I was helping people every day and that makes everything else worth while
good,I reviewed closed claim notes and then in my own words write a clinical summary of what I read.  The I would have to code to what best described the note.The co-workers that I worked with were wonderful and team players.  It made this job very enjoyable.
good,"the job itself was okay, but I wanted more money. the business was great and the manager was very respectful. the job was very easy though at times we  were very busy."
good,"CVS does not mind that its employees only half way do their job. The store manager assigns tasks unfairly. Store 8983 needs to be investigated because the store manager don't mind people steal from the store. He feels his job is on the line so he doesn't want to ruin his job. He knows employees fix their time when they are late and wont do anything about it. He lies to his associates and the only one who has special treatment is the shift supervisor he is ""close to""."
good,I did my internship here for 400 hours while I finished college. There was alot that I learned. They taught me alot.
good,Very stressful place to work. No one is ever happy. No one works as a team.
good,not a bad job but they work you to death. upper management is terrible not much room for advancement. Job itself is not bad but dealing with the hours and management makes it not a fun place to work
good,CVS required a lot when they hire you they tell you it's from 7:00 am until 3:30pm but when you start it's nothing like that.  It's a lot of starting new ways of bettering things and when you get use to it they stop it .
good,"A typical day varies from store to store, but overall it will depend if the  bigwigs will give you enough hours to finish all the work your store requires. Sometimes we do, sometimes we don't and the store is graded on performance. A bad performance is a reduction in hours and the cycle begins anew the next week."
good,"Compensation was kind of terrible for the amount of work they make you do. Customers are always a handful, irrational but you have to deal with them with no emotional reactions. Staff is nice, employee discount and sales/merchandise is good. Scheduling is rough, either you have too many shifts or too little. Most of the time it was so busy you don't even get a break."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was the daily interaction with customers. This career provided multiple opportunities  to enhance and grow as a young manager.
good,Decent place to work with flexible hours   Definitely room for growth for the employees. Insurance benefits are very good and beneficial. They offer 401k and also an employee benefit program.
good,work is stressful. always behind. Pharmacy manger is not helpful and refused to speak with upset patients. The technicians are awesome! wonderful patients. Would be an awesome job if it were to have better management.
good,It was an interesting place to work.  I learned a lot on the job training as well as testing.  Working with the public can be difficult but rewarding as well.
good,"management is always changing and is horrible, management pick favorites. "
good,"A typical day at CVS includes working at different stations throughout the day including: data entry, filling prescriptions and answering phones, and retail customer service. I have worked at multiple locations when I have moved because of school, or because of the military. There is only one position available as management, and you must have years of full time work to become a lead technician. The workplace is always hectic, but respectable. The hardest part of the job would be rude and unhappy patients. I have enjoyed this job because of the good patients, and allowing me to get a great background in healthcare."
good,"Management went from great to not-so-great. As a part time worker, I never felt I was getting paid enough for the extreme amount of work I would do and the pay is subpar."
good,"A typical day at work is very strenuous. On your feet the entire day, customers are rarely nice. Co-workers are often snippy and enjoy way to much workplace gossip."
good,"nice place to work, front store management was great to work with,pharmacy management was ok to work with,coworkers were ok alot of two faced people,the hardest part of the job was finding time to do everything corp. wanted you to do,and working short handed all the time, the best thing about it was nothing"
good,"Although I enjoy working there with my co-workers, I do not fully agree with management and the way they operate. I also do not like the fact that my hours are unstable, which makes my pay unstable."
good,CVS can be a fun place to work if you find the right pharmacy. Otherwise it's poorly run by corporate and tends to leave you feeling exhausted daily. Good luck on trying to get raises or advancements though.
good,I would recommend the CVS Caremark to people who are looking for an opportunity to learn new things with regards to the Medicare Part D program.
good,"I am a lead cashier. As long as you work honestly you are fine. corporate level managers are not really smart. They make weird decisions and after sometime they take that decisions back. "
good,"I like the job but there was poor communication between supervisors and employees.  Got fired for not coming in on a Saturday, was not told it was mandatory until Friday night with working my regular shift. I worked 13 hours the night before from 4pm to 5:30am and wanted me to come back in at 1pm which its a half hour drive where I live.  I enjoyed working with this company.  I learned a lot of things and wish I never got fired."
good,I loved the work environment and the job requirements. However the management was poorly kept and ran terribly.
good,"The CVS company offers on the job training for its employee in the pharmacy, which is really good, most places don't do that anymore. So that is one of the pros of working there. The cons of working their is there is inequality among co-workers. That being some ore considered better than others based solely off of how much time they have been employed there. Now it's one thing if you have been there for a while and you do your job well, but being employed for so long and them allowing you to be lazy is another thing. Scheduling gets a little hectic because they don't consider that you have a family or that you are in school. By law they have to respect the availability as it changes but even still they have issues with doing that also."
good,Omnicare is a good company but upper management will not listen to suggestions to operate better.
good,"I was sent there from a temp agency and I did not like the management team there at all. It is mostly team leads who do not know what they are doing and will report you to the big boss if they do not like you, you will get fired. Management needs a lot of work"
good,"My over all experience I had with CVS wasn’t so bad, the lack of pay was terrible.  I had to work long overtime hours just to make ends meet. Took time from my family."
good,"Chaotic and way overwhelmed. Unable to break through the culture that did not include a level of urgency. Great possibilities for the right team."
good,"I enjoyed the job, the people and benefits. But the pay, and opportunity for advancement needs work. The job itself was okay too. My issue was the work life balance. They would have mandatory overtime and tell you the day of and when you could work it."
good,"this would be a very good company to work for however we are watching the time from the time we get to work until we leave for the day. Management is good, however they are pushed by numbers."
good,I liked my co workers and my patients Iearned a lot during my time working here. Enjoyed working in Tempe not so much at Mesa store. I don’t think Tech’s get enough credit. Benefits could be better for employees with children.
good,I worked 70 hours a week.  I did not have a work/life balance.  I was not appreciated for what I did.  There was no room for advancement in my field.  My associates were not willing to change the status quo.
good,My day starts with checking in supplies and removing out dated merchandise.  I pick up different abilities day to day. Management is good with keeping us up to date on new products and productivity.  It's a fast paste job.  The most enjoyable part of the day is interacting with the customers.  You meet a variety of people and all ages.
good,Honestly this was one of the best jobs I've ever worked. The atmosphere was laid back yet structured nicely and my fellow employees were friendly and jovial people.
good,CVS requires you to do a bunch of modules on your down time. It's almost like homework. The training is pretty mediocre so by time you're ready to work on your own you still have absolutely no idea what you're doing.
good,This was agreat n starting place to a pharmacy tech. there is conpounding .This part of pharmacy had to do with  transplant patient  .always something to learn.
good,"staff was great, customers were some times jerks, we were robbed, there was no rotation so it was hard to gain experience in a position that was occupied. management needed someone that was friends with the staff so the work schedule was far."
good,"I would not recommend anyone to work here, it was not a good experience. The company is too big and the supervisors do not take the time to work with the new employees. You either know what you are doing off hand, or you don't."
good,"Overall it is a great place to start, so that you can gain experience. But with time you realize they don't pay you enough for the stuff you go through with customers and management."
good,"I enjoyed my job at CVS but I could not stay do to me in school and they couldnt work around my schedule. I stocked shelves, check costumers out on registers, light inventory, and making sure everything is kept up."
good,"The co-workers work great together. We never seem to have enough staff, as the days are always busy. The pharmacist are always willing to step in when needed to help at the registers or answer phones."
good,Overall a rewarding place to work for if you like helping people daily. The job can be a lot to handle at times so I wouldn't suggest it for those who are easily stressed.
good,"I learned everything I know now about how to be a professional in a work environment here. The problem was compensation. They did not and do not believe in paying decent wages. Bonuses were only a couple of hundred dollars a quarter while the company made billions. "
good,"The job is simple. I worked as a cashier. I typical handled transactions or customer inquiries,"
good,I was working as a pharmacy technician there and I can say its a great job to do if you want to pursue a pharmacy degree but if you want to continue as a pharmacy technician you better work in non retail enviroment
good,LTC pharmacy is a fun place to work if you enjoy hand packing medications. It was a pretty good work environment.
good,Retail experience with no sleep. There was not a great deal of pressure. Management was good at explaining things. They were very picky though about advancement. I liked the fact I could work all night and have the day time to do stuff. But I hated how tired I was after 6 nights in a row.
good,workplace has potential to be a great environment. Co-workers were great
good,"responsible for the front end and all money transactions and also the pharmacy,duties included were filling and dispensing of medications and superior customer service."
good,"I have worked at CVS for many years. I work closely with customers and have learned a lot about customer service over the years. Managers are all different and take different approaches to running each store. I enjoy my co-workers and fine it easy to get along with them. The hardest part of the job is not being able to please every customer, I hate to send someone away unhappy. I love helping customers make photos and relive happy memories."
good,"CVS was a great company. It made me grow as a person and it taught me a lot in reference to managrment, customer service and people in general. I do not think the opportunity for growth is present though."
good,"filled medications for customers. worked under Pharmisists supervision, learned compounding creams, and solutions. fast paced, accuracy was important."
good,I’ve worked at CVS Health for 3 years and I have not been promoted from a cashier to a shift lead/shift manager. The store manager has been dancing around it for months. CVS Corporate took away time and a half on holidays. CVS is now open 365 days a year.
good,You will work extra hard for the money and no work life balance due to mandatory overtime.  Work environment was very harsh due to the age of the facility and very dirty.
good,"During my time in both the Minnetonka and Eden Prairie COE's, there was growth potential as well as a variety of jobs. Management encouraged your growth through one on one meetings as well as direct access to your leads & supervisors."
good,Not very much room for growth. Very clickish. Low moral. Management sometimes has no idea of certain processes. Often inappropriate joke and comments.
good,"I have worked at CVS in various positions for 2 years. The job isn't hard, but the upper management is awful. They expect more out of a team than they can give while cutting hours and adding extra tasks. Its honestly too much."
good,Although fun at times it takes an extremely organized and meticulous person to work there. It is a highly stressful and fast paced job. It is not for everyone. Especially in the pharmacy.  I personally love it because there is always something new to learn and different to do.
good,People working there are great depending on locations. Workload is also depending on locations. Most managers I encountered were nice. They should pay people a bit more.
good,"when originally hired I was receiving suitable hours and pay. over the period of time I have been there m hours have dramatically decreased and wa advised that If I needed more hours I could pick the up at other stores. i chose that particular location for a reason and do not feel that I should be calling other stores to to get descent hours,"
good,Typical day would included face to face interaction with customers.
good,"Very stressful company to work for, too many responsibilities and too many unresolved changes.  They have lots of opportunities, but Leadership will hold you back."
good,Unless you are starting out into the work force or are looking to work management i would not recommend. It started out fun but then turned into a numbers game.
good,"I worked at CVS Health call center.  All my supervisors and trainers were great, except for the last one.   The supervisor was recently promoted and was not aware of how to communicate with individuals in a productive manner.    The supervisor would send emails to their team, stating do this (whatever needed to be done) or I will write you up and you might be terminated.  That would be the first time we were instructed to do XYZ.  Most every other supervisor is great to work with/for."
good,"The company and the job it self was great, I was trained not only for phones, online, and emails, enjoyed learning about Behavior Analytics. The management never chose my or kept me in the loop on all the infusions. They broke my spirits."
good,"Nice people, easy but interesting work. Management is clueless, human resources is outsourced and impossible to deal with. If you have half a brain you can make a small steady paycheck here."
good,"I love my job st cvs in California, but when I transferred to Oregon they made me float all over Oregon. I got to be exhausting. It's a great company if they gave more hours"
good,"I love working at the pharmacy and enjoy the people I work with to a certain extent but the customers get on my nerves sometimes. They, along with mid and upper management are needy, demanding, expect you to work anytime even though I have a primary job and they strive on flexible schedules. At first, I would recommend CVS to everyone who's interested in retail pharmacy but if not, use CVS for the experience and move on to something better."
good,Cvs was a good company to get started in pharmacy with but was not competitive with wages. People were great but corporate wanted to much from their employees.
good,long work hrs ok pay great benefits didnt have  very good work life balance theu tried coworkers had a lot of drama good management
good,"The company was not employee friendly. The type of work is amazing. The knowledge of prescription dynamics and prescription plans and how the work, were a life long skill."
good,"It was unorganized. We help people out with refills on prescription, help them understand their insurance and balances. Replace insurance cards."
good,Very good place to get a head start on learning the pharmacy world. Everyone has a good opportunity to learn and grow and the meaning of teamwork.
good,Steady workload with chances to learn new skills.  Management is entrenched and co-workers either cut-throat or squatting until Social Security kicks in. Hardest of all is that the company isn't serious about investing in furthering education or tuition reimbursement.
good,Medco got bought and kicked all them out in NJ.  Being sweared at in meetings is very common and you better have thick skin.  They all found a home in CVS and hired each other qualified or not.  The work life balance is not there and there is no investment or IT only projects for the business.  If you are not on the East Coast you there is little chance to advance.
good,"This company was the first place out of pharmacy school that allowed me to apply my skills that I learned into the real world. It was fun while it lasted. It then got to a point where we were micromanaged, over worked and underpaid."
good,"CVS was helpful to given me knowledge in the pharmacy.  From entry data, and filling medications throughout the day.  Calculated doses for patient/customers and understand insurance payment or issues."
good,"I loved this company. I loved the location, the benefits, and the work I was doing. The Data Center is seriously something to behold. However, management was terrible. Sadly due to the economic down turn CVS ended up laying off 1000 of us. If not for that experience the job would have been perfect."
good,On a typical tuesday . we get a truck and we join hands to make sure the truck is put up and at the same time make sure the customers are taken care of as well..The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know employees and customers as well..Management is firm but fair.
good,This job does not compensate their employees for the hard work they put in. The company itself provides wonderful services to the patients. I enjoy doing my job because each verification I do means a patient gets to go home from the hospital.
good,Busy taking orders was a typical day at work. I learned there are plenty of people in the country on medication that for some is easier to have it mailed rather than have to go to a local pharmacy to pick up their medication. Management was okay there. It was more of the company that didn't work well with you if you had a family emergency or medical issue. Management just followed the company's procedures. Co-workers were great but not everyone was appreciated. Hardest part of the job was being able to balance family life and working there. There really wasn't an enjoyable part of working with a company that couldn't work with a person's home life and work.
good,"I started to work at a night shift. I was working full-time. After several years I asked to transfer me to the day shift. With much persistence I got it."
good,"I as a supervisor, I work at the register and assist with purchasing choices, I love to suggest sell to our customers. "
good,"CVS mission is to trully please the customers, that is something that  I can personally confirm all meetings and trainings surround the customers and our purpose in relation to them. A typical day at work is very busy, we produced over 400 perscriptions a day. My co workers are very knowledgeble, and know what they are doing. The hardest part of this job are the long hours. The most enjoyable part is the different people you have the potential of meeting and the ability to be in a position to help someone who is need of pharmaceutical attention the best way possible."
good,I learned all about retail pharmacy and was able to get state certified through cvs. Manager was very new and believe was not a good fit.
good,"Working for CVS is a very productive and friendly job. You help people. Whether its to find medicine, food, make up, any product. You get to help make friendly recommendations to products. You get to meet meet new people everyday. Your on the cash register for the most part of the day ringing people up."
good,"some of the co workers are nice while some are not so much. but hey, where can you go and NOT find that?"
good,"A typical day at work might consist of solving costumer issues; such as satisfying costumers needs. I have learned that in this work field costumer service is one of the key term. At the end of a costumer's shopping experience we want to make sure it was pleasurable and we also want them to leave with a great impression that their needs were taken care of, so that they can remain interested in our business. Most of my co workers get along well with each other, but sometimes there are lack of communication and different levels of effort put into the the job, that can make things go down hill. The hardest part of my job is being used for my intelligence and don't get rewarded for my knowledge and hard work. the most enjoyable part of this job is dealing with different faces everyday and learning something new every time and i enjoy so much task, it keeps me busy."
good,"CVS pharmacy has given me an experience to communicate with customers, establish a good customer-cashier relationship. This workplace has allowed to get more experience related to the accountability of cash, working in a team, being responsible doing all the tasks assigned to me."
good,"I absolutely loved the people I worked with. They made the work day go by smoothly. Management was willing to work with anything to help make your life easier. Corporate on the other hand, they do not look out for their employees. They look over them and only care about money, not customers."
good,At CVS I was able to meet and socialize with customers and employees which made me happy. They do have a very friendly and clean atmosphere.
good,This position has taught me to use limited resources to perform the job. Customer service is the main focus and the hardest part of the job is providing excellent customer service with out any help. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people everyday and touching their lives in some way.
good,"Decent place to work, work from home is a possibility at some locations."
good,"It wasn't the job, it was the uncoordinated and workers were lazy, but still had a job. Management wasn't really professional with certain issues or complaints by other workers"
good,CVS is a good place to work but it can turn stressful when management is poor.  Customers are the priority and maintaining the floor nice and clean and as well as providing customer service
good,will become busy and stressful at time but will also be slow. customers are sometimes rude and will not hesitate to be rude. managers are sometimes unrealistic with requests.
good,Company is good towork for and the job can be stressful at times!! Management in some departments are awful!!  It's a buddy system with some of the managment which is what makes the company worse!! Some of the management should not be in the positions because they are not good with people. Some of management is power stuck.
good,"The worst part about the job was the breaks. Even if you worked a 9 hour shift, which was very so often, you would only receive a 30 min break. The management was not the greatest and it was extremely difficult to request a day off or switch shifts with someone if something came up last minute."
good,"The work days can get very repetitive. I've worked in many stores and I've had pleasant times but my current store is what i signed up for, as I'm typing this i would've worked 9 days straight if i didn't call in on Friday. My manager is very disrespectful towards me all because i called off 1 day even though it was my birthday and I requested it off weeks ago."
good,"Good job, but pretty difficult business (depending on location) I love the work I do but, we just don’t have enough support from management to get any real work done."
good,Store has plenty things to do. There are planograms for displays. There is truck day where you empty the truck. Tag day where the tags come down and new ones go up. Easyto do. Get along with most everyone.
good,"a typical day at work i am normal counting medicatons, helping customers out by refilling their meds. I as well am constantly calling the doctors to verify medications out. I as well interact with insurance which is by far the hardest thing I've had to learn."
good,The workplace consisted of very polite individuals and the management of understanding. The only real problem that had occurred was the distance from the job to my home.
good,How can you expect people to do job well but dont have enough employees to work not enough hours to have proper staff having to be full time a year before getting benigits
good,"It was overall a nice place to work, but not enough hours available to work. Also low salary for technicians while requiring CPhT certification. This company will pay for test and certification costs."
good,The job is not so horrible if you don’t mind getting yelled at all the time by customers and workers alike. There’s always a huge issue with corporate that makes working there similar to working in a Ferris wheel on fire.
good,"This job is pretty straight forward but very slow paced. Hopefully business will grow and become profitable. You open clean and close. that is the whole 8 hour day,"
good,"Most businesses have loyal customers especially at CVS. We have an loyal customer that was a veterans and one day he wanted to find a specific type of reading glasses because he just broke the one he have. With courage i wanted him to get what he wanted because if he didn't he would be upset all day. We search until my lunch break when I clock  out for my break and saw how disappointed our veteran  was, it affected me that he was upset so instead of eat lunch i search for the glasses in the storage boxes and found a pair of the same glasses but they was pink. I called veteran to come see if he still wanted the pair of glasses and lucky he third favorite color was pink."
good,I love working there though I haven't been there long. The Head Tech doesn't like to train the new technicians. It's not as organized as it should be.
good,"The greatest part of this job was dealing with customers when they were at their worst and being able to make them feel better. The only down fall was that to succeed further you would need to go to school and at the time it was not an option for me. That particular job was rewarding because it taught me alot of valuable skils ie:computer, and people skills."
good,"came into work  when I scheduled and done my duties."
good,"I enjoyed working there. Not very difficult work. As technician you are constantly busy entering prescriptions, counting and labeling and customer service."
good,a typical  day would consits of login in to your station calling doctors in putting data into the system for review .all these things must be done at a certain pace. which is monitored by management
good,"Good place to work while trying to find another career, pay is way too low. Flex sched give opportunity to take classes.  Would be great full time job but pay is way too low"
good,I enjoy the adrenaline and fast pace. I have learned to manage and run a pharmacy efficiently and productively. I want to continue to impact lives and learn about new medical techniques and medications that will create a better future for my patients.
good,very reputable company to work for. #1 in their Home Infusion field. High standards.
good,"I have nothing negative or positive to say about CVS. Overall, I left because the low salary given the level of responsibility and poor medical benefits."
good,Depends on what store you work at and how management is there but for the most part CVS provides quality care for patients. The workplace culture is great
good,management is far from professional and for a company that is representing health and caring for the wellbeing of the community it seemed like they where always more concerned with producing fast numbers without regard for the costumers or employees.
good,My duties included addressing the day-today needs of clients and participants. Management was unconcerned with helping their staff maintain a healthy work life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was the lack of resources provided by management to efficiently perform in one's role.
good,"Working at CVS I learned a lot especially becoming an inventory specialist where I handled the day to day inventory of the pharmacy. There was always something new to learn, It was a great learning experience.The most enjoyable thing about my job was interacting with different people and learning something new all the time. It was a little stressful but it was nothing that I could't handle."
good,"The best part of this job is assisting people with an area of their lives that they know very little about, and an area that is in constant change. "
good,This company needs a lot of improvements. Not a a typical 9-5 company- always looking to add responsibilities without increasing your compensation.  I dislike the culture.here- super negative!
good,"I worked back to back shifts, closing one night and opening next morning.  My health suffered and manager could care less.  I started to float to end the back to back shifts."
good,"lots of PTO time, very poor management"
good,"I really enjoyed working there.  Different job roles made it interesting.  The only reason I left was mandatory overtime.  If we didn't do it were threatened with termination.  I was required to come in at 530 am when my hours were to start at 7 am. With a child in daycare that didn't open that early, I was forced to give my notice.  I would go back in a heartbeat though, if they had part time."
good,A lot of time and money is spent on traveling for this company.  They do reimburse you for your travel however expectations of facility contacts do not work with the distance required to travel for them.  I love the company and have worked for them for a long time.  I have gone through 3 personal vehicles so the money and time spent on the road was not reimbursed enough to spend that amount of money on cars that were destroyed working.  The account visit expectation is not realistic considering the amount of work you must completed once done for the day in Sales Force documentation and catching up on emails from work and customers.
good,I entered prescriptions into the computer.Management was ok. the hardest part of my job was to know left eye from right eye. most enjoyable part was the people that worked there.
good,New manager came in and nobody wants to work here anymore. she's ignorant and cuts your hours really badly. 5 people quit because of her. she's the worst manager. other then her CVS is an amazing place to work
good,"CVS Health is a fun place to work, but the way things are done throughout the company are ways that they have been done for so many years. It is like they fail to move on with the advancement of how things are moving in society."
good,"Ringing up customers and managing inventory every day."
good,"there were certain teams for every part of the call center. it was more of knowing someone to advance not having good work ethic. people who were never on time, always took multiple breaks for 30 mins at a time were the ones who got promoted. I loved saying I worked for cvs specialty and I treated my patients like they were my family but their goal was to sell more meds to dying patients and call them ""customers"" then sit there and call them patients and make sure they are doing okay and in need of assistance... if you have a big heart this would be a hard job to do because you get disciplined for having a conversation with the patient. they acted like we were selling tv service.."
good,"As a pharmacy technician, we pull the medications off the shelves and count them individually by hand. Once that is complete we give the prescriptions to the pharmacist who then checks each script in detail to make sure that what the doctor wrote is fully carried out. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS MANDATORY!! At CVS we pride ourselves on great customer service. That is what keeps us going. The hardest part of the job is dealing with insurance companies when they refuse to pay for a medication. The best part about the job is getting to see those regular customers on a daily basis. They make me like what I do."
good,"A typical day at would be clocking in and asking the manager what it is that they wanted me to do or if there was anything that I could do. Usually I would stock shelves, check inventory, do store beautification, and help customers with their questions. What I learned from this position was communicative skills. The management was nice and helpful. The workplace culture was usually very professional and productive. There were no hard parts about this job. The most enjoyable part of this job was learning how stores run."
good,A typical day at work is very busy. You will need to know how to multitask greatly! also you would need to be able to pay attention to detail. You must be able to stand for a long period of time!
good,"Shifts start between 07:00-07:30.  You get 2 15 min breaks on the clock. You get 1 30 min lunch off the clock.  Warehouse job. Most of the management doesn't care about employees unless you are female, cute and willing to flirt with them."
good,"Called the patient insurance to see if the prior auth is approved to be able to send out patient medication. "
good,Business culture that consumes technology and technology culture that follows the business.  Technology leadership is reactive not visionary.  No projects get approved unless it makes an impact for a business line so shared services are the red headed step child.
good,while my coworkers were great it was a demanding work environment especially during the beginning of the year with new prior auths coming in.
good,"Good company to be with, but can be difficult to advance.  Managers are placed where there is a need.  Training not typically given.  Learn as you go education."
good,"Job can be very stressful at times. Very limited staff, must have structure to be successful. I love the discounts that the company gives to the colleagues. Place a lot of work on a particular store."
good,They are a good company to work for but are don't always treat there employees correctly. I have worked there for 4 years an feel like I need to movie on cause I am not always respected.
good,the work is busy and fast paced. I've learned that even upper management can be wrong. The co*workers are kind and willing to help out when needed. The most enjoyable part of this job was feeling that you finished the job and on time.
good,"My 10 years working for Omnicare /Cvs has been a great experience for me. Some day was good and some days was not. There were time when management, co-workers got on your nerves and times when everyone had a good. There was also tit for tat situation but for the most important part the work got don."
good,Everyday was different.  It may be incredibly busy or slow.  We always have meeting of each team to discuss the needs of the referral.  I learned to work with others and go with the flow of work.
good,"stressful"
good,Help process customers prescriptions and also ring up customer when ready to pay. When needed I would go out and stock the pharmacy over the counter shelves to insure in stock.
good,"The processing of over 250 prescriptions were very busy, which I enjoyed a great deal. I learned that the company has great ideas and learning procedures on paper, but implementation on in the Pharmacy was almost never done.  This lack of training caused the technician to be slow in the development of the job.  Management did not have the time to teach or to allow the individual to learn because of the pace of the workforce.  The hardest part of the job was the frustration due to the lack of training. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting the customers."
good,"Its a fun workplace, I learn something everyday I work, either with handling people emotion or my own. The mot enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my colleagues and learning from them how to operate around the work place."
good,CVS Health is a great place to start but they offer very little in raises and advancements. The patients at my store are amazing but some can be very demanding as well as rude
good,The night shift was slow but you were able to get a lot done such as cleaning up the store. I also learned that my coworkers we really fun people that helped you stay awake by singing and making work more fun and time seemed to move faster when we all worked together.
good,"I would deliver medication from a pharmacy to nursing homes other pharmacies, and home health facilities. I would drive my own car to do so."
good,The coworkers are nice and take customer service very seriously. My co-workers were all wonderful and my head pharmacist was stern but likable. The hardest part of the job is helping the customers while staying within procedures and laws. It was difficult to keep up with the orders when business was busy but it was enjoyable non the less
good,This place works you to death for low income. No room for advancement. Management is good but corporate doesnt care about you. This is an entry level job for a pharmacy tech..............STAY AWAY!
good,"A great company to work for. "
good,"Fill prescriptions, assist customers, bill insurance, consult with insurance companies to solve billing issues. Management and co-workers needs improving with HIPPA other than that the job is easy and i enjoy going to work and helping my customers, which is what matters the most."
good,i am looking for new employment due to some issues with management.  I am having a lot of problems receiving my benefits.  Some coworkers were great but the pharmacists are hard to work for
good,"The company was great to work for, once upon a time. Some newer management happened higher up and everything started being monitored and rated. The last straw was a flawed system that monitored the communication of any issues to a customer. If you didn't contact a customer for whatever reason you were marked for it, too many marks and you got your district managers attention."
good,"Typical day: Learning experience as a pharmacy tech intern. Observed under the pharmacist, and performed similar duties as a pharmacy technician. Such as, Correctly filling patient medications, and socking and ordering medications."
good,Overall working for them on entry level I learned a lot. Management could stand more extensive training I found that they were unsure of actually company polices. I had a good time in the work place felt like a small family due to small staff.
good,Being able to work in a fast place and my ability to multitask.
good,i like the people i work with and my job but not the fact that i cannot get more money for the work i do is upsetting
good,"There is always something to do, so the day goes by faster. Upper management is a joke."
good,"Working at CVS , is an adventure. The company is Fantastic, the management needs work. Too many hours are expected of the work force. No work/Life balance. I feel they are missing the key element...just because people need the job doesn't make it right to treat your employees any less...MORALS are important...HONESTY is as well!!  You expect the best fro your employees then lead by example!!"
good,"a typical day would consist of order selecting by paper down aisles from pick locations."
good,"We basically start by opening the gates, turning on computers.  We usually have people waiting when the gates are lifted.  We fill thier prescriptions,and answer any questions they may have. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with all the stations.  There are 4 stations for techs and only 4 techs are allowed to work per 1 pharmacist.  For instance you might have to answer the phone and pull drugs for up coming prescriptions that are due soon.  Another instance is waiting on a 2 lane drive thru and counting in between customers.  The customers are usually nice and the co-workers are great."
good,"Work at a very productive store, receive, fill, and deliver medications to variety of patients. Have a very productive and positive workflow, staff is very kind and professional."
good,"Nice place to work with ability to work from home. Nice coworkers, love contract with clients. Love challenges."
good,"I loved working here,it was challenging and kept me intriqued. Everyday was different but everyday was fast-paced and I was responsible for alot of the pharmacy work. I didn't like all the responsibility without compensation and the customers could be crazy at times also."
good,"Filling prescriptions, Customer Service, Counting medications, Labeling bottles, Insurances, HIPPA, etc."
good,"Overall, great place to work.  I have learned a lot and have gained invaluable experience."
good,Good Work..Just Temporary. Answering phone calls and order DME supplies for patients
good,"- Great if you have no work experience and trying to start building that lifestyle "
good,minimum pay rate no raise in a year after providing a notice of resignation come to find out manager said I had abandoned job I did enjoy working there but did not like that the pay was minimum for everything we would do
good,"you do your job and no matter what, some customers will steal."
good,Working at Omnicare allow me to learned medical terminology that I did not know before. I also learned how to multitask with medical records and data entry to make the satisfication level high for our customers
good,"I worked for CVS pharmacy for 2 years. I thoroughly enjoyed my job, but the only reason i stayed so long was because of the people i worked with. All of us technicians were friends outside of work so it made the job more fun. But the management at CVS is ridiculous, all the way up. They are generally understaffed and require you to work yourself to death then get onto you about your hours. The pharamcy i worked at hired 2 brand new pharmacists, and my fellow technicians and i knew more about how to do their job than they did. I had to order C-ii for the pharmacists because they didnt know how. I caught so many mistakes that were made by the pharmacists. I felt like i wasnt getting paid nearly enough to have the responsibilty of my job and the pharmacists and maintaining the entire pharmacy."
good,"If you enjoy a fasted paced environment this is the place for you. I spent most of my day waiting on patients and I really enjoyed helping them. However their were times that the stress got to me, but it is a high stress job. Overall CVS is a great company to work for."
good,"starting off nice place to work, great schedule and productive work flow"
good,"Cvs is a tolerable environment, the team is easy going once you get the hang of things. As soon as everything is afloat the ship sales smoothly from there on out"
good,I enjoyed working at CVS until there was a change in the management.  The new manager was very difficult to work with.  The company itself is a good company but I left after 4 months due to new manager.
good,The training for Medicare Part D was EXCELLENT.   The largest inhibitor was the supervisors did not have adequate training to provide constructive criticism for employees to enhance their performances and provide solid value add for the Corporation.
good,"Very busy store, you have to be able to deal with the pressure from corporate and the demand of the customers. Make your mind up about how your day is gonna be before you walk in"
good,I Was a very hard worker with CVS in covington on hwy 36 for approx 3 plus years and when trying and had asked to move up to a shift key holder I was never given an answer instead they(management) put a posting on the front door for the position! I was never given the opportunity and this made me think totally different about working with CVS! So CVS doesn’t value hard workers!
good,"CVS Health was a great company to work for...until you started to break things down.  Management has a tendency to not listen to employees when it comes to work/life balance, work load, and overall work stress.  The benefits were less than stellar coming from a health company.  The good is that they do prefer to promote from within the company."
good,"A typical day at work includes ringing out customers and assisting the shift supervisor on duty. After several months you generally learn how to spot a shoplifter, how to spot a scam and how to deal with most of the public."
good,"Solid corporate structure. Was able to relocate across the country twice with a job awaiting me. Advancement can stagnate, especially if your direct supervisor wants to block it, which happens."
good,"A typical day is to work in production, filling prescription, waiting on customers , putting prescription in, daily counts of medication, checking out customers."
good,"Great company and benefits. However the work environment is a bit too chaotic. Supervision is too a minimum, which is great but not right out of training. Too much office gossip and personal issues brought to work!!!"
good,"Friendly atmosphere, nice people, fast pace work hours were to die for. Pay was on time and insurance was great will work again once retired from current career"
good,"Company website provides training modules for"
good,"Take care of cashier service includes checking out customers,honour coupons, help to find product."
good,"It was okay working at CVS. The job was easy and enjoyable. Management made it rough though. If you ever requested off a day or did something out of what they consider is the best, you got points dicked. Which is fine if you're just being silly or just laying out. If you have a real reason to not work, they had a problem then too. They care more about the job than the people which is annoying. I like for my jobs to be more personable."
good,Any typical day can be one monotony or a day of variability. The workplace culture like many corporate businesses is very diverse and promotes diversity.
good,"Helping offices and patients was very rewarding. A typical day is spent calling on assigned offices, clinics and hospitals to help the offices get complex specialty medications covered for their patients."
good,I really enjoyed working there.  Wanted to retire there.  The company downsized and let three hundred (300) managers go in the same week.  I was one of them.  My responsibilities were of a fast pace and it was exciting to complete the contract for future business opportunities.
good,"Follow tasks, complete tasks and ask all questions that you feel you don't understand.Talk in groups with your co-workers to get a better view on the tasks at hand. Grouping together we call it H.u.d.d.l.e so all questions asked everyone hears and also come to a head. Everyone knows exactly what's expected at the same time."
good,"This is a company for people who at in school, you would love to work for them if you are a friendly person who loves too smile and know how to handle customers"
good,Working with a good team is important. We have a very diverse set of personalities within the different workers in the pharmacy-from the techs to the pharmacists to the front-store workers. I try my best to keep a steady workflow at all times. We work in a very fast-paced pharmacy-being right next door to Huntsville Hospital and staying open until midnight. My goal at work is to make my customers smile and always remain patient and kind with each person I encounter. It truly has been a great job in that I have realized my leadership potential.
good,CVS is a great company to work for. Working in a pharmacy is an interesting job. It's just very fast paced and a lot of hours on your feet. The training is thorough but the hours are all over the place.
good,"If they paid fairly, it would be a great job, but they don't."
good,A typical day was starting off at whatever station u were assigned to. In about an hour or so u would be switched to another one. I loved production filling all the prescriptions.
good,"data  entree, phone calls, answering questions from supervisors and looking up files, doing disciplines, attendance for over 400 workers daily, nice office environment, there was on some days not enough time in the day to finished but always managed to finish on time."
good,Wasn't a very good place but was not terrible. Friendly associates and some decent management. Laid back environment and job duties were not very demanding.
good,It was great but there was an unhealthy life-work balance. Compensation wasn't as much as I thought it would be. They only gave 7 minutes of personal time a day. They also had strenuous policies.
good,Overall A great place for a part time job. Can get stressful and not enough pay for the amount of work needed to be done. Patient interactions are usually pleasant.
good,"Being a pharmacy technician at CVS was a great job when I first started. However, the lack for advancement and low pay for the work you do can’t be ignored. It is a great opportunity for an individual looking to get into the medical field because you learn about medications and how they work."
good,Retail pharmacy is challenging.  Working with the public is never easy all the time.  Flexible schedules for part-time employees makes it worthwhile while going to school.
good,I loved what I did but i hated the environment that i had to be in. It was very stressful and some of the co-workers could be very rude. I ended up having to leave that job because of my relocation
good,Unfair low pay alot drama no one to work with your scheduele everyone knows your personal business.  No open door policy. No real advancement pay can be alot better
good,it was okay but my department was laid off. I don't think that I would apply again. I had to work as a temp for a year before I was hired. Then they paid some people more after they laid everyone off. This was not cool
good,"Check data submissions for the customers, and make sure their contact information is correct. Also, help review letters for customers medication in a timely manner."
good,"A typical day at CVS is fast-paced, high energy, stressful, and emotionally draining. However, our team is close-knit and willing to work together for the betterment of the team, our customers, and our company."
good,"Great temporary job. Very relaxed and nice employees. No benefits, no sick leaves and no paid vacations. The hours are great and the manager really did her best to satisfy our schedules and gave me lot of hours"
good,Pharmacy works hard to maintain customer base in a field that is constantly changing.  Culture is diverse.  I worked as a supervisor. The most challenging part was work life balance. Time management was also  challenge as managers are also drawn into additional projects
good,"working and CVS was good for the most part. hours were not good, if it was slow you would be asked to leave. a lot of the work positions were not shared by all employees."
good,"Productive laid back environment, opportunity depending which branch you at. Easy to let go. Training needs more attention and management. Needs more growth within management"
good,"I love my job, but the pay is poor. Love helping people. The company needs to make some changes. They lack in the hours needed to run their pharmacy right."
good,"ok place to work,"
good,"Would rather not commnet at this time."
good,For a company like this i would use as a stepping stone for something much larger in the future if you want to grow. Its very recommendable for someone who is a high school graduate or in high school or is looking for extra experience if your going to pharmacy school or medical school. This is not a job that you can have when you have a family to take care of.
good,if you want to sit down and do the same thing for 8 hours a day 5 days a week. this may be for you. and for some it is a great easy job to get paid. i however do not feel accomplished by never being able to learn more or having the ability to advance in my career.
good,Depending on the day and season work could be relaxing and enjoyable to stressful and hectic. I prefer the hectic days over the relaxing days because there is always something that needs to be done. When I work I like learning new things from day to day. I have mostly enjoyed working at CVS. My coworkers are the best part of my experience and helping people. The compensation and raises are a downer.
good,Coram Health Care is a friendly place to work at. Ive been with them for many years now delivering medical supplies to patients in the home care system
good,"Upper management seems to be out of touch with actual pharmacy experience.  We are expected to do more work than can be performed with the allowed staffing.  Unpaid extra hours are not acknowledged or appreciated, yet seem expected if you are ""salaried"".  All upper management is different, but there is high turn-over if the district management is too kind."
good,"I've worked for CVS Health since 2008 on the PBM side.  The company itself is decent and they try to promote an overall inclusive culture.  However, dependent on your position in the company, the work life balance leaves much to be desired."
good,"The most difficult part of my job was that my schedule was different everyday.  There was never a set schedule, which made it hard to have a work/life balance."
good,I worked salary position for 80 hours weekly and got paid for 44 hours for over 20 years. Upper management was not helpful and was not supportive.
good,"I did good if u ask me. But the boss was really rude sometimes when I came in to work he wouldn't even say a word to me , and he wasn't the type that you could come to if you needed help , so I had to pretty much figure it out"
good,"Supervised and trained staff and monitored staff performance"
good,Good place for anyone looking to pursue a pharmacy career. You learn a lot about the medication from just working there for a few weeks.
good,"I had a great Supervisor and District Manager but when you're no longer happy with your job because you have not gotten a pay raise, then it's time to go look for another place to work at. But overall, I loved working there, the Pharmacists and the other staff are very nice and accommodating according to your needs."
good,"My job as a Nationally Certified Technician is rewarding personally because I help people in need and comfort those who are in pain. I have learned that I am capable of much more but I am unable to advance in this position. I would love to be able to work for a company who notices there are some employees who go above and beyond daily for the company they work for, who sacrifice time with family and who are always on time and never call out.  My peers are great but we are not allowed to mingle during the course of a day due to the high volume that is required."
good,My day typically starts at 7am. I have learned to work even better with people and more about labour laws than i did when i came on board. The management need to improve on their communication skills. The co-workers also need to be more friendly. Implementing a good attendance rate amongst pharmacists is the hardest part. When pharmacies across the region fulfill great serve to our patients.
good,I enjoy my job at CVS. Usually I am stocking the shelves and unloading truck if there is one. If im not on the floor I am behind the counter checking the customers our and helping our customers with anything that I am capable. I enjoy everyone I work with. My only complaint is the hours they need me to work. Its nothing they can help I just need a full time day job because I have a newborn son.
good,Focusing in customers service is the number one priority. Stocking of shelves is a daily routine. Maintaining a neat and organize store.
good,The job was okay itself because I am very passionate about what I do but I couldn't adapt to the over nights. I didn't really get to meet to many people due to my short time with the company.
good,"As a company, CVS is protective, helpful, and generous, though they don't seem to understand workflow at retail level.  They drill the importance of metrics into the supervisors to the point that the patient is forgotten.  And because the budget hours do not allow for more technicians, trying to accomplish the list of metrics as wells as taking care of the patient becomes incredibly difficult."
good,"Working is a pharmacy is challenging sometime because we are dealing with customers, co-workers, and management. As a pharmacy tech, I had learned that the customers always come first it doesn't matter how crazy the pharmacy is, be sure to help the customers first. Pharmacy is always go go go and go, meaning that you all always be moving around from station to another. This makes the time/day go by faster. I would tell anyone to apply for CVS Pharmacy because they teach you, go grown with the company, and you are apart of a team. Also, it is a good company to work for."
good,"Worked with a great team. Driven atmosphere with expectations of sound work. Main driver was quality products and services at a fair price. "
good,I have no positive response other than my receiving my License as a Pharmacy Technician. It was a great experience for me to learn something different
good,Me gusta todo de mi trabajo  la mas dura es porque nunca tuve vacaciones y no me dieron permiso por la muerte de mis padres es la mas dura  me gusta trabajar en equipo buen comunicador
good,"The position was very stressful due to customer demand, but the people I worked with were awesome. CVS made sure to provide adequate training as well."
good,"Relaxed work environment. Company is currently experiencing restructuring that has management more focused on quantity rather than the quality of work. Working for this company I've learned that I'm very adaptable, there is a different focus almost daily."
good,"Engage in marketing, sales and patient education and instruction on infusion services for a leader in the home infusion industry. Develop and execute strategic sales plans. Collaborate with Sales partners to target key customers to improve market share and bottom line revenue. Instruct patients on all aspects and components of Infusion therapies. Communicate benefit coverage to patients and caregivers. Work with Branch Operations Teams to facilitate seamless patient discharge and positive patient experiences. Develop and service business relationships with internal/external customers and manufacturing partners. Represent the company at vendor and community events."
good,"Great start up job, but after a while, corporate and DM and SM start to overwork you and they will not compensate you according to your abilities. $1 raises for everyone. Company will be great if they really start caring about the employees a lot more."
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,"CVS is a awesome place to work, if you have an open schedule. I love what I do but they just cut hours for everyone and there's just not enough to go around.  My boss is awesome and every other store manager i have met working there is also awesome. Everyone has a great personality!"
good,"Around 10 years of my career with CVS. Got the chance to explore different skills as a Developer, Lead, Analyst, Management and project ownership."
good,Working here i have learned that you cant let things people say get to you
good,Great customer service skills developed and working in fast pace environment with great team members.
good,"Typical day is customer service, handling cash, drive thru, organization and filling prescriptions. I learned how to complete different transactions like debit and credit cards, checks as well. Management was great a loving environment. Easiest part was helping people get there medications and making It a smooth transaction."
good,"Good Experience learning how to fill patent prescriptions in a timely manner. Good environment with friendly co-workers."
good,Love the people I work with on a day to day basis. Not including the actual store manager.
good,A typical day at work is a very fast-paced learning environment. Management is very strict and coworkers are friendly. The hardest part about the job is sometimes having to do more than one job at a time. the most enjoyable part of the job is providing great customer service.
good,"A typical day was anything but typical. Dealing with valued customers gives one a wide variety of attitude, and problems to deal with. Not all are bad, actually around 10% were the ones that caused problems. My co-workers were very helpful, and friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the customers, and the hardest part was when a mother didn't have enough money to pay for things her child needed. I learned to be humble, and thankful for what I have. Even though it's not a lot, it more than others."
good,The pay is reasonable and love my co-workers. No work Saturday and Sunday.
good,was there for the experience and the basics of loss prevention
good,work could e very easy but thy don't schedule enough staff to work shift
good,A typical day at work is to work your but off.You have to pick a certain amount of product in an hour.I learned to work fast.The hardest part was the physical labor.The enjoyable part was getting off at 1 pm.
good,"A typical day at CVS pretty much varies on where you are in the store. If your on the register your dealing with customers. If you out in the store you either fixing the shelves, helping the customers find items, watching out for thieves, and  hanging or removing add in the store. The co-workers i have are helpful and as a team we get our job done quickly. The managers I've worked for a great managers, they are great listeners too. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers but if you have patience it can be handled with ease."
good,"Over all this company is an growing company and also downsize every so often. Been at this company since 2011 and has learn about customer care service, a lot of different systems and great communications over the telephone"
good,"Great Place to work and the team works well together"
good,They dont value hard workers like other companies would. I worked for 7 days in a row because managment said they needed my help on my days off and on the 7th day i was called into a meeting where they informed me that do to the loss of buisness my position had been eliminated.
good,"Stand. Fill prescriptions. Deal with angry customers. Management is okay but pushes us into ""bugging"" patients to make sales, e.g. calling them every day to refill prescriptions, forces us to sign them up for extra care cards. The most enjoyable part is just the few customers who really appreciate what you do and the efforts you make. The worst part is the pay is really low compared to other technician jobs. "
good,"Working at CVS Pharmacy for the past almost 4 years has taught me many things, and has introduced me to some amazing people. A typical day at work consisted of organize and filing the morning paper work, preparing prescriptions to be verified by the pharmacist, any customer service tasks that came up through out the day were my responsibility such as interaction with insurance companies, and cash register sales. Through out the day, prescriptions would come in and the medication would not be in task, as a pharmacy technician it was my responsibility to place the order to ensure the customer would get their medication the next day. After working there for 2 and half years, the task of producing the weekly schedule for employees of the pharmacy was my responsibility. Working with pharmacists one on one, was a great experience and I learned a lot from them. The most enjoyable part of my job at CVS was the satisfaction of helping other people. "
good,Great job...pay not great and management not held accountable.
good,This work site was pretty interesting because I learned while gaining experience at CVS.    
good,"Worked in Customer Service, Billing, Accounts Receibable, as a team player. The days were busy alot of multitasking."
good,A typical day at work was either on a plane or on conference calls all day then working throughout the evening and weekends. I learned that the more you know the more you get to work. I have worked with some of the best co-workers ever!! The people really help you through the day! Most enjoyable parts were helping employees achieve their goals and providing great service to clients. The hardest part of the job was trying to make these things happen with tightly managed expenses.
good,"A typical day at work is usually busy and stressful. The hours have been cut and we don't have enough help here lately. When the hours are reasonable we have a good, productive day. I learn more about the different drugs everyday. I have good co-workers and we try and have fun to help the day go by and be a little less stressful. I job can be difficult when you have a lot of problems, like with billing insurance and the doctors not calling in prescriptions. Overall it is a enjoyable job and I like what I do. It is always nice when you can help someone with the medication and they really appreciate what you do for them."
good,My experience with CVS has been very pleasant due to my great co workers and supervisor. The job itself was very detailed and required a significant amount of multi tasking which at times could be a little stressful but also very rewarding.
good,"CVS was a great place to work , I was only there on assignment. I wish I had gone through CVS to get hired , I heard there benefits were good. But everyone there was real helpful when it came to needing direction or help. Management was always close by and we're great listeners as well . I would recommend this company to anyone ."
good,CVS helped solidify my customer service skills. High stress but great experience.
good,I have been working at CVS/Caremark for seven years and have learned a lot about the pharmacy and PBM side of the market. I have enjoyed my time in the Specialty Pharmacy because I appreciated taking the time to help patients better their health by ensuring they received their medications on time. I also enjoyed my time training new employees and see their further education develop within the company. I have taken on challenging roles in the company as well by working in the Client Benefits department. We had many deadlines to meet and ensure the quality of our work was completed and corrected by one hundred percent.
good,"A great work atmosphere for a college student to make money on the side with flexible scheduling. A typical day at work consists of data entry of prescriptions, presciption filling, insurance billing, doctor contact, and customer service. I have learned the importance of being a responsible and competent worker and how important that is when working in a team environment. My managers in the pharmacy have always been polite and I have developed professional and personal relationships with them as well my co-workers, some of whom I have requested for positions in the pharmacy. The hardest part of the job is being patient with the customers, especially the elderly ones but it is learned over time and everyone develops a method that suites them best. The most enjoyable part of my job is completing a task as a team with co-workers who have become more like friends than co-workers and solving difficult insurance and prescription issues for polite customers."
good,enjoyed being at work and working with great people. Enjoy doing customer service and assisting with finding items.
good,"a typical day would be come to work turn on all the machine in the photo lab set the lab up for the day while taking care of customers at front desk . What i learned in management is that everyone does not work the same and everyone is seeking and looking for different things in a job. my co-worker was younger and not very flexible about there week end schedule . The hardest part of the job was getting promoted , i had a great store manger that would not allow you to quit but to push for perfection as she did . T he most enjoyable part of the job was learning a new trade and getting a chance to learn and train as a pharmacy tech"
good,its a good place to work just lack of communication in the office
good,"position during senior year: responsibilities consist of stocking merchandise and refrigerated foods, provided coverage for other positions, assist customers, answer phones, cashiering duties for open and closing of shift, balancing drawers, stocking in any sequence, multi-tasking to assist in all areas as per needs of the company."
good,A typical day at work is to provide over the phone support to field technicians or CVS personnel. We deal with every and all equipment issues throughout CVS pharmacy equipment. I work with a great team of co-workers. The most enjoyabble part of my job is helping store personnel be able to resume their daily task after resolving their IT related problems.
good,"I loved my job at cvs, loved who I worked with, but it was not flexible enough for me I asked for two days off was they were unable to to that for me."
good,"Most rewarding at the end of the day is knowing you helped customer's with their question's to products, prices and just putting a smile on someone's face."
good,Must have high level of concentration when packaging orders. But the work is not hard but it is important to pack ice meds products right. The benefits are just ok.
good,"I really loved working at CVS/ Pharmacy, but I think they treat their employees and their pharmacists wrong when it comes to listening to what they have to say. I always had a fun time with the people I was scheduled to work with. I never thought I would learn so many things. Working at CVS was my first real challenging job, I didn't think I was going to learn how to input data, insurance, become inventory specialist, etc. I didn't think anyone would believe in me the way my manager ended up believing in me. The hardest part of the job for me was working afternoon shifts, and trying to make up the schedule. I loved the customers, old people are always smiling and it made me smile. Overall, I loved that job, and if I could go back, I would definitely do things differently."
good,The longer you stay at they company the more you learn and understand their way of working everything. I know I still learning and I like working for this company.
good,If you are not a full time do not expect many hours. Depends which location you work on for flexibility. CVS NEVER closes so stay on the look out for that includes Christmas.
good,"I was able to develop a lot of the team members so that they could improve in their skills relating to their positions.  However, the pharmacy manager never took accountability and never had any leadership skills.  A lot of my thoughts and concerns were dismissed.  The pharmacy would have been an amazing work environment if our pharmacy manager showed an ounce of passion towards her work."
good,"I worked here for 2.5 years and enjoyed about 2 years of it. Management changes and growing tension between employees made the final months pretty rough but I left on a good note. But overall, this was a good job."
good,good place to work  at helping the people out good customer service good attitude towards the customer  love helping the people out alwyas be respectful be postive
good,There are many stores so there is no shortage of options. The hours from week to week are flexible as well. Customers can be challenging to deal with but that's retail.
good,Short training period followed by two weeks of side by side training with tenured employees. Must follow time period of call adherence regardless of nature of call.
good,It was fun and knowledgeable working with CVS but not all locations are same.I worked several locations and I have different experiences overall.Pay is little low based on the responsibilities.
good,"On a daily basis at CVS, I would come into work and stock shelves, help customers, and clean. Managers were demanding but that made for a clean, and stable store that gets a decent amount of business each day. Seeing the customers faces when they received great customer service, and my charming and pleasant attitude would always make my day. But when I would receive attitude  by customers it did not make the day go too well"
good,"it all depends on who you work with, the day you work, and the predicament of the situation on how you're job will be. the customers vary, but majority are rude and unappreciative and treat the employees poorly. and good luck calling out without a doctor's note. i did this ONCE and was treated poorly and guilt tripped by one of the pharmacists."
good,Watch how the coworkers talk to each other. Watch how the store is run before you apply to certain stores. Sometimes you will be stuck by yourself for long periods of time sometimes you're not. You're gonna have to be able to stick it up to stubborn customers. Other than that this job is nice.
good,I was apart of the launch of the revenue cycle here in Phoenix. The Director was a super amazing Women her excellence in customer and employee engagement was phenomenal.
good,"Pays some money doesn’t pay a living wage that’s for sure! There are some amazing people who work there and same with the customers.. "
good,in the almost 16 years with CVS has been rewarding but not enough hours given to stores to be affective to grow and take care of the duties given and if you are a manager you have to work over the hours you are paid
good,"Satisfying the customer comes before everything. All work we do is customer focused. Must able to work in a fast paced environment, while having great customer service."
good,"As an employee at CVS i was constantly working hard and always had a busy day. There are always more tasks to find even after completing your daily list. I have learned customer service skills as well as management skills. Though, upper management never took problems seriously and most times it has caused employees to leave the company. The hardest part of the job is supervising other employees. As a young supervisor myself, i found it very hard to have my co-workers that were with the company longer listen to me when giving direction, or advice. The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with the customers."
good,"Poorly managed, new hires are constantly lied to about what they are to receive, hours fluctuate greatly depending on how many pharmacists are hired. The pay is good but you get 55 hours one week at 20 the next. You're always in trouble for something and yet management is never available to help."
good,"When dealing with customers you have to have patience because you never know what type of day the person might be having, also management kind of sucks but if you just do your job you’ll be fine."
good,"A typical day at the CVS I work at is rather busy. I think the workload and work culture, or environment, is dependent upon the location of your store. The area in which my store is located is rather saturated with non-English speakers so most of my shift is spent translating for the pharmacists who don't speak Spanish. This language barrier easily causes a decrease in workflow due to others making sure the issue at hand as been solved. Overall, the management is great, and I think everyone I work with has a good relationship with one another."
good,"CVS Health is a great environment, but many stores got cut down on hours and it’s not as great as it use to. It is a fast pace environment depending on the location your store is at. My store is super busy, especially on the first of the month."
good,"this is one of the best places to work in retail, the customers are nice, the coupons are easy to fix if they are wrong, no one ever gets mad. If you fall behind in a lot of work it can get a little stressful but as long as you manage your time and continue putting effort into your work, you'll have a good time."
good,"Decent place to work for those wanting to start a career in prescription benefit management. Very fast paced environment. There never seems to be enough hours in the day to complete everything.  So, you will work very long hours. The management staff are very helpful and knowledgeable. You will constantly learn something new every day. The hardest part about the job is the lack of communication between internal partners. One hand never knows what the other is doing, thus causing confusion and division. This job isn't for the faint or the weak by no means.  You must have tough skin and willing to take the punches each day from demanding clients."
good,"I have worked for CVS in a management capacity for four years, and I was hired on initially as a Store Manager Trainee.  The intent was to train me up to run a store relatively independently.  While I was in this role, the company changed its management structure, thereby eliminating many of the positions for which I was being developed.  While I was still able to operate as an Operations Manager in a store, the company preferred to recruit salaried management from outside their ranks.  After training five different store managers, I have determined that it is in my best interest and in accordance with my goals that I look for advancement elsewhere."
good,"I learned a lot working there CVS is a great company to work for, Family oriented, paid training, & great work environment, Overtime."
good,"Most pharmacist, interns, and technicians are overworked. My store was always short staffed and even as a full time student I was expected to work over 30 hours per weeks"
good,"CVS allowed me the opportunity to work independently and to expand the practice.  For instance, the over use of antibiotics was a major issue at this location.  I educated patients on the appropriate use of antibiotics and provided them with material to read  at a later time (which supported what I told them)."
good,If you go to this job all you have to do is work and deal with people who can't communicate well that's it. Picking and packing is a simple and extremely easy process. Just if you can handle the stress the pay more than makes up for it.
good,"You have to build the trust of your customers in your ability to take care of them. Treat everyone with respect & you will receive it back tenfold. Very high energy, fast paced place with lots of hiccups dealing with insurance."
good,Everyday is different and demand different hours.  Mandatory OT is required of salaried workers.  HR is pro-management and will allow supervisors to find issues to term employees unfairly.
good,"Depending on who is working makes or breaks the work day. There are certain people who do not know what they are doing or move slow, and that is unacceptable when we get busy."
good,"Enjoyed my various positions at CVS, but it was high-stress and competitive. Annual lay-offs every November instilled fear over job security. Heavily layered management resulted in some directors having a single direct report. Very class-oriented team structure."
good,i learned a lot from cvs as a pharmacy Technician. But i didn't liked that when i started i changed me to 2 locations and working different locations as cvs company cut down hours and they doesn't pay well for coworkers.
good,"If you like high-stress and quick-paced work that keeps your mind constantly engaged, and enjoy being on your feet, CVS pharmacy is a great place to work.  The insurance, patient, and scheduling problems require you to constantly be thinking about solutions that will benefit your customers and allow them to live healthy lives while saving money.  Experiencing this intensity within your small colleague group will result in strong bonds and lifelong friendships."
good,"si le caes bien al jefe te promueven,lo que no este caso."
good,"I was volunteered for the delivery driver position, which allowed me to come into contact with patients on a more personal level.  Seeing these patients in their home environment allowed me to deliver more compassion and empathy to their situations and identify with in-store customers on a higher level as well. "
good,"mostly busy at work, evryday new stuff to learn, management is just ok, no comments for workplace culture, all day work on phone. working together in team."
good,I cant say my experiences for the most part working at CVS were either good or bad. Just seemed like a very regular job with pretty predictable manual labor. Management could be more involved with the employees though.
good,Very fast paced environment must be able to work well under pressure and effectively multitask. Customer service and patience are necessary for sucess
good,"-management was cool"
good,"CVS  combines long term care pharmacy services, on-site medication dispensing and certified geriatric clinical pharmacists to deliver innovative pharmacy services nationwide. We listened to patients, nurses, physicians and pharmacists to identify the major pain points with their current approach to medication management. As a result of this collaboration, we placed our focus on increasing safety, improving access to medications and clinical pharmacists, and maximizing time and cost savings. CVS can help your facility improve outcomes and reduce costs. The impact on patient care and your bottom line is both meaningful and measurable. Compare for yourself."
good,Hours are not flexible and it makes it difficult to balance work and home life with kids because of that. Multitasking can get overwhelming at times. Paid baby bonding time. Very caring company. Easy to learn the job and company values.
good,"Working in the pharmacy not only teaches you about medications and part of the medical field, but also teaches you great time management skills that you use in every day life"
good,I was a contractor working to get hired as FTE. My one year contract come up and they wanted to keep me as a contractor. Great manager and co workers! I would work there again.
good,"Helping customers with the needs to obtain their medication.  When each customer comes to you with their prescription they are looking towards us to make sure they get what they need in a timely manner but most of all it is correct,"
good,"If you are one who is good one the phone lines, then this job is for you. I personally have been here 4 years, and its is time for a change. CVS is a great company, however being here so long, you learn the ins and outs of the management and tasks."
good,I worked at CVS about 10 years ago and am sure many things have changed since my time there. It was a good place to start my career in the medical field and I enjoyed being able to help people.
good,The working day was fast paced and always had work to do. sometimes it was hard to move up once you got to a certain position. mostly flexible with your schedule.
good,"Job duties: Assist the pharmacy in the preparation of prescriptions. Maintain good customer service by accepting prescriptions or refill requests, processing sales and compounding prescriptions. Achieve customer satisfaction by promptly processing prescriptions, sales transactions, and answering questions, stocking, pricing over the counter (OTC) items, inventory management, and operating the cash register."
good,"Whenever I come in for work, they would aways make me and some student workers put away stuff back from the shelves. I learned how to read barcodes and directed where to place the items back in their proper shelves."
good,"My experience at CVS Pharmacy as a pharmacy technician was different than working as a technician at Shawn Pharmacy. A typical day at work was working at the register, assisting customers inside and outside the pharmacy area, and helping fellow employees complete different tasks around the pharmacy. The hardest part of the job was not being able to work at more than one part of the pharmacy. I was not able to develop new skills and working abilities. However, I did manage to learn more about organization and communicational skills. Seeing new faces coming into the store the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I've worked for them twice-once as AdvancePCS in a permanent position that I loved and again later as a contractor when they became CVSHealth.  They are a good place for learning new things and the team I was part of was very bright, committed, and caring.  However, not much work life balance once you go on staff permanently. As a contractor it worked well - paid well and gleaned a lot of experience but needed a full-time position with benefits again."
good,"Temp to hire position, temp could last 18-24 months before FT hire, often people are let go after working over a year, 50 calls a day, plus online chats."
good,"The pharmacy is a great place to work, they offer training and assist with certifications. Most managers are kind and understanding. The day to day task were always clear which helps with accountablity issues and ensure the most effective work flow."
good,This job was temporary for me. I knew the manager that I was working under from outside of work. I got more hours than I needed and the girls I worked with were great!
good,"The experience and education from the job is great!! You learn about medicines and how they work (to a point and depending on who the Pharmacist is) as well as working with some awesome co-workers. My only negative about this, and any other pharmacy, is that Pharmacy techs are very underpaid for the work they do. They are dealing with prescription drugs, handling calls and dealing with customer facing customer service/ retail."
good,"This is a fairly new store, nice an clean."
good,Customers could get very rude at times but the ones that are nice will really make your day. Customers would stand and talk to you while they wait on their love one in the store. There’s other that would get disrespectful over a coupon that doesn’t apply to the items they shopped.
good,"great place to work, 2 sided on management, not fair with employee misconduct, need better raises for employees, offer benefits for free points to buy merchandise but is not used. Lot of heavy lifting when unloading truck with alcohol. Totes are heavy. Helping customers to find what they want or need is a blessing."
good,"Most pharmacies are fast paced. You are busy from beginning to the end of your shift. If you like the fast paced environment, this is a great career choice. I love working with the public and enjoy customer interaction."
good,Not paid well for the work we do. Not much difference in pay between the cashier and certified pharmacy techhnician (who need a vast knowledge and stess).
good,it's only you so you csn run the clinic how you want.  You taker care of the patients immediately on th spot.  You learn how to manage your day and how to manage your  day.  You come in and open thr clinic.  you see patietn until it;s lunch time.  You take your break then go back to seeing patients until your days is done.
good,"CVS is a fast pace work environment. keeps you very busy with filling  prescription, calling doctors offices and or insurances. CVS is always short staffed so I not only do my job but others jobs as well."
good,"let go due to down sizing"
good,"This job prepared me to handle pressure in a fast paced environment. A typical day consists of receiving 50-70 calls a day assisting customers with everything from, routine medication refills to Lost in Transit escalated calls."
good,It's a good place to work and has great pay. They are willing to train you even if you only have a tech in training license. The hardest part of the job sometimes would be the customers. Also that you are timed for everything that you do.
good,Diversified work culture but the hours were terrible. Little or no career paths available. Job schedule was weekends only. It is an OK job for a college student.
good,"Cvs overall was a fun and competitive atmosphere, the only problem was as soon as the management changed with the Pharmacists my hours were cut and they were not able to work with my schedule like the last Pharmacist has done. They are an excellent company to work for just need to be a little more reasonable., especially with people that show they want to work."
good,"Assisted lead pharmacist  in production area by taking phone calls, counting pills, labeling prescriptions, greeting patients.  Assisted customer with locating merchandise."
good,Some people have positions they are not qualified for. Hired as a pharm tech but have to work on the phones which is not part of the original job description.
good,"Learned skills with computers, and scan guns, technical equipment, plenty of chances to be rewarded for doing a great job.  Management was decent, and do their best to work with you in tough circumstances."
good,It is a very busy store.  The in store training could have been better.  Management is fluid because it is so busy.  The culture depends on the pharmacist you are working with.  The hardest part of the job is who you are working for and the insurance issues.  The most enjoyable part is helping the patients.
good,"Cvs is a great place to work if you do not have a family. The starting pay sucks; the yearly raise sucks and so does the benefits. The management well the RPH I worked with was very helpful and cool, like family"
good,I have a great team of coworkers that are always willing to help when things get tough.  We all work really well together and have built strong working relationships.
good,"Work relationships were strong - good people.  Company direction for  development and facilities maintenance was weak... enterprise representation for the facilities was lacking and needed to be stronger. Company direction seemed to be focused on today and not long term."
good,"since i have worked in populated area it always a busy day, i have learned Spanish and how to be very calm and understanding to other's conditions. i have worked under two different mangers and it was an opportunity to learn more about leading. the hardest part of my job was dealing with insurance companies over the phone on a busy day. the most enjoyable part of my job the cook out festive that takes over every day."
good,"Customers are great, customer service experience is appreciated, sales experience is key. Please apply on CVS website on careers webpage. People call the store everyday and we dont have paper applications."
good,"If you do your job you will be fine. Lots of demands and not enough help to go around due to budget cuts. However, job security is key and at the end of the day you are getting paid to work so you might as well deal with it"
good,"CVS Is a Fortune 500 Company, I think they are number 7 on the list. For such a successful company the benefits are not passed down to the employees. They are always running on too few employees, and I am always doing at least 3 different things as well as striving to provide excellent customer service because we are reviewed every month on our marks. Some techs have additional duties but are still expected to ring the register or process prescriptions at drop off. It is a very fast-paced environment, stressful and high energy. There are no time for breaks, and you don't accrue paid time off until you have been there for a year."
good,This job was actually an unpaid internship i had to complete for a school program. I learned how to out the pills away / where they went. Pulling expired drugs and returning prescriptions to stock.
good,"This job best suits someone in school only looking to work 16-20 hours weekly full flex days and nights. If your willing to work 20 front end and 20 pharmacy or be promoted to shift lead you will get full time if not you might get 30 hours at best! They will work around your schedule, however the pay rate is not so great. Your customers, associates and management are easy going and pleasant which is a plus but if your in it for the money or the hours not for you!"
good,I truly loved this job. The downfall was the economy at the time which eliminated the particular job I was in. Since then they have completely left the photo processing business in most places and I truly believe that the business that made a ton of money could have been saved if they had not eliminated the District Category Specialists.
good,Some of the best people in our work force work in Pharmacies around the country.  I learned a lot about patience and compassion dealing with customers that don't always feel the greatest while we are asking questions about insurance and copays.  The work can be very fast paced and challenging.  Overall all the industry doesn't pay very well.
good,"There is a lot on your plate at CVS. It can be trying, but work with a sense of urgency, learn as much as you can in all parts of the business, show that you care. and you can be happy there."
good,"A typical day at CVS differs depending on the season. As for management, sometimes they could be helpful while other times they drag their feet with getting certain things done."
good,Pharmacy Technicians are very underpaid. Minimum wage is not a fair wage for this position. Management has not yet made this change and that is why they're losing workers.
good,"Cvs is all about the customers and co workers."
good,"Management needed to be more proactive for the the busy season. Little work life balance. All work no life.They provide all salaried workers with laptops so you can work 40-hours at work and then another 4, or more, hours at home. Plan on 60-80 hours a week when you work as a grievance consultant. Loved the job, but there was no life with this job."
good,I worked at different stations throughout the day.  Learned a lot about procedures and medications and what they are for.   Enjoyed serving the public and getting to know them.
good,"CVS is a great company to work for. I had a very bad experience with my prior supervisor. Rude, arrogant, and unprofessional. Never seen a worse example of what a pharmacist should be."
good,The Company provides get service to their patients and cares about them all. But is under staffed at times leaving others to work longer hours without compensation staff is expected to Flex their time so they don't get overtime for the extra hours worked. The job itself is fun and challenging however there is no room for advancement.
good,"I'm not going to deny that I loved working at CVS because I did. Tackling new challenges that force a logical way of thinking is what I love to do. Answering questions, solving problems, training new technicians to work hard but effectively whilst maintaining a strong passion for what the job entails is what I live for. But there comes a point where you realize that the ones you report to don't care about that. They care about the numbers and what you can do for them so they can look good to their superiors. I can't work for a company that leaves good hard working people at the bottom of the corporate chain in order to benefit themselves. It's sick seeing it firsthand. Everyone deserves a chance to do great things and to be a great leader but you're forced to work with very little and no room to succeed unless you fit into the glove that they've made for you, and even then there's little chance it'll work in your favor. If flying under the radar and getting pushed around is what you're interested in, by all means go for it. But if you have a yearning for more than that, I suggest only pursuing this job for experience reasons only. Just to be clear I'm not a bad, disgruntled employee who got screwed over. I'm not writing this because my feelings were hurt. This is just the truth when it comes to working for a company like CVS. Under my supervision the Inventory scores for my store were 100% every month because of the hard work I put in. At one point the store even ranked #1 in the nation. That's out of almost 9,000 stores. Put everything you have into this company and I promise"
good,"There is always something to do, you start with the register, then you move on to production and drop-off. I have learn how to multitask and be patient. Also how to focus on one task and move on to the next task step-by-step. A very diverse population of co-workers and patients. The hardest part of the job is staying focus and moving at a very fast pace at all time. The most enjoyable part of the job is having great co-workers that have your back, so team work!"
good,"Overall CVS/Omnicare gave me a legitimate opportunity to begin a professional career. During my time I was able to develop skills such as math, computer and customer relations."
good,Omnicare is a pretty good company to work with the only downfall being compensation. The company is not willing to pay employers what they deserve  for their hard work dedication and long hours.
good,Company with good intentions. Good pay if you stay for awhile. Good cheap insurance. Hour are typical of retail. If you've been there awhile you will get the good hours. A lot of good fun people to work with.
good,it was a part time job. i learned a lot on the job about pharmaceuticals. It was on the job training. I was the only one who was not familiar at all with anything pharmacy related but the pharmacist was very patient.
good,"Everyone there is nice, Management is not always friendly and will make you feel uncomfortable working there. Busy enviroment and they will not give you a big raise"
good,You have to like getting yelled at by customers and have patience to deal with insurance claims..................................... and the pay is low for all the work you have to do.
good,Staff was helpful and fun. Anytime I needed assistance they were there to provide it. everyone had great attitudes as if they wanted to be there. The work environment was awesome.
good,"Work/life balance is difficult working for this company, expected to work over job description hours especially at salary level. Opportunities to further career in corporate is a plus."
good,"I was hired at training pay 2 years ago. I completed my training and was never given a raise. I spend much of my life at work, making it hard to raise 3 beautiful children. My Pharmacist in Charge is wonderful and tries to help all of my coworkers when he can. Its still hard to maintain a balance with constantly fluctuating schedules and no way to advance."
good,"I enjoyed my work at CVS Pharmacy. However, the works hours were not flexible enough to meet my lifestyle requirements despite me working at a 24 hour location."
good,This is a good company to work for. The staff is very friendly they are also very professional. The work area is very organized.
good,I would go from 8 hours one week to 30 hours the next. It is possible to maybe pick up more hours by offering to pick up shifts at different CVS' in the area.
good,Hard job to do when balancing a family. Hours are not kid friendly and it is hard to balance work and home in retail. Job requires a lot more manual labor than you would think!
good,"This fast-paced job is filled with multi-tasking, for all employee levels.  Stocking, out-date checks, customer service, all with minimum staffing, keep employees busy."
good,"It is a fast paced job that can have really long hours. It requires a lot of multitasking. However, the management is good."
good,"I have loved working at CVS pharmacy. I began working there while I was in college and it provided a sustainable income for your average college student. Now that I have graduated, I was looking to become full time so I would be able to receive vacation time and other insurance benefits. The CVS policy stated though, if you were hired as a part time employee, then in order to become full time you must work at least 30 hours per week for a FULL year before you can become eligible for full time benefits. This is the main reason I am looking to leave the company."
good,Enjoyed the fast pace and helping others.Very face paced and mult-tasked. Managers were the best as they allowed you time off when a family situation ocurred.
good,Dedicated to deliver quality work and meet strict deadlines. Work with a great group of people. The hardest part of the job is the long drive and extremely long hours. Hard to have work/life balance.
good,Somewhat stressful but love my co workers. There is too much red tape and not enough pharmacist help. CVS Heath's main focus is customer service but needs more concentration on technician training.
good,"It was a great experience, I enjoyed the job as well as the staff, however, it was a PRN position, so once the technician came back from maternity leave, I had to find other employment."
good,"Very flexible hours and good place to work."
good,"The company is good but the store I was in was horrible, no hours, managers changing every week, always getting robbed and mice everywhere in the stock room."
good,"You personally, do not matter to CVS Health.  They could care less is you are overworked, if you are suffering from anything.  It is a high stress job environment, and there are not enough employees at one time to do all the necessary work per shift."
good,"It is interesting to learn about several medications and interactions"
good,"•	Deliver results while balancing quality and efficiency in all tasks; maintain accuracy while consistently meeting work flow and inventory management goals."
good,Due to my condition of being pregnant it was very easy and I learned a lot. Very nice company to work for if you need something not so physical.
good,"If you can make it at CVS, you can make it anywhere. Most upper management is really nice and willing to help, but main focus is all about numbers rather than creating an enriching work environment. Customers here seem more demanding than most places, but that may have just been our area. Overall a good place to work. Compensation and benefits could be better."
good,"It's an easy job, but the atmosphere is draining. Management is horrible. The company gets way too ahead of themselves. The people that work around you are lazy and don't want to do their job."
good,"A typical day at work, dealing with customers and insurance on a daily basis. Good co-workers and friendly environment. I've learned how to deal with insurance billing and how to handle claims correctly."
good,"The usual shift was around 8 hours. I enjoyed the interaction with the customers, and coworkers. I learned alot from my pharmacist and coworker."
good,"A typical day at CVS can vary between extreme lows and extreme highs. My coworkers and I know what needs to get done and we all contribute to the team differently to get the job done. I enjoy working with all of them and we all have built relationships with one another because most of us have been there day to day for 3 years or more with one another. I'm constantly learning new things by my peers and my pharmacist, which have in different ways contribute to my maturity level. I would say that's the most enjoyable part of my job. The absolute hardest thing about my job is building relationships with our long time patients/customers and then hear that they are sick or have passed away."
good,A very quite place to work.  Most of the daily activity was spent on the phone or behind the computer working on daily medical billing.
good,"Challenging, working under constant criticism of a few, others worked well as a team in behalf of the customers and the core values set by CVS."
good,"A typical day consisted of providing good customer service to everyone who came in the store while also performing routine assignments such as price changes, cycle counts, restocking shelves, and putting away new items."
good,"Very fast paced, no time for errors, customers can be very rude and condescending, anytime worked over 6 hours you only get 30 min for break and no other breaks, the pharm manager is a push over, very nice and understanding."
good,"I am moving from Pittsburgh Pa back to the midwest. I am from Vincennes, Indiana but will be living with my daughter in Mt Carmel."
good,Daily responsibilities are very redundant can be overwhelming due to lack of staff.This job has taught me patience in all aspects of the word. I love my co- workers we treat and take care of each other like family. The hardest part is learning how to deal with different people. The most enjoyable part is learning how I impact others.
good,"not the best of learning environments. marketing and retail are not what I want to spend my time doing when having to see patients as well. Having to order supplies, handle insurance, run your own tests, take your own vitals and do assessment, chart, and then collect money makes seeing 28 people a day very taxing. DOT physicals are now offered and are completely out of the time frame we are expected to see patients in for a walk in retail clinic. Add having to keep track of your labs and sending them off, when to control your tests, having to chart them correctly, keep track of vaccine lot numbers and temperature documentation (order more when needed), and of course doing call backs and recieving emails to call back patients during the day.....it is a one person office nightmare."
good,CVS truly stands for helping people on their path to better health. The company has taken initiatives to improve patient care and customer service at the store.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my experience with CVS. I ONLY left because my supervisor didn't not approve my hours worked after returning from medical leave. So, I wasn't paid for that time until THEY could get it situated. Unacceptable! I should never have to wait for my money"
good,"My pharmacy manager is the only reason why I have stayed with CVS. The upper management is more worried about numbers than the happiness of its employees. That is why our turnover is as bad as it is. Once I leave CVS, I would NEVER recommends this company to anyone."
good,"Management has no idea how to run the team.. With expectations overboard to what each individual, is capable of doing in an 8 hour work day."
good,Within the last year everything has went from good to not so good. I still enjoy my job and the people I work with but HR is slacking. They offer endless amounts of OT time with is great but when you need a day off for any reason it is frown upon in not so many words.
good,"I did alot of insurance verification making sure that the patients medication was covered and if not reaching out and resourcing third parties to assist in the aid of helping the cost of a patients medication. It was a lot of phone work and working with insurance companies and working with the provider offices to obtain authorizations for the medications as well.  Making sure all the proper documentation was accurate.  It was very productive, very busy and lots of work to do there was barely any down time.  I learned alot about different insurances, different medications and how they work and what they work for.  I learned alot about different disease states, I learned about the different resources patient had when they couldn't afford their medication.  My supervisor was the best very understanding, knowledgable and very supportive.  I never had too much interaction with my manager.  My co-workers were very pleasant, easy to work with.  The hardest part of my job was having to tell a patient how much the medication was or that it wasn't covered by the insurance and hearing the hurt in their voices.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the rewards for helping those in need."
good,Excellent benefits! Management wasn't especially helpful.  I learned a lot of skills working with many different computer operating systems.
good,"Very proud of work accomplished with fine dedicated individuals who worked very hard to save the firm millions of dollars annually while providing a needed service to the community. "
good,"You can meet all sorts of people at a pharmacy. The job is never boring and is very rewarding. I became very knowledgeable on different medications and illness during my employment, which was helpful in my life outside of work."
good,"coworkers were easy to get along with and work was easy. •	Dual monitor configuration set up"
good,"Overall good staffing. There were may hard workers, but management seemed impossible to please. Not very understanding of occasional life circumstances, but job security held solid"
good,"Working with the company was a learning experience, I enjoyed helping customers. Working with the employees from coworkers to managers was not a great experience."
good,If you worked in a pharmacy then you know what this is about.  I felt I was underpaid for the amount of hours I was willing to work and shifts I covered but that was more so the management than the company.  Overall no real complaints
good,Good place to learn customer service. Salary and benefits could be better since CVS/Caremark does the customer service for Aetna.
good,"I started CVS back in 2012. I loved it before the many changes in management and corporate policies. I do however get a lot of hours and I am very fortunate for that, but the pay rate is not nearly to par with the situations you endure on a daily basis. If you are looking to start out in a pharmacy environment and want to better your social and multitasking skills then I definitely recommend this CVS. It's just not a job you can really make as a career unless you are a pharmacist."
good,"I fill prescriptions for Long Term Care Facilities, my job is very rewarding knowing that I am sending medications to patients under constant medical care."
good,"CVS is a quite, but busy place to work. There is always something to work on and helpful managers to work with. There is always two people in the store at a time and we have our on jobs to work on so it can be a very solitary job. This job isn't really hard but I miss working with a large group."
good,"Enjoyed my position as Accounts Payable Clerk, and performed my duties proficiently and confidently. The Administrative Office environment was very professional."
good,"The store is a great place to work, the administration above it though puts far to much pressure on their pharmacists and in turn the technicians. More emphasis needs to be placed on their employees and less on their numbers. You rarely if ever will get a lunch because going to lunch means everything gets backed up and you will put everyone else behind. They also don't pay enough to be putting peoples lives in your hands."
good,"Entered patient demographics, verified insurance benefits/diagnosis. I made social worker/patient contact to coordinate delivery and discuss the patient's out of pocket responsibility, if applicable. Created chart and scanned info into our billing system."
good,"I enjoyed working here, up until they changed the management of the company. Then they constantly began to cut the hours for the region, which affected everyone hours except the manager, and instead of just letting you go, they used you for the 4 or 5 hours that no one wanted, which was normally on the weekends.."
good,Great pay . But a very stressful job. Very little help from upper management. Very hard to achieve your goals based on what resources they give you.
good,"Set schedule, great people, managment is good, overtime is mandatory.  They say you can advance but if you are too good at your job they will find ways to keep you in the position."
good,"Hard job, long hours, not enough people working on shift. Stand on your feet all day."
good,Assisted the pharmacists with filling prescriptions and making doctor calls.
good,"If you are late, or miss a day due to very bad weather that is not usual like complete freeze overs that are not normal here in Texas, they do not care,,,, they want you there regardless of conditions. "
good,"long hours start at 8 am till 10 pm  (14 hours) you never get a chance for a break but you need to keep going to make sure patients are being  taking care of. Furthermore physicians and nurses that we interact throughout the day need to be taken care of promptly and professionally."
good,"good starting level work place, but not for long term work life style."
good,"•	Extensive knowledge of health benefit plans and insurance billing"
good,This job had long hours with low pay and little chance for self improvement or personal growth.
good,I have been with cvs for 7 years i have witnessed many managers come and go and have been part of several big changes in regards to the companies name and ways they run things. My pharmacy has a great diversity of employees and we all work very well with one another and have a great open line of communication with each other I feel like we are more of a family then co-worker which is hard to experience in most places.The hardest part of my job would probably have to be trying to help customers to be more understanding in the fact that you are doing everything in your power to make them happy and satisfied with there overall experience.
good,"•	Filled prescriptions"
good,"Enjoy working here. It gives me balance, staff are nice .I have learned a lot for the most part all are helpful.  Interacting with people is the most rewarding thing with the job."
good,"Management needs improvement, but great first job. Learned many skills that will help me in my personal and business future."
good,"On a typical day, I do feed the canisters as medications runs through them, this is what we referred to as opt file .Some times I move to packaging section. Co-workers were always there for each other as we do team work. The had aspect of the job was when all the canisters were out of medicine in them. the most enjoyable part of the job is on packaging."
good,I enjoy working with my co-workers as a team and providing excellent customer service to our customers.
good,"Pulling cases for pickers, maintain a clean and safe work environment, physical work demands while on work floor"
good,it the same as any other retail store such as Walgreen or rite aide but once you get all in and comfortable you will love the environment and the people
good,Cvs is a fun place to work you get to meet a lot of new people and the money isn't that bad considering the fact that i make much more money hourly over there than i do at Wendy's.
good,On a day to day basis I completed many tasks and successfully resolved several unique issues that were presented to me. I learned the value of my own efforts and the dedication I help to a company would benefit me as an individual in the near future. My management team were great. We were able to communicate efficiently to solve any problem and or upcoming changes. The team i worked with is extremely wonderful. I met some hard working individuals that showed what team work was. The hardest part of my job was advancement. Trying to grow and advance within the company took serveral years no matter the efforts you put in. The moment enjoyable part of my position was the rewarding feeling of helping my patients.
good,"I love what I do but with CVS i feel trapped, over worked, and under paid. The PIC is the slowest in the world without any common sense and the co workers are just the same. With always cutting hours and no other techs to help everything falls on one person. How are we suppose to help the customer if we cant even fill their prescription."
good,"One of  the first things you learn at CVS is to stay organized. This was a challenge for new people that saw us as relaxed and not busy. It was an interesting time watching people grow and learn."
good,"Very busy, stores vary greatly in volume.  "
good,the management over works you and treats you like youre worthless. Terrible place to work
good,"the typical day at work i would come in start the mechines up. get thing organized. clean. make sure the paper was all full and the chemicals were filled. i would go online and look at the orders and make sure that they were sent over to the 1 hour mechaine. "
good,"I was pleased to have my job at CVS eeven though it was not for very long. Training to be a tech was a difficult process and it requires much more than just customer service skills. I did appreciate the fact that they do train you to be a pharmacy technician and you do not need to already have a license."
good,I enjoyed meeting people everday. I learned about diferent medications.
good,"A typical day at cvs consists of waiting on customers,answering phones, processing prescriptions and filling prescriptions,checking in deliveries of medications and putting them away.I really learned how to multi-task at that job.The manager of the pharmacy was an absolutely wonderful woman who truly cares about the people she works with and the customers we served.Everyone worked together to make the job easier.The hardest part of the job was store management.The enjoyable part making sure the customers got what they needed."
good,"CVS is well organized, they have an excellent pharmacy system, co-workers are friendly and great friends also. "
good,I work at a computer all day. I am on the phone communicating with nurses to clarify prescriptions and doctors orders. Type in doctor orders and prescriptions so a pharmacist can check them and start the process of filling the script for the patients.
good,"Take rx’s over the phone, fill prescriptions both manually and by cell, do inventory, order medications, translate sigs on scripts and enter data into the system. Process insurance claims, assist customers with billing issues, days supply, coverage. Run register, scheduling, daily operations, signing medications in and out of the pharmacy."
good,"It was a good job, But I worked there until I finished school. I was great working with public."
good,There is hardly any down-time. It is a fast-paced work environment with a retail twist. Customer service is a #1 priority. You will learn and retain a lot of new valuable skills. 
good,"A typical day at work would be i get to work and open all my systems. Check my email to make sure my boss sent a new spreadsheet or if not i would work in my work view."
good,A typical day where I currently work can be very busy and stressful.  There is also a lot of drama.  I have learned so much about medication while working in the pharmacy.  The management has changed several times since I've been there but I think things are finally on the right track.  The job is very stresful and you get yelled at a lot so I think being able to keep your cool and knowing how to handle yourself in difficult situations is the hardest part.  For me the most enjoyable part of my job is the customers.  I love working with people. 
good,"High volume mail order pharmacy, dispensing 22-40K + prescriptions per day."
good,Always learning something new and taking lots of tests after required readings. Most enjoyable part of job is lot of computer keying. Rewarding to help people with their Medicare Part D account.
good,"i would assist customers, help the pharmacist process and fill prescriptions. general management was ok but my pharmacy manager was amazing. i got along with all co-workers is was like a little family. hardest part was sick customers the most enjoyable was helping people. "
good,"This was a place i learned people skills . I learned how to engage customers on a novice level. It was a different kind of work enviorment . co workers and managers interacted in a special way where some days it would prove to be good , others not so much."
good,This pharmacy business was slow for the most part. They will train you everything you need to know about filling prescriptions. If you are thinking about going in to the pharmacy field. I would suggest you start with CVS/Pharmacy
good,This is a great place to work and to learn new and different things.
good,"I feel like I've learned alot in the 12 years I have worked their. Daily task are usually working the register,checking in vendors,making sure everyone is getting there job done. I also have excellent customer services skills."
good,Busy everyday. Learned alot from previous bosses. Last management was not very pleasant to work for. Got along very well with other co-workers. There really was no hard part to my job. Everyday was enjoyable till the very end.
good,this is an awesome pace to work except you do not get enough hours to accomodate your family..
good,not hard place to work at.
good,"Being on your feet all day may be a bit hard on your body, physically. Being able to interact with all kinds of customers is quite rewarding, but demanding at times. The pay is low, and management is a bit iffy at times. All in all, there isn't that much room for improvement, but it is a stable job to have"
good,Enjoyed the variety of work but could have been managed better.
good,I loved the work I was doing. It was just too disorganized. Some people were permitted to take off any time they wanted to leaving us very short handed. A lot of people weren't doing their jobs. I loved doing the medical work. It was very interesting and gratifying.
good,Co-workers are the best....
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting customers, helping them find what they need, and checking them out at the register. I also stock shelves, complete outdates, and ""face"" the entire store. Working for CVS, I've gained a lot of experience and knowledge of the retail world. This is my first retail job so I didn't really know anything about it. Everything I've learned from the proper way to greet customers to stocking shelves and checking in vendors, I've learned from CVS. Management majority of the time gets the job done. However, they could do a better job at scheduling and staff recognition. There really isnt much that's hard about the job but the most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships with the customers."
good,"Filled prescription, Stocked shelves, Answered Phone calls, removed expired prescritions from shelves."
good,"CVS Caremark is a demanding company. There are high expectations for productivity, schedule adherence, accuracy, ect. Overtime is frequent and often expected. The company does pay well and does offer quarterly incentives. Job Security and Advancement are available for younger workers who maintain the required standards."
good,"Typical work day shift was 9pm to 9am, 7 days per week."
good,"A typical day of work consists of coming in checking my emails for updates, contacting customers and healthcare providers, meeting with supervisor to go over any changes or issues with processes and enacting any changes and reporting back with supervisor to provide updates on daily workload. I learned about corporate culture, how to train employees, work with colleagues in project work, and a lot about healthcare, insurance, operational change, and pharmacy operations. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with different healthcare policies and regulations. The most most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of knowing my work allowed our customers to get their medication in a more effective and efficient manners, thus providing them with a higher quality of living."
good,"Worked 4 years there. It had a new boss every year, making it vary in managing styles."
good,"As an employee, it has given me a sense of purpose of learning new tasks.  I love this job because I'm able to work with a great group of people and I love that we give back to the community, especially our senior customers."
good,"I took countless assessments and mini classes in order to advance to a management position. I was told if I did so, I could apply for the position. This was not the case. The position never opened, or was filled with fresh from school students with no job experience. The pay was below the national average for the skills I possessed, and when I asked about completing a certification through the companies program, I was ignored."
good,"great team, always busy, up to date with technology, ability to lead team. good support for field management. great training program. advancement potential. ability to show merchandising skills. your able to control your inventory levels. great work schedule."
good,"The system is a little old and outdated so it makes working there a bit irritating, other than that employees are good and the customers are great too."
good,I did data entry from incoming faxes from hospitals and inwurance companies to set up new cases for patient specialty pharmacy medication orders. These were sent to the pharmacies to fill the orders. I receives a quota every day on how many orders I had to fill that day and meet or exceeded it.
good,"Loved the job. Learned very much at this job.  I had a lot of responsibility on this job, filling prescriptions correctly and dispensing them. I was very accurate and fast at this job and I stood out."
good,"Working on a part-time basis, benefits are not awarded. While my work schedule is flexible, CVS does not really support a part-time position.  The working environment is comparable to other retail pharmacy operations, it does provide for growth in the profession"
good,Low pay and low raises. Though if you work with good people it's not so bad. The majority of managers I worked with were nice and understanding. I personally didn't really have any problems.
good,It was a good job. It was very friendly atmosphere and customer service was top priority. The job made me learn a large amount of skills that will help me in any future job.
good,The best part about working here is that everything is on your own paste and no one really rushes you unless your really not doing anything. Friendly environment as well
good,"Pharmacy is extremely busy, certain customers are extremely rude. Somewhat flexible hours, friendly environment except for some of the rude customers that come in."
good,"CVS is very much the 'fast food' of retail pharmacy. A lot of emphasis is put on filling as many prescriptions as possible, and there isn't a lot of time allotted for patient education."
good,Working at CVS was definitely a great experiene when it comes to learning how to get a whole lot done in a very limited amount of time. You also learn to work efficiently at faster paces.
good,Job was enjoyable. Tasks weren’t challenging enough for me if your looking to grow. You can learn and meet a lot of new people everyday. Was usually only one cashier and one supervisor.
good,Definitely a decent place to work. Job security is sometimes an issue with big companies as such. I would recommend based off other companies that I have heard about.
good,Day at work consisted of processing billing for denial claims for medicare patients. Day shift 7-4:30. Very helpful coworkers. Cafeteria on campus. Fun co-workers
good,They have flexible hours and work with you when you need off. Friendly staff. Amazing managers. Fun atmosphere. Very personal mush like a family. They will be there when you need them the most.
good,Coworker are nice and friendly and so are some of the managers. The managers are  sometimes very understanding and are good people and the environment is a nice one. ( on some days.)
good,"Decent to work there, very stressful environment. Always feels rushed and must be able to tripletask , usually very busy as well.. you do lessen alot fairly quickly"
good,"It was a alright company, I liked working there but I just need time aways because they where working me long hours at night than turn around n have me come in at 7 in the morning"
good,A lot of changes and people are working there in a frenzy sometimes. There is sometimes no communication and no respect among authority and co workers. Pharmacy is short staffed and you have to be ten people at one time. If you cannot multitask you will not survive
good,"I worked in Claim Determination and Appeals for Med D claims. Workload was at my pace, very little direct supervision which is great because I was trained very well. They do often ask for overtime."
good,"CVS Health - Caremark is well known company and is very good. You need to pay very close attention during training because it goes fast and has a lot on information. Typically, calls are back to back, miscellaneous clients each one with diverse rules and regulations and multitask within different programs."
good,Great place to work if you are looking to add to your step count.  There is always something to do.  They care a lot about the customers so definitely be courteous.  You can learn a lot about commonly prescribed medications if you are just starting out in the medical field.
good,Work was easy and slow. Two people unload trailers. Break each pallet down as receiving each item. Then put away and rap each pallet. Forklift operator will put to sorted location.
good,I really liked to work with CVS. I had nice and friendly pharmacists and technicians. I learned a lot from them. Manager is really friendly with me. I learned how to communicate with customers.Still I would like to work with CVS.
good,"Retail isn't for everyone. It can get very busy and stressful at times, but it can also be rewarding to help people who are sick or injured find what they need, or whose family members might be."
good,"I currently work at CVS, I like my job and working with customers and helping people."
good,"You have you daily and weekly duties that must be done. The culture depends on the management. One downside is the lack of hours for front Store employees because it makes getting tasks done sometimes a rushed, but that's with any retail store."
good,"I was a contract employee, it was a great place to work .  I worked on a project that came to an end in september.  I was there from June to September"
good,"It can be a lot of work to run a store, but if you like people and keeping busy, its the place for you. also there are always hours to pick up, and you'll never be bored"
good,Cvs pharmacy is perfect for beginner jobs but not full careers. They will cap your pay. I have worked there for a very long time and have not received a raise.
good,I think CVS Health is overall a great company to work for. I believe upper management employees are biased against retail store employees and a change needs to be made
good,"I did before amazing, fantastic, out of this world, beat feeling I ever had, chance to experience ever had. Able to multiply task and handle patients at the same time"
good,An innovative company that is sure to make waves in the future. I highly suggest people look into this company as a place to work and as a role model for companies wishing to implement triple bottom line sustainable management.
good,"I love how much I learned about the company. I got so much knowledge about  how to be resourceful, and effective pharmacy technician. I really think that CVS know how to treat the employees."
good,"Friendly environment. Work with customer's with filling their prescriptions, answering any questions that they may have, refer them to the pharmacist if needed."
good,"CVS has little regard for its workers, seeing most as replaceable. They do not compensate well, nor do they care how hard their employees work. Often I would work between 50-60hr/wk with no chance of advancement in the company."
good,Truly enjoy interacting with the customers and the pharmacists are eager to teach. The hardest part of the job is working with co-workers who make negative comments about others.
good,"Our goals were to serve the community and address patient needs’ while maintaining high industry standards to fill prescriptions accurately and efficiently in a high volume store. Made sure the patients’ concerns were addressed and made them feel acknowledged all while maintaining a clear sense of urgency.  Demonstrated great time management and does not leave problems behind for others to solve.  In addition, I adapt well to change, a fast learner and remains composed in a high stress environment."
good,Working for 14$ an hour starting pay to put pills in a bottle and work on a computer or with a customer is very easy. Working in the health care professional field is satisfying.
good,great place to work and a good and friendly environment. the pharmacists were always willing to help and the customers who come in always had a smile on their face.
good,I’d rather speak about this in person with a future employer if curious about my working experience with CVS. The company on as a whole was a great company when I started but made many changes that were not employee friendly which made the work place very stressful and unappealing to want to come to work for as time went on. It was very disheartening.
good,The days were always busy as I had a large coverage area. The people were friendly for the most part and always happy to see me. Pay was very good for the type of work done.
good,My experience was comfortable at the beginning they made it possible for me to go to school and work but ended up hard to juggle the two at the same time
good,Lot of scope for learning. Management is mostly supportive. Workplace culture is pretty casual. The Hardest part is lack of work life balance on a few teams.
good,"It was a part time job that I was doing while going to school, I don’t have a exciting review for that period of work history. Nothing more to say at this time"
good,"If you have an opportunity to work in a store close to a tourist spot, then go for it! These will provide you with new experiences on a daily and meeting new people and cultures is awesome!"
good,"ok company. Better than most retail companies. work life balance for store managers is not good, it is a place to get your foundation set and then move on."
good,Still working out kinks in a new call center is always frustrating but overall positive vibes. Some dress code abuse and they are very selective of candidates
good,Good place to work for pharmacy experience. Great place for a starting position job. Also good place to work to gain some experience with customer service.
good,i do not think the employees get a long very well. they don’t get reprimanded for saying things that are out of line. and some of the pharmacists are the rudest people i have ever worked with
good,"Customer service based position. "
good,assisting customers- cashiering-filing- pill counting- printing out prescriptions. i liked traveling to different stores & meeting others that worked at the CVS. Meeting & communicating with customers
good,ExperienceWas great the people was helpful staff was excellent company is a great companyThe manager did a awesome job I learned Of techniques working there and life skills
good,"this is a fast paced job. bust be good at multi tasking. it was a stressful work environment, but the job was manageable and I liked it because it kept me busy"
good,"all employees at both cvs I worked for were just like family, loved being there but had to move due to husbands job for both but would move back and work for either one if I was able to move love this place"
good,"As long as upper management is levelheaded and fair, this is a very good place to work. I enjoyed my time as store Supervisor at CVS, until my boss transferred."
good,Cvs is a very stressful place to work. But if you work hard you can advance and move up rather quickly. Over all I like my job it’s not bad. Stretched a bit thin at times but good.
good,Loved working for them and never was worried about not knowing what to do. Gave us plenty of time to get ready before we got put on call on our own and even once we were on our own you still had plenty of help.
good,"It was a good learning experience "
good,This is a ok company they have great benefits and I would recommend this job to any of my younger family members looking for a good job to build a stable working history with. This company has longevity and has been here for a very long time and they are very understanding
good,"Enjoyable regulars and patient customers are what makes the time go by fast. Stocking merchandise and binning overstock and, on occasion, helping with the photo lab. The hardest part was the commute."
good,"I loved my job at CVS. But it was busy. As a tech I didn't always get to take my breaks because sometimes I would be the only tech there. Every store is different, but i personally loved my location. My pharmacist cared about what he did and cared about all of us techs. My store manager always went above and beyond for all of her employees and made the job something i looked forward to going to everyday. I can't speak for every store, but I really loved this job."
good,I loved working for the company but didn’t feel I could advance my career. People were promoted or moved inside the company but I’m not sure how that process was decided.
good,"Good company to work for, the scheduling is the only bad part you don't have a set schedule and most of the schedules are done  days before you know what your next schedule will be."
good,"CVS is an overall good company to work for. The benefits are wonderful. But there is little room for advancement and management is sometimes not dependable, even sometimes discriminatory. The work day is very rewarding, especially being able to help customers. Overall, it’s a good company to start your retail/pharmaceutical career with, with minor setbacks."
good,CVS gave me the opportunity to advance in the medical field and gain more skills for other positions. Verbally acknowledged and made known that I was valuable.
good,During the overnights depending on if you are in a 24hr store or not these are the quietest times for any store and you would only have to deal with people who needed a few things and have some memorable conversations.
good,Somedays were typical at work where as some were really nice all together a balanced work experience and this was my first work in the health sector industry
good,"the team members treat you with respect, though the manager scheduling was a problem overall I had a good experience working at CVS. It had a good aura that helped you feel at ease."
good,"Great job. Great learning experiences learned. The hardest part was the hours, but for sure doable. Most enjoyable part was the customers, especially the regular customers"
good,"I wouldn’t work for cvs again, they treated the employees like dogs. I was 17 illegally working 60 hours a week, my manager convinced me to drop out of high school and work for her as a shift supervisor. I was fired 6 months later."
good,It’s a very quiet and neat environment to work at. Very friendly employees. Everyone help each other out at all times when needed. I definitely would go back to work at Cvs pharmacy
good,Fast-paced rewarding working experience- working as an associate here taught me valuable organizational skills and valuable communication skills. I understand the need to be quick and direct with customers
good,"Fast-paced"
good,"The Corporate Vision is one that is packaged and presented so beautifully that anyone can get behind it. And I believe that the company does try to stay true to their vision. However, some store management doesn't hold true to the company's values, and that can make it difficult to work there. "
good,"Good place to work, the employees really care for their jobs and customers. As a pharmacy technician, we take pride in getting to know the patients and their lives."
good,Very fast paced and stressful position. Only important thing is the bottom line. Not much room for advancement. Pay and benefits are ok. Schedule issues.
good,At CVS there is always a chance to make improvements.  They give you the opportunity to better educate yourself with reimbursement for any educational courses which pertain to the work place.
good,"Good benefits, and you can make your own schedule. With recent re-alignments in the company, it has made it quite frustrating to work because you dont know what to expect."
good,"A typical corporate environment with good pay, benefits and social a balance. More layers of management than possibly needed. Timings are not very flexible"
good,"It was and will be great, and I will love to go back there. Being around patients was so rewarding you got to know their families and friends in a personal basis."
good,"Learned a lot of new things pertaining to prescriptions handling combined with customer management.  Laws and ethics are top priorities."
good,Its a comfortable place to work. People are nice and helping .Timings are flexible. I am a contractor so didn't get benefits but hourly rate was competitive.
good,I liked working there but got a better job offer and moved to far away to drive back and forth for this job. Was asked to be in the Management program and loved my boss. I learned a lot from her but she left to after a while.
good,"Temporary job while I was obtaining my bachelor's degree. Got along well with coworkers and management. Loved meeting new people and learned a lot about handling money, and working with people."
good,"Great co-workers and manager. Fun experience learning how to work there. Great environment to work at as its purpose is to make a healthier life for people. Only con would be the hourly wage. It is $12 per hour so if you're in need of money, this probably would not be the best option. But otherwise its a great job to gain experience and start a career as a cashier or even as a pharmacist in the back."
good,Working for CVS was very complex. Stocking was very strenuous and towards the ending of my time there I was always put in the storage area to stock shelves. My title was cashier/sales so I was very unhappy. Scheduling was perfect for me. I had a consistent morning shift. Customers were friendly.
good,I gained a lot of knowledge in the pharmacy. Data entry was the most enjoyable and helping customers with their healthecare needs. Good customer service.
good,"I work as a cashier and customer by helping get what they want and also I need more hours. also, I'm good at what I'm doing and I´m a good candidate for any job"
good,"Nice place to work"
good,Management is decent. HIPPA is held to the highest standards. Room for Advancement as long as you put in the work and are a dedicated team player. Variety of jobs within the company.
good,"CVS is a great place to work if you want to go into entry level of pharmacy work, I have been here since 2015. Flexible work hours, great staff and affordable benefits"
good,"Customer satisfaction comes first and that's what's important. the coworkers are friendly, outgoing, and helpful. Management stays on task. Pharmacy puts customers first. great place to work and shop."
good,This was an okay job not to much to do after a few hours. Even though they let you  grow within the company I do not think it is worth it. The pay increase is not that much.
good,Company turn over way to many manager work is always busy the breaks are short and cuts hours the pay is ok for what you are doing but it’s a decent job
good,you get close with everyone you work with. It’s complicated at time you get a lot of couponers which make your day horrible at times but you do get people that are extremely sweet and kind.
good,"Its Retail. If you want to advance, this job gives you room to grow. If you just want a steady paycheck, show up on time, and your job is pretty much secure."
good,"Tend to work long hours. Have opportunities to learn more. However, the more you know sometimes make you too valuable in a position which hinders your ability to move up"
good,Management and daily functions are consistent across the company. The company focuses on patient care and improving pharmacy practice as much as possible. This takes out some of the stress of working in retail pharmacy that some other companies are not able to accomplish.
good,A typical day consists of customer service and providing assistance to customers. The hardest part of the job would be the afternoon and evening rush. Tons of customers come in to get their daily needs.
good,"Great place to work. Works with your schedule, met some great people that I can call friends. I was able to transfer from New York to Virginia easily."
good,I worked temporarily as an intern in the pharmacy and I felt very accepted by the staff. Everyone was very helpful and willing to answer questions for me.
good,"typical day at work is non stop helping cutomers getting perscriptions out at a timely fashion , taking phone call , insurace questions, inventory management, intake new perscriptions , love seeing customers be happy with leaving with there perscriptions, being able to be bilingual( spanish,english) and help those patients that didnt know how to speak english. hardest part of my job having to turn away patients for perscription refills for a later day or time because the workflow and amount of new perscriptions brought in with the new year, i learned to deal with the patients one out of time to my bes tand make them all very important there time and questions ."
good,"Very nice environment, people(other techs) are team. Pharmacist In charge girls(are the worst) but on between we try to work together and have a grate environment."
good,The environment was unprofessional . I once had a supervisor tell me it was not her job to know my job it was her job to supervise. I didn't understand that how do you supervise if you don't know what I'm doing how can you coach me or help me better my self at the job.
good,I enjoyed working with my coworkers. I appreciate everyone's hard work and effort they put in. Challenging and therefore rewarding. The most enjoyable aspect was working with the team and management and servicing their needs.
good,There is some cut back on tech's hour. Everyone has to work harder to fulfill the company's demands. Patients are nice enough to understand the pharmacy's situations and very kind to us.
good,"it’s an okay company, it is definitely a self taught company, you do need patience, lots of it. Management could be better, but my branch director try to tend to our needs as much as she can."
good,"It is very good company, specially when you work full time, more benefits and they work out with you schedule if you are in school. Good team work,I wish if I can go back to work in arlington,tx again."
good,flexible hours as i needed them were given as I asked. I wanted more or less hours/days I got them. The training meetings didn’t work out too good because the store I was at was so busy on the days that I was scheduled to work even though I told my manager I needed off she made me stay to work and I missed a lot of scheduled meetings and was blamed for them. I didn’t expect to be dam near jobless in the summer. I was never told that hours would be token away because summer is slowest of the year at my cvs. I was working 1-2 days a week compared to my 4 day week in the winter and fall. I left for my maternity leave with high hopes of comming back and I couldn’t even return partly because the district manager wouldn’t reverse my termination through the system because my paper work was sent back to them week late which I never found out why because the lady never ever answered or returned my call or email. Also when I called my store I was told that there wasn’t any hours for me anyway if came back so I was told to apply elsewhere. I remember when I was working there and I girl came back off of maternity leave with full time hours and my hours started deducting right after that. But yet when I come back off of maternity leave I have no hours at all. Smh.  It was awful how I was just forgot about and left out and kicked to the curb like that especially after having my baby I wanted to get back to what I was doing I actually liked being in the pharmacy and I made a best work buddy. She was awesome and I miss her. I feel like my stores goal solely focused on numbers like how many
good,"I would do go backs everyday, stacks of them. The food wouldn't be up to date on the expired date. The management was chill, customers where always rude."
good,"CVS has an incredible l executive leadership team in place that continues to innovate and expands the company brand. There is ability to promote within the company as I did. The employee benefits are top notch. The culture differs from location and state. This is a corporate giant who knows how to keep expanding the bar and push the envelop. "
good,"When I first started the culture was good. Now it is horrible. I work in Plainview, NY. Corporate is continually making changes, so be aware. The money is good, you do get raises every year depending on what the company does in a whole; as far as; sales and growth. The people in my area, for the most part are pleasant, but management are not very desirable individuals. It is a good place for growth, and the company benefits are forever growing and changing. It's just the people they hire you have to watch out for. If you don't have a thick skin and cannot handle ignorant people....then this is not the place for you."
good,"Nothing different about this position than other retail pharmacy positions.  Always tough, never enough help though CVS tends to provide more help than others."
good,My favorite part about working at CVS is the 10 hr day/ 3 day a week work schedule. It really worked well for my home-life balance. They also have the traditional full time 5 day a week option as well.
good,"place to work,typical day at work what you learned management workplace culture hardest part of the job the most enjoyable part of the job don't include"
good,It’s a fun job. Very mission driven. Helping people on their path to a better health. That’s the goal and the patients do expect it from you. I would go back.
good,CVS is a very good stepping stool for anyone interested in growing in the IT Field.  Job can be very repetitive and stressful but the days go by quickly.
good,"worked in the pharmacy as a Certified Pharmacy Technician"
good,Wonderful staff to work with. Pay could be better for pharmacy techs given the high volume of work and short staff hours. Very professional environment
good,Was pharmacy technician in the company. Great that the company pays and trains to take the state test to have state pharmacy technician license. Extremely busy environment.
good,Would still be working there if it wasn't for a Company position Layoff. Overall great work environment and liked how you where responsible for multiple stores (7 to 10).
good,"I loved this job, I had an amazing boss who always answered my silly questions to help me learn more on the job. They motivated me to make good grades in school and I just feel it was a great company to work for."
good,"Management needs so much work. They lack communication skills. Other than that it is pretty easy, nothing extraordinary. It is a cool place to work for, they are flexible, and you get vacation pay and sick pay."
good,The people were great but overnight was absolute stress and it was not good for anyone. They expected so much to be done by only 4-6 people and we never really could make what we were set out to complete.
good,A normal work day consisted of 50-60 calls daily. Making sure the patients are aware of their orders and any issues with the account. I enjoyed majority of whom I worked with.
good,"Its the easiest job to get into and make more than minimum wage but its also tiring and you have to go through so much training, But they are extremely annoying about the process and certain things wil prevent you from getting promotions."
good,"They really work around your schedule and offer flexible hours. Not enough hours, can be very stressful at times, job security is low, they cut your hours anytime they chose to. There is no recognition for your hard work and dedication or customer satisfaction."
good,"I was bored with this job, no advancement. There was a lot of driving involved, no breaks. A lot of heavy lifting, repetition, no one really talked to you and you were by yourself."
good,"Typical day was assisting the pharmacist with day to day operations, assisting customers, and being up to date on all of our inventory and quality control"
good,Good company especially for student interns. There seems appropriate work personnel balance in most of the days. Great management employee relation ship
good,"I loved working for the company, they worked with me when it came time for a few of my surgeries. my only complaint is they didnt follow through when they said they would give me a full time position"
good,loved some of the people. the job really focuses on your customer and not you so you cant be worried about your feelings. which is how a public health position should be but when I worked here I was concerned more about me and this was my first position behind the pharmacy counter and although it wasn't the best I miss it now that I'm  not there. low low pay and awful hours can make it impossible to stay no matter how much you want to.
good,"Best part of this job was the closeness you acquired with the patients.Most were great to talk to,not only on a professional level,but as a friend.I looked forward to most days having at least a couple who made my day, either with a good laugh or story"
good,good company but salary paid compared to other companies for thew work you do is not enough. they expect you to work hard and do your best but are very  bad about promoting and giving raises. they also dont give out  a bonus.
good,"Staff I worked with was really helpful upon starting the job. Unfortunately, I had to relocate so the job ended shortly. Otherwise, I would have stayed if not because of the commute."
good,this company is a great place to work. the company provide opportunity and decent hours to help to those seeking the hours. over all i have nothing to say about the company.
good,It was a nice place to work to begin with until changes were made to the name and the supervisors that came on board.  I did advance within the company in a short amount of time.  I learned everything that I could.
good,"Depending on the time of day work CVS/Pharmacy can be very busy, but with good management and a good work force it could have been better. Managers need to communicate jobs more clearly to employees. Also, the pharmacy need better trainers, individuals that actually want to help others."
good,"CVS is retail pharmacy setting. A typical work day involved filling proscriptions, ordering drugs and counseling patients at the drug window.  It was good retail exposure for me as I was in this position early in my career years. So  I learnt a lot in retail pharmacy practice The management was off site, so interactions with the higher management staff was not frequent."
good,On the right track in its merger with Aetna. This will definitely impact Americans across the company in regards to health care and associated costs in some ways better and in some ways worse.
good,some days are long but for the most part it's a easy job. scanning medications in.checking and make sure everything is  correct before going out..and the work moves at a fast speed.
good,"Good Job, Management could be better and I think that the company can afford to pay the technicians more. We do a lot of different tasks and very tedious duties that require higher pay than what is offered."
good,Pharmacy tech was a good job for someone like myself who had just finished college and was unsure what direction I wanted my career to go in. I wouldn't suggest this as a long term career as they redline your salary at something absurd like $15/hr.
good,I came in as I Temp and was just joining with other company no one know what to do at time they had Temp all over the place I just start at bad time for the company
good,"Overall, I was able to learn a lot about pharmacy and that helped me pursue my own career in Pharmacy. There are gaps but that will take time to fix. If given another chance, I would have enjoyed my time working with my co-workers."
good,"Working at CVS was challenging, but it has taught me many things. I think CVS helped prepare me for upcoming job opportunities I may encounter. Coworkers are friendly and so are the customers, the work is fast paced and extremely efficient."
good,"Although I've on worked for CVS for six months, it was a very good experience. I got a chance to learn about the customers and insurance benefits. I had the chance to travel to different store locations to help out when they were short of help. I've had an enjoyable time working with them."
good,"Good place to work, especially store I worked at. We are like family so we help each other, and have each others back. Work together to make our score the best. Helpful coworkers. strong team."
good,"great pay, costly benefits, & poor management. Expensive cafeteria food with low variety. 30 minutes lunch breaks. MANDATORY overtime. No leniency with medical issues."
good,"One of the best teams that I've had the pleasure of working with. In times of stress they pulled together and were able to accomplish great things."
good,learned a lot about different medications working in the pharmacy. learned helpful phone and customer assistance skills. learned about insurance companies and how to do billing . Was a good overall experience expect for my co workers and certain task cvs requires you to do
good,"Typically it was typing up prescriptions and pulling drugs. Filling was also something done typically. I learned how to use the register and the drive thru. Management was alright and the workplace culture was good. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with insurances not covering prescriptions and customers not wanting to understand why it was covered. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to give the customer the satisfaction, when they are able to receive their prescription."
good,I really enjoyed acquiring my pharm tech license and learning the qualities I did during my time with CVS. I experienced what loyal customers were and learned excellent customer service skills
good,"As a CVS team member, I was able to gain a positive work experience along with learning a lot about pharmacy as a whole. Management was very helpful, along with the Pharmacy staff."
good,In the sort time I worked I found it as a workplace highly focused in productivity. I have also seen few team oriented activities like potlucks and birthday celebrations
good,"CVS is a nice company to work for. The entire company bonuses off of sales goals, so even though I don't work in sales, those numbers and actions impact me. There are many individuals who are promoted to leadership roles they are not suited for, but they get those roles to move them into a higher pay bracket. Therefore, leadership can me lacking at times. For a pharmaceutical company, I would think the insurance would be a bit better."
good,"Fast paced environment"
good,"Job can be stressful at times. It is an inbound call center so you do not have a choice to answer, they come in automatically. Management will push you to achieve goals, but are also are supportive and positive.There is possibility for advancement. Must be able to deal with customers that are upset. Need patience and compassion."
good,"I worked with the company for nearly 10 years and only felt appreciated by the ones I worked with directly on a daily basis. Those in higher company positions didn't seem to care much about the employees on the front lines. But you can bet they wanted their metrics and performance numbers met and exceeded every week/month. The job itself was stressful, and being in a position of management (oversaw pharmacy support staff) made it that much more stressful. It was a paycheck, but definitely think that there are better companies out there to work for."
good,The people within the company can be very nice. Not all staff are accommodated equally. They will not always schedule you what you are told you will get. They will put you on for 7+ days in a row. Sometimes you get short shifts and then a really long shift. Mostly closing then opening the next day.
good,"help members with their prescriptions benefits"
good,"this position was always hectic but in a good way. You are constantly pulled in different directions and each day is different from the last. the staff are so easy to get along with and if you all work as a team, you can accomplish wonders!"
good,"The people were great to work alongside, the conferences attended added great value to the role."
good,"- Entry level job"
good,You have to do your time at CVS or Walgreens when starting out as a technician. I enjoyed my time but it is very stressful and the pay is low. My coworkers were great
good,Very sensitive working place as you deal with patients. I loved working there. Cooperative staff with good team work ethics. required hard work and patience.
good,Working here was your typical retail experience. I even got to work at a couple different stores and do fill-ins. The photo center is miserable to manage but it breaks the monotony of everything else. Standing for long hours was terrible on my back. I left just before CVS took away their cigarettes in the back. There's no real culture that I can pinpoint and I didn't learn anything particularly valuable except to deal with customers and couponers.
good,"CVS is a pretty good company to work for. The raises are not the best considering it is one of the top companies to work for. There are opportunities to advance. CVS has many benefits and perks for employees. The training is not that good though. They start out at a decent wage, but you do not get enough in raises to keep your pay competitive. The benefits are good but costly to the employee. You would think that such a good company would have cheaper rates on the health care."
good,This was a temporary summer job while i had a break from nursing school. I enjoyed this work as a costumer service and cashier. some nights were very slow and did a lot of cleaning. Others were very busy. The other employees were nice and i got along with them well. The atmosphere was different on a daily basis. Retail is difficult work but I am appreciative to the experience as it helps me in my nursing career. Over all it was a great job and i am thankful to have had it.
good,I started there before is was Caremark CVS. So I saw the changes over time. I liked the company and the improvements. The reason why I left was because I couldn't advance in the company.
good,I was hired into a start up that was acquired by CVS.  The start-up environment and experience was very rewarding.  I learned a lot about my industry and wore many hats and was able to see the result of my efforts and contributions.
good,Caremark Rx has a typical customer service environment with room and opportunity to grow and improve. There is always help available to assist you whenever needed.
good,My Pharmacy crew was awesome. We all work together and helped each other all the time. Store clerks were awesome but the hours were crazy ones for the pay rate. Lots of work for a minimum salary.
good,"I received my pharmacy technician license, I gained experience and learned more about being a pharmacy technician. I left to have other opportunities at another job. Which lead me to Queens Pharmacy"
good,"ITs an ok place to work as a tech. nothing fun or exciting or anything. Just come to work, do some work and go home. So yeah pretty basic if you just want to slide along in life"
good,CVS has been a good job for me for the last 7 years i feel like every time I’m there i get treated with respect. And everyone who works at cvs are knowing to get the job done.
good,"CVS as a company isn't a bad one, they truely care about their customers and try to make their employees relect this as much as possible. However in my experience I just had terrible management, the superviors are okay, but the store manager and pharmacist can be rude and counterproductive. I have been to other stores and observed the complete opposite. It just depends on who you work with just like any other company. The hardest part is the customers, you have to deal with people yelling at you sometimes for their medications which is understandable but you also get couponers who will scream at you for $0.25. Overall I would recommed this company to other people, just not my personal store."
good,"Great place for work, good team mates, good management, work life balance"
good,Took care of employees and listened to our feedback. Good environment to work at and cared about our personal emergencies and situations. They gave criticism along with incentives.
good,"CVS Pharmacy entails communicating with patients, doctors, and your pharmacist to make sure prescriptions are filled accurately and in a timely manner.  They provide an extensive training where you learn the abbreviations and units of measurement before working in the actual pharmacy."
good,"I only interned here for about eight months so there is not much I have to say. I learned everything I needed to pass my PTCB exam and became very comfortable working in this environment. However, many of the technicians there did not act like they enjoyed their job."
good,I would want to work all day or as many hours as allowed. Communication among employees and managers is necessary given that the topics are work related and productive. I would appreciate working as a team or feeling welcome in the workplace rather than just a placeholder for employment. The most enjoyable part of work would be interacting with customers.
good,My ideas were not recognized. Employees tgat slack stayed there.  Management showed favoritism I couldn't advance within the company as I would have liked too.
good,"Caremark stayed up to date on item availability to avoid issues, kept all the pharmacies stocked due to correct forecasting, and provided all possible coverage for backordered items."
good,It was important in my role to be self-motivated because the store had new management who was learning and trying to train new team leads at the same time.
good,"Fast paced. Great team work. "
good,"My manager was the reason why, I would work for such a low wage. This man is a great asset to the company. I would like it more for him to be acknowledge."
good,Part time job from highschool . At CVS pharmacy I learned how to organize by date an how to change the price an clean an remove expired food an medichon an that all the works work as a team
good,"Friendly Employees, i really have nothing good or bad to say aboutthe company there, timing is just off you give a person a contract allow them to finish it out instead of the season is dying down so i have to let you go really"
good,This place is really professional and helpful with customer .cvs people really care about customers. First priority help with customers by heart. Very good environment for work . And also so many discounts option and coupon system have.
good,CVS is a great company but the benefits are poor and you get overworked and underpaid. I really enjoyed my time though but I will really hope things can change
good,This is good for anyone who wants to start career or possibly stay for a while. Great bene packages and pretty good environment for learning the trade.
good,Very fast paced environment.  Nice employees/co workers. Training program isn’t really hands on or detailed. Most of the learning is online through modules.
good,"Overall, the work experience at CVS was one of exemplary professionalism. The employees displayed diligence and dedication in their line of work. The management was a typical corporate management experience."
good,"Busy from the time the store opens till close.Ringing up the customers, and assisting them with any help. Putting the stock away day by day, taking photos for passports"
good,helping members with their medications and refilling their medications and getting preauthorization for the medications the doctors prescribed them i learned how to help members in many different ways
good,Lack of advancement opportunities. Always demanding more then physically doable with not enough man power to support that. Implementing new services at the last minute and expects results.
good,Not hard work.  But tight payroll. Need to have good time Management skills and good leadership. Must lead by example.  Plenty of room and opportunity to advance in the company.
good,"I researched issues, coded plans and input prior authorizations. I worked at home which made for a great environment. I learned the RX Claims system. I worked with some good people. The indoor cafeteria is really nice. The company provides all of the basic benefits. It is up to the employee to choose what they can afford to contribute for benefits."
good,"CVS Health is a company that provides many benefits for the colleague, but lacks in the work/life balance in the retail locations.  There are many new programs rolling out without a proper amount of time to prepare for the new challenge."
good,"It was always busy and there was always more work to do than there was time. Lots of ethnic diversity there, which was a good thing, but aren't there any employable people in the world other than in India? There was usually someone who could assist if you had questions, but the pace was pretty quick and you'd get behind if you couldn't keep up. Being on call was really really bad though... people had no problems with calling someone during off hours for the littlest thing. Groups work within their silo, and it's sometimes hard to find the right person to work with in another group."
good,"Good for beginners in management. Just like all retail in depends on store location. Some stores are very slow and some are very busy."
good,I have learnt very much at this place. It was very hard in the starting days. But the managers at this place has supported me a lot. And in these present days that experience really worked building my career.
good,I liked working here. I thought it was fun but that was mostly because I had a great team that made everything better. We were all dedicated to creating a good work environment and making our store look good. We all took pride in what we did and tried to help each other. I learned a lot about how to handle difficult people and my manager was very great. My manager took time to assist us all and help us become better in our tasks. He had a great understanding of people and how to use them to their full potential.
good,"Typical closed door PBM call center environment, only the young will have opportunities for advancement, since the work culture is youth oriented.   Job duties are highly micro-managed.  Support staff are underutilized and/or inadequately trained, and pharmacists are therefore required to perform many tasks which are normally delegated to call center representatives and certified technicians."
good,CVS is definately a very busy fast place to work very hard to learn new things due to being kept very busy answering phones taking scripts and helping customers
good,"As a lead tech and inventory specialist I had a hard time designating job tasks due to the lack of help and hours aloud, pharmacists and techs were coming and going quickly. Benefits were good and you got the employee discounts. Over all it was an ok place to work."
good,"It is very structured job, you have to watch your time every minute. they keep track of all your incoming calls as well as how long you are on each call and all conversations are recorded. "
good,"CVS was a great place to work I was about to be a manager before i got layed off. But the customer service was great and had a good caring team to get the work done and make the customers happy. I enjoyed the job alot but there was no career advancement in sight.I learned how to make sure all customers needs were meet and made sure the rest of the team got there part of the job done. It was an easygoing job and nice atmosphere, and in my opinion there was nothing hard to the job just making sure all work got done effeciently."
good,"I enjoy my job in the pharmacy at CVS, however scheduling became a conflict.  The store manager is great, and I got along with the pharmacy manager most of the time.  The other employees were great to work with.  Good experience in general."
good,"Excellent place to work. Willing to work around school schedule, and willing to adjust work schedule. Health and other benefits are great benefits to have."
good,"This was a Pharmacy Tech position, but in a different way. It was second shift filling prescriptions (A Lot Of Them) for various hospitals, nursing homes etc... , but everyone worked together for the most part."
good,"I enjoyed working with customers, but hours were cut due to a new manager in training and it became difficult to make ends meet on just the one pay check"
good,It was a decent but boring job. Only provide part time work. Salary a bit more than minimum wage. You have to greet every customer that comes in the front door. Didn't like that.
good,This is a wonderful job for highschool children. I would definately reccommend. Working here you get to know you community as well as develop critical interpersonal skills. Opportunity for advancement prevalent.
good,"The workplace and staff are friendly and very helpful to one another though everyone had their own duties for the day. Everyday begins with a greet from the person whom sit next to you and leaving the day knowing the goal for the day was accomplished. Every week there is a new task learn and adapt to for individuals or groups. As an overall, the staff went from strangers to being a friend and/or became part of a family which makes the work environment comfortable to be in."
good,Stock merchandise 
good,they are really open to people. they give people a fair chance to get hired. they don't care if you have purple hair and tattoos as long as you can do the job and want to be there.
good,I enjoyed working the prior authorization department. my supervisor was professional and understanding. He would give me set tasks that i would need to complete. it was consise and clear what my job duties were
good,"Fast, stressful, quick. Hardest part of the job is understanding what other people are asking you. It is not bad as long you understand what you are doing. You need to teach yourself a lot things."
good,"Coordinated collection activities for delinquent accounts by preparing info for collection agencies"
good,"CVS Health is a great place to work if you enjoy helping customers as well as connecting with the people you meet. Great company benefits such as discounts on a multitude of items within the store, as well as health benefits."
good,"Loved it. Lovely colleagues, very nice and considerate boss. Comfortable work environment, encourages self growth and career advancements. Would definitely recommend it"
good,"A typical day was not that bad."
good,not much room for advancement and not given a lot of hours. a lot of cutbacks.very fast paced.rude customers.family environment was good.I wish i was given more hours to work i barely could afford rent and gas in my car
good,"workpace is fast, time go by fast, never have enough time to finish unless you have a good team.  The system is complicated when dealing with insurance.  The system is complicated when moving within it."
good,"poorly staffed and low pay; pharmacy manager should be monitored do to too many narcotic prescriptions being filled.  Alot of trainng that goes ignored by most, I am afraid it will cause a mistake."
good,"Retail is retail, there's no getting around that.  The pharmacists and crew were good to work with and I got along well with local management.  It's been over a decade since I worked there though, so I would not take my review too seriously."
good,"There is always something to be done whether it be price changes, stocking shelves, or ringing up the customers. Co-workers were helpful and there if I had any questions."
good,Good place to work and many opportunities for advancement. We would get two fifteen minute breaks for the day plus lunch to get up and walk around or grab a snack. The hardest part of the job was when there was no coverage in certain departments and incoming calls were very hard to forward due to not knowing everyones positions or extensions. It was a very large company.
good,"Long days, but its worth it to help customers get healthier. As long as you have a great partner and nice technicians then it shouldn't be hard to find the energy to get up to go to work every day"
good,"I worked hard there was a lot of work to be done,I got along with most of my co- workers but in all i would work for them again it was a pretty great experience."
good,good place to work but should have patiences to deal with a lot of stress. fact paced hardest part of the job is to keep everyone happy at once. but with smart management you can do anything possible
good,work on holds and ar report the issues involed investigation as well as billing out the claims rebills adjustments.The work place is very fast paced and stressful. Management was never seen only on rare occasion and never any team meetings.
good,I hated it while I was there but I will say that after leaving I learned that some changes were made to help with some of the issues at the location I was at soooo I will say that is definitely a plus.
good,"A great potential work atmosphere.It has many great programs to enhance our awesome customers health.The hardest part of the job is the long hours, but the customers are the most enjoyable part of my day. I have grown with them and there families and enjoy helping them on their path to better health."
good,"Not for the easily stressed.  Access to employee discount, good only if not on sale. Otherwise, sale price given with no discount.  Manager depends on which store one is assigned."
good,"I was a contract worker and did not have the benefits of a permanent employee.  Very senior staff (age-wise), most people have worked at CVS for their entire career."
good,not a very bad place to work at all. both of my head pharmacists that i worked with were very helpful and accomodating. my fellow coworkers were all nice too.
good,"I enjoy working at CVS. I learn something new every day & the pharmacists are helpful in teaching us, as many times as needed. I want to keep learning more about medications, their pronunciation & uses."
good,Large scale company that treats their employees pretty well. The company leaves it up to each store to maintain itself which is nice without the constant micromanagement. Benefits are nice. I suppose the only downside is a lot of hours for not amazing pay but does pay well. Staff is always great to work with!
good,"Very easy, but there was so much micromanaging. Everyone is very friendly and a the cafeteria food is delicious.  The hardest part about the job is double checking your work and memorizing the drugs."
good,I was mainly involved in fixture instillation and parts ordering.We worked 10 hour days and traveled on the weekends. CVS laid me off after the Eckerd stores were converted and went with a less expensive company.
good,The team I worked with at Omnicare was great.  It was very busy and there was never a dull moment.  The management at the time was sketchy but that was over ten years ago.
good,work long hours and drove machines that need alot of repairs. But it is a great place to work ar with steady hours to support your family. THe hardest part about to job is dealing with the broke machines.
good,"Overall a good place to work, remote work opportunities were available. Coming to office was flexible. Manager was very reasonable and did not micro manage.  Interesting project work.Unfortunately I had to leave due to work reduction. Work load was just right."
good,"Great place to start working as a pharmacy tech. Office type setting, cubicles. Friendly atmosphere. Extensive training initially. Good team of supervisors."
good,CVS is a fast paced environment and is very demanding.  I enjoy working for a company that has a purpose and wants to take care of the people we service.
good,I great way to learn about the everyday duties of a pharmacist and get experience in costumer service. Depending on your pharmacy location it can be very fast-paced and the monthly modules are a great learning source.
good,"Managed 16 pharmacies and about 40 plus pharmacists.  Ensured that the district delivered results for the business while providing excellent customer service.  Hired, trained, and developed interns into pharmacist and then into pharmacy managers."
good,"Cvs was one of the best places I ever worked at, they were really good with scheduling and really good at listening to your opinion, but they also didn't understand some things that people go to on a daily basis, kids needs, family emergencies, that kind of thing"
good,"Working at CVS can be fun if you enjoy the fast-paced environment and the people you work with. My goal was to get certified, which I did, and they provided me with the education and experience I needed. I would suggest this job to someone who is a quick learner and enjoys working hard. This job is definitely not for the weak."
good,Productive and very busy workplace.Dispensing and Compounding medication.Supervision of technical staff.Pharmacy paperwork.Workplace culture was situational.Management not conducive to new suggestions.Worked with technical staff that didn't care for Pharmacy teamwork.
good,enjoyed working at CVS pharmacy working with the customers. Good friendly work environment. Had friendly co workers that worked well as a teamm together.
good,I enjoyed working for CVS however the work to home ratio was a difficult one to balance. I had an amazing manager and learned so much from her and I'm forever grateful for her.
good,"The overall company and job was fairly understandable and easy to grasp, however with the workload I did not feel compensation was fair. All in all, I would recommend the company for a start up job, but do not see opportunities for advancement."
good,Received many raises in a short time period. Many options for advancement. There were some customers that were unpleasant but overall it was a decent place to work at.
good,Fast Paced work environment with great co workers who are always eager to help me or anyone else.  Worst part is you never know from week to week how many hours you will be given or what days they will be on.
good,Perfect job for undergraduate students with hopes of pursuing a career as a Pharmacist; Great opportunity to learn about a variety of medications while working closely with a Pharmacist
good,I learned a lot on the job and they were great with having me stay up to date on continuing education credits towards my pharmacy tech license.  That was 3 years ago though.
good,"This was a good job whether you're trying to advance in the field of pharmacy, or learn and apply drug knowledge to the life you live. I would recommend it for an aspiring pharmacist."
good,"CVS pharmacy technicians carry a number of important responsibilities. On a typical day, pharmacy techs collaborate with pharmacists to ensure customers receive quality care and meet all health and safety standards and protocols. Specific job duties include sorting pills, creating labels, reviewing medication side effects, greeting customers, and ringing up purchases. Some CVS locations also contain drive-thru windows, which pharmacy technicians often operate. Additional pharmacy tech job duties vary by location. Training for pharmacy technician jobs usually includes some relevant college coursework and up to a week of in-store training."
good,"Very important that the store is in very good presentable environment"
good,"It took 4 months for me to get my own badge to get into the building.  The organization, distribution, and understanding of the work load is not good.  Some employees work very little compared to others and there was no real measurement or standard. Team meetings often became complaint sessions regarding the disorganization and inconsistencies in the information we used to perform our duties."
good,"Good place to work, but the pay rate is low.Their pay rate is low, but the company made it on the Forbes fortune 500. They made over 2 billion dollars. The company is a pharmacy, yet the medical coverage is mot what you expected from a company in the medical field. They can do better."
good,"As long as you do your job you will keep your job. Not too much responsibility, managers are great. Workload is there and always overtime available."
good,"I loved and I mean LOVED my job in the pharmacy, I didn't mind going to work because every day was something new! In the short time I was there we had two pharmacy managers, both whom were great! I worked every holiday, always willing to come in on my days off, stay over or come in early. I really enjoyed my job. There was a bit of a cash handling mistake one day that I took complete responsibility for. My work ethic was not even taken into consideration when the situation occured, I sat outside the office for over an hour while the store manager and loss prevention talked about Reba McIntyre. When they finally called me in I was informed that I no longer had a job.I definitely recommend, just don't mess up."
good,My experience working for CVS Caremark was overall positive.  The position was an entry level clinical support position in a call center environment.  I left the company because I was hired as a contractor and was offered a permanent position with another company.
good,This was my very real pharmacy job. They started out really professional and went downhill when new management took over. Favorites were shown and from there it became an intense place to work
good,"You have to have great customer service skills, patience, work under stressful tasks. Not always having help or enough staff to complete regular duties, MUST be able to multitask."
good,Have a nice work environment. Colleagues are very friendly to work with. Cafeterias are options are a lot. However we are not using latest technologies.
good,it was a great place to work the hardest part was getting there because of there location. and the clocking in and out of multiple applications for lunch and break. I hated the 30 minute lunch and the food in the cafe was expensive. but i enjoyed the coworkers and the customers. If you get a manager that you can work with you will be fine.
good,My manager is very understanding when it comes to school. She knows I cannot work a lot of hours during the semesters because I have a busy schedule and she does not expect too much from me when I have school.
good,Nice place to work. Very good supervisor....lot of opportunity to grow. Management ensured that you get proper training. Very cooperative colleagues. I was in a busiest pharmacy so the typical days were very busy.
good,"Was trained on the job at CVS to become a pharmacy tech, worked with great people, learned a lot about medications and how the pharmaceutical industry works"
good,"I liked working here, the people were nice and the management was great, but the pay was not good and there was never any question about a raise. The Regional Manager was not very worried about loosing staff."
good,Omnicare is great but cvs took over the first of the year and they are very corporate minded and I feel like some of the employees are slipping through the cracks
good,come in to meet up with each postion then we go off to our positions after the start up meeting and we do wat we did I was a trailer stripper I empty trailers for loaders
good,this job is stressful but it is a great job to have. the people are weird sometimes and the customers can be extremely rude to the workers but you gotta smile and take it which is hard sometimes
good,"The atmosphere for the better part was great, all of my fellow employees and i worked together greatly. we had a large understanding of how the pharmacy functions and supported eachother."
good,"A typical work day as a pharmacy technician consisted of filling prescriptions at drop off, counting medication, helping at the registers, and working on billing issues for customers. During down time, technicians maintain inventory levels and out of date medication. As a pharmacy technician, you learn a lot about different types of medication, which is great if you plan on making a career in the medical field. The hardest part of the job was probably during rush hour/when it got busy, but as long as you stay on top of the tasks, everything was do-able. I was never afraid to ask for help or ask questions whenever I needed to."
good,"it was a wonderful experience also was my first job, and it was seasonal very family oriented and great customer very professional environment great workers."
good,Great place to work with great benefits. Plenty of room for advancement. Wonderful staff to work with. Everyday was an adventure you never had a boring time.
good,"CVS specialty is part of a growing field related to mail-order medication. Depending on the skill level of a employee, they have the opportunity to obtain multiple skills and advances. This is a call center environment dealing with specialty medications with high profile clients. It can be very stressful, especially during enrollment dates. Knowledge of medicare is a big plus when working with these patients. A caring and friendly attitude is a must."
good,I enjoy my job as a pharmacy technician. The people I work with are all great. My only problem is they have had problems communicating who will cover maternity leave for my pharmacists when they both left and we had to struggle through it for weeks
good,I really loved working in the facilities with the medical staff and Director of Nursing.  It was a clinical position making sure each patient had optimal pharmatherapeutic care and working with QA committees to review.
good,workplace culture is very good and lot of scope to learn new things with a nice supporting team. The most enjoyable part is the atmosphere around you where in everyone in the team try or willing to make you comfortable all the time.
good,"This job you always had something to do. There was never a dull moment. the management was great. We all got along, and I loved to joke around with my boss just to get him to smile."
good,I really enjoyed working for CVS but when it came to dealing with management in any way they were usually very rude and inconsiderate. They usually made myself and one pharmacist work alone on very busy days and not seem to care.
good,This was an ok place to work. It was very stressful working at the busiest CVS in town. Some of the customers were very rude. CVS also had lots of paperwork to complete that was completely unnecessary.
good,"This was in all honesty the only position where I have felt like my work place was an extension of my family. The managers were ridiculous with their ""up-sells""  and sales expectations. But in the pharmacy there was a sense of belonging and a united front to the public. Getting the job done was the main priority."
good,"Unsettled environment right now but over all a good experience. People in general were very nice to work with, all were hard working and dedicated to doing the best they could"
good,Any typical pharmacy. All the basics of medicine and dealing with many varieties of customers. Very busy environment but productive! Always something to do.
good,Working at CVs pharmacy store was a great experience . I really enjoyed working with our coworkers/employees everyone had the drive and passion to do better than the cvs standards
good,It was a great beginning to pharmacy. the best is the pharmacist that care. They make sure that the patient gets everything that they need to be healthy.
good,Thy have several locations in the area . They have several different shifts also. I didn't see any room for growth with this company. I enjoyed working in clinical services
good,I think CVS is a good company.  The pay and benefits were comparable to the average similar job in town.  I was quite happy there for a year and a half till our manager went to a store closer to home and the manager brought in to replace him was abusive to the point I walked out (only time in my life I've done that) and made a complaint about him to corporate.  Aside from him there was some petty bickering amongst the women in the store but I think that can happen any time a group of women work together.
good,"CVS Pharmacy is a good company to work for because they provide health benefits, and they have a great stock plan for employees that are interested in purchasing CVS stocks. CVS salary is very low, and should be a higher salary because its a lot of work in the pharmacy and being a pharmacy technician."
good,"Productive and fun workplace, the training is prefect, excellent pharmacist. educational and everyday you learn more about the different kinds of medications."
good,"A typical day at work: several across-teams conference calls, with IT and with sales team, data management, new program building, existing program debugging, coordinating UATs across teams"
good,"Enjoyable workplace, good supervisors, management and comfortable interaction with work associates. Enjoyed interacting by collecting data, confirming technology installation"
good,"at the time I worked there the company was know as Caremark Pharmacy and in my department we were all temps for 2 years and after becoming permanent all 12 of us were laid off and never called back, all of our work was outsourced."
good,"A typical day is, of course, helping customers, filling medications, checking in orders, taking scripts, inputting them. I'd say the most tedious part of the job is dealing with insurance issues. Not all the time does the customer's insurance go through and calls need to be made, to them and their insurance to get the problem solved. Even then it's not always an easy fix."
good,"Opportunity to learn RxCLAIM and pricing set up"
good,My pharmacy team was the best and they are family. the managers are very understanding and the work is not to busy nor to difficult. there is always something to learn and someone willing to teach you
good,"Can be very fast paced and focused on sales. "
good,"The wok=rk/life balance needs to be improved.  This is a work-to =-finish enviroment.  Your shift ends when all the work is completed.  There is no set  time that you leave at the end of the  shift.  You make have to work 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 + hrs a day. Each day is different."
good,"I have been with this company for a long time...a lot have changed since I started. The Work Force Development and CVS give me a great career, Thank you both for the opportunity."
good,My coworkers we great. Management was good as well. Did not get enough hours for my liking but was not my stores fault. They work on a budget of hours given to them by corporate for the techs. Also bay not equivalent to as much work as you do and how much backlash you get from customers.
good,Very fast paced and professional environment. Staff is helpful and cooperative.  I learned a lot and loved helping the patients. The only down fall was the pay.  The salary by no means fit the job description.
good,"cool to work at, i shouldt be forced to write reviews in this page tho cuz its not cool at all, a waste of time, i got things to do like actually try finding a job"
good,"CVS is a great place to work, provides you with many opportunities to work in different areas. Depending on the area you are in it could be hectic. Anyone would find this job an easy one."
good,"Work/Life balance isn't a thing at CVS/Caremark."
good,"Daily work involved juggling assorted tasks and difficult customers. The hardest part of the job was having only 2 staff at night, and not being taught new skills despite asking on numerous occasions to be provided opportunity to learn things beyond the register. Many coworkers told me that I was kept behind register despite my requests because I was very good with customers."
good,Metrics minded corporation but can't complain otherwise. They have the health of the patient in mind but also require a lot of checklists to be completed that make it difficult to complete all tasks
good,CVS inside of Target is a great place to work. Obviously has the metrics minded corporation requirements of any chain pharmacy but the Target atmosphere allows you to have personal relationships with guests
good,"I enjoy working for the company the individuals that work there is the problem, I feel like there is a lot of racism/ prejudice that take place at my current location"
good,"Some of the things I do at CVS is manager large amount of money, take in large truck deliveries, maintain and run the entire store, including cleaning, stocking, inventory, order store supplies and allot of other duties as well."
good,"nice environment friendly people with great benefits, but the policies are not so great. Not flexible at all, so not a great job for full time mother and student."
good,Count and fill prescription daily. Make and receive phone calls regarding patients medication.  Bill insurance and order drug for the pharmacy weekly.
good,"A decent place to work. Decent benefit, good team work in my area. "
good,I enjoy my position with Coram/CVS Health. I am afforded the autonomy to manage my territory as I see fit. My manager knows that I know how things work in my geographic area. She provides guidance as needed.
good,"This is where I learned how to be detail orient because if you made a mistake in a individuals prescription, it could be a deadly mistake.  I worked at several locations for this company because I trained a lot of the newest employees."
good,My time when i worked here it was great never had any issues learned different systems and really was able to learn about the insurance side of medication.
good,"Retail Pharmacy is not a fun place to work especially when you are working for Big chains. There is no more respect for this profession."
good,"typical day at work would be handling prescriptions, answering phone calls, cashier, and sorting pills. Most importantly greeting customers and providing a safe and healthy experience. Also keeping all information confidential."
good,empresa para obtener conocimientos y desarrollo profesional
good,Working as a pharmacy tech was very fast pace. You learn so much about medications and can really help you advance if you choose to work in the medical field.
good,"Consistently satisfactory employment experience. Excellent environment to learn how to operate in a fast-paced environment. Much is expected, but adequate training is provided."
good,"Typical day is average. I learned new things and gain important experience there.  The workplace culture is average office environment, but there was a committee for holidays and special events that made it enjoyable place to work."
good,Management was willing to negotiate overtime hours. Work environment was relaxed while still being production orientated. Monthly company sponsored lunches and activities.
good,"CVS just took over Omnicare, so it will be a little while before seeing full effect of the changes. So far from what I've seen, things look promising. Benefits are great, in my opinion"
good,Working for CVS was very eye-opening. I had never worked in the medical or health care field before outside of insurance and it was fascinating to get the glimpse that I did working for CVS.
good,"productive workplace busy from start of shift until the end of shift, 2 weeks training is not enough, high employee turnover rate. parking is to far, you feel like you never get all your work done, Communication mostly done by email within office."
good,I liked working there. I liked taking with customers and counting medication. It was a great experience. I have learned that no matter what your day is like some customers can make you smile. There were some problems that I had to deal with but I handled them in a friendly manner. If was not able to answer customer question I made I got someone who could.
good,"Working at CVS was exhausting , schedule changes , mandatory overtime , it was rewarding to be able to help the members and learn they do need to take more time in training and smaller classes would bennifit the company,The new employee would feel more knowledgeable about the company and what is required not so structured that you feel if you walk wrong you will lose your job."
good,"Great benefits and salary, however pharmacy staff is extremely overworked and consistently short-staffed. Rph often has to stay hours extra to make up for lack of tech hours. It felt like management cared more about the numbers than patient care/employees."
good,It was very stressful at times and the rules are set up in a way that the customer will never be wrong even if they are. Sometimes customers are very rude and refuse to give us a break. Mentally taxing.
good,"I am happy here but job timing is not suitable for me, especialy"
good,The work environment and expectations at a chain pharmacy allowed me to properly grow and gain enough confidence situations that occur at such locations.
good,co-workers and regular customers made this job fun everybody was family  not many advancements for techs but they try to keep those that are good at their jobs happy insurance package for families left something to be desired
good,I liked working for CVS as a marketing assistant for many different reasons but what it really benefit is working habits customer services and organize grouping it is a good job for a big company that has many benefits and learning tips that can help u success in future jobs or working positions.
good,"I see lots of different kinds of people every day, that is my favorite part. I am very busy doing many things at one time such as answering phones and imputing on the computer.  We are very fast paced but accuracy is a must."
good,"I took this position but never felt I could own it.  I was hired full-time but the person I reported to did not seem to want to release any duties to me."
good,It's a good place to work. Good place to start your career. Really good hours for work/life balance. Scheduling can be a little difficult but overall.
good,"Working at CVS can be a busy fulfilled day. I spend my days interacting with customers, maintaining cleanliness, and keeping the store organized. The hardest part of the job is trying to complete the truck in a timely fashion while also having to keep stopping to help customers."
good,typical day at work was helping others. i learned to be a Pharmacy technician. hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that we sick.  I really enjoyed helping most customers
good,"The management was alright, as was the work load.  Second shift often times had a chance to receive overtime.  There was little in the way of advancement within the company.  Overall it was a decent job."
good,This company offers good benefits but can be stressful if working at a high volume store because hours are very tight. Pay can be low in the pharmacy when compared to other companies but it's a good way to gain experience if you're interested in working as a pharmacy tech. Work environment will vary from store to store.
good,"I was a pharmacy tech in CVS pharmacy.  It was a fast paced environment and customer oriented.  It included processing prescriptions and counting out medications, as well as stocking, organizing, and handling customer complaints.  Cashier experience as well."
good,"CVS has been a good company to work for, all in all a fairly easy job. I was there 5 short months before my hard work was recognized and I was promoted to Shift leader. My store manager has been amazing and has taught me so much and has shown great faith in me."
good,It as been a while since I've worked here. Can't say much in regards to how the company/job is since it's been over 4 years since I've worked there. Not the best store that I was at.
good,"Enjoyed working with public, team atmosphere, consistent schedule, time constraints on calls, not able to resolve issues outside limits of caller's plan"
good,"-Good benefits"
good,It was really fast paced and busy which wasn't too bad. Sometimes didn't have enough staff. and there was always different pharmacists coming in and out.
good,I prefer not to comment on CVS while still currently employed there.  As with any company there are good points and not so good points.  Work/life balance can be difficult if you are salaried and there is a lot of favoritism.
good,When I was there the staff was A+. From management down. It was fun and stressful all at the same time. Everyone was there to help each other even if corporates demands where unreasonable everyone came together to get the job done. We felt valued by upper management and it made it worth the extra effort needed to get the task done.
good,Workspace is not ideal - no privacy (open cubicles).  Technology is there to work efficiently.  Not much support from administration.  Great place to learn.
good,"Love this company and my co-workers.  The environment was laid back and I had great support from my managers."
good,The position for medical enrollment coordinator was a contract position I there for almost a year.  Management was great when addressing concerns with employees or on one on one. very friendly place to work. Left this position due to lay off.
good,"Depending on which department, manager and team you're assigned to makes this employer a cool place to work. Advancement needs a good work-out! Done!!"
good,Training was not that great consider employees personal life there is no attendance policy no availability to flex time ..company does show alot of employee appreciation
good,A great place to work and great compensation. Work life balance is great. there is room for development and room for growth. The staffers are friendly and always willing to help. Great team work.
good,"A typical day is lots of running around at my location, especially nights - you will always have something to do! It takes awhile to pick up on everything and learn how to do it all, but the best way to learn is fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants. The hardest part of the job is probably dealing with insurance, prior authorizations, and those few upset customers who give you a hard time. The other, happy and regular customers who are understanding make it all worth it though."
good,"Worked with a very good crew."
good,"Would walk in to pharmacy and view workstation board to see which station I would start my shift at. Would later rotate to a different station when I was scheduled to. Would assist patients and counsel them on their meds when needed as well as assist in answering phones.  On days when weekly stock orders would arrive, I would check them in, organize and distribute them whereever needed. If closing, towards the end of my shift would submit daily med orders."
good,I really enjoyed my job.  I was always busy doing something. It did require a lot of customer service.  Always met really nice customers.
good,A typical day at work consists of multi-tasking and working as a team to provide our customers the best service possible. I learned leadership skills such as delegating workload to get the job done efficiently & accurately. Managing a team & the store in terms of inventory. Most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my customers go home with a smile on their faces.
good,I loved working for cvs and enjoyed helping customers. I didn't like my particular manger st my store but the job itself was enjoyable and had a lot of potential for advancement.
good,I enjoy working for CVS Health. I have learned a lot about the pharmacy industry over the past 3 years. Leadership is strong and mostly positive.
good,"it was a good company to work for but not safe when i worked there, store was robbed to many times, The store needed security when i worked there. I security now when i do my shopping."
good,"Friendly work place. I like my managers, so friendly and helpful."
good,Good place to work.  Staff is very friendly. Could be a little more appreciative in their employees  but overall good company.
good,"During the my time at CVS I was able to learn so many skills I didnt already have. I was lucky enough to get along and work well as a team with all my co-workers. I was able to train new employees as needed, and get to know our regular customers.This was a great job."
good,"working here is great, they care about the patient's well being and health. Which other companies only care about the money. The benefits are good, 401k with a great match also able to purchase company stock."
good,I would have stayed with the company however I had moved and there was no opening near my new home. Great atmosphere and friendly management. Pay scale a bit low at the time but it was good for my first job.
good,Pharmacy Tech in call center.  Busy with trying to maintain queue for patients with chronic conditions.  Co-workers were somewhat helpful. Difficult to keep up with quotas as inbound calls were screened by untrained personnel.
good,"CVS was a very cool place to work,  I enjoyed the customers that I assisted. And learning more about the technical side of the job was also enjoyable."
good,"This was my first job after graduating from college.great benefits,ok management staff.Provided great customer service.cowork was great people.Hardest part of the job was i see people spending so much money for one medication that they needed."
good,"Omnicare Clinical Research is no longer in business. They were purchased by Chiltern. I had a wonderful experience at Omnicare, the staff was one of the best parts of my job."
good,"Give us your opinion about a typical day at work, what you learned, management, your co-workers, hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I loved working at CVS, however in downtown Grand Rapids, you're guaranteed to have some unwanted behavior from customers. The coworkers were all hardworking and accepted me easily."
good,"Friendly and faced paced work environment. Management is friendly and is a great company to work for. Always growing, changing and keeping you on your toes."
good,Management is great.  We work as a team.  We are responsible for own station.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that we get to know the customers on a personal level.
good,Clocking into the phone system and taking calls from member about their medications. Placing refills for medications and also checking why not able to get medications at the time. Research claims and also do follow ups with members about issue that may take more that 24 hrs.
good,High turn over rate. You need a flexible schedule.  New workers work holidays. Alot of standing.  Know registers.  Fast pace. Good schedule for students
good,"It's great for people like students looking for a job with a flexible schedule.  You need to be a very patient person to deal with all types of people in a polite matter. The pay is low and what you would expect for a retail job. I'm lucky this job is not my primary income.  And your daily work experience is greatly dependent on the coworkers you have.  Managers are often overworked with little time off and can easily work 60 hour weeks.  And it is often understaffed for the amount of work that needs to get done.  The retail front end is open every day of the year, yes Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, New Years Day. But Pharmacy hours may differ."
good,Work hard throw out garbage operate dishwasher put the dishes in place.  Mop set the dishwasher at closing time for next day.
good,CVS is a great place to work and start to a career. its a good stepping stone and place to work to advance. Management could be better at times.
good,During the time I was with the company it was both a great place to be at times as well as a not so great place to work. The individual leaders with-in the company have both helped and hurt the experience at CVS.
good,"I enjoy helping people, I would like to have full time position with 40 hours per week. The fast pace makes the days go by quickly, and I love to remain busy with things to do."
good,"It is a corporation and you have to deal with trying to reach unrealistic numbers typically with insufficient help and minimal raises. But when you can help that one person with their prescription or understand something and the genuinely appreciate it, its definitely worth it. I have known of many worse jobs!"
good,"Very fast pace but co-workers are great and fun to work with."
good,"Loved my patients and coworkers, a great learning and career developing experience for me. As I get better in my field of practice."
good,Great environment. Opportunity to help others with prescription benefits. I really enjoy working for cvs caremark. The pay is decent and benefits are ok. No complaints
good,Great place to work was consolidated to Pittsburgh. Great co-workers and boss. The only downside was the pay compared to the responsibility.
good,"My favorite part of the job is problem solving through process improvement.  Helping others do their jobs faster, more efficiently, and with reduced drudgery was the most rewarding."
good,The people at Microwize are amazing and will do anything to help. It is however not a place where you can expect to advance very far. Stay with the company for 1 - 2 years to learn and then find something with more promise for the future.
good,"I definitely recommend this to anyone willing to start in the industry of  a CCR. Very kind people that work there as well as there management. Only thing i had an issue with was the policy on restroom breaks, in the case to where you absolute needed to go the the bathroom it would go against your stats and risk your work flow and could cause termination."
good,"I worked at a busy store, typical customer demographic, but the co-workers made the job a blast. The hardest part of the job was dealing with frustrating customers but it was ALWAYS worth the experience to learn from them"
good,"For the most part its a good opportunity for people who need job experience. I do believe that once in management you have to be willing to step it up and work HARD, if you have a good work ethic you'll survive. I loved the challenges of management."
good,"It was okay company, But they had certain employee get away with certain things or leave work when they want to and you left doing their work and staying late sometimes"
good,"Manage all task. A great leader , ,  team leader ,good model with  co-workers,  hard part ,CUSTOMER not satisfy ."
good,"Easy system to learn"
good,Always something to do. That is good because it helps time go  quickly. Needs more hours for employees to work. Co worker are alright it just depends on what you expect of them.
good,Helping customers finding product and or ringing them out.My management team needs help hiring people. I've learned that my communication skills are very good and it helps people laugh. My co-workers are pretty easy going.
good,"CVS is a wonderful company that provides exceptional personal service and as an employee provides a very flexible schedule. Working at a heavy volume store, serving at least 200 patients a day and answering about 100+ calls within an 8 hour shift, also filling over 900 scripts a day, i've learned that hard work pays off when you remain humble, vigilant, focused and set a goal for yourself during your shift."
good,CVS was a wonderful company to work for.  I worked at the Batavia location but was placed in other locations for learning purposes.  They truly guide you through what you need to know to be successful at your job.  Employees are happy and enjoy what they do which really lights the place up.  Patient's are always the focus and we always created time to speak with them thoroughly when they had questions or concerns.  We never wants patient's leaving their having any doubts or questions about their medications or equipment.
good,Working at CVS was a great experience. The staff are all very helpful and understanding. Great place to start out if you are interested in pharmacy. Glad I was able to be there.
good,The staff is easy going and are relatable. It is a fast paced work environment with some down time. Great for someone who likes to work independently.
good,A good working environment with excellent co workers. The pharmacy manager was flexible and worked will with his team. The job was fast paced and required a lot of customer contact.
good,"I learn something new every day under the supervision of the Pharmacist in charge.  My coworkers are great, and the hours are flexible."
good,Productive and diverse working environment. Management is great. The location is just very far and the pay can be better for the job duties required from employees.
good,I was hired as a contract worker over the summer of 2015 to aid in various projects with looming deadlines. I learned how to create and format professional looking presentations as well as collect and interpret data from various outlets pertaining to our project. I was independently contracted and did all of my work alone or under the supervision of my superior. The most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with my boss to iron out final details to perfect projects.
good,"Good company to work for work life balance was okay, management was great,benefits were great pay was not the greatest for how much work you do."
good,CVS was a fine place to work in this job title.  I did not work on the floor so have no idea how this would be.  I worked a very open schedule.
good,"over all i feel its good to work with cvs health.i ve learned a lot and all my colleagues are friendly ,kind moving and helpful to each other.i ve gained a lot which is very much useful for my career"
good,To learn the experience of pharmacy it is a great place to start with many departments offered to gain insight if this is the occupational opportunity for you
good,it was a great place to work at. team work was the key to productivity. we had manager and beautiful force of techs working in collaboration towards acheivement of required goals.
good,"Good place to work, as long as you don't mind telephones, Interdepartment communication could be better. Always lacking information that should have been given"
good,fast paced very busy detail oriented  always ways to learn more and advance nice co workers helpful pharmacist to answer questions
good,Ive had a 50/50 (good/bad ) experience while being with cvs. It gets better as you learn the system.Stable job. room for improvement or promotions. Great ppl
good,My job at CVS was nice. Typical day at work can be a little stressful. I learned a lot about myself and a lot about time management. My co-workers were very helpful in allowing me to succeed. The hardest part of the job was probably the stress. Sometimes there's just not enough help in the pharmacy and you get thrown 30 things on your plate at once. There were some good parts including getting to make customers/patients smile and make their days better.
good,"I like my job!  In the pharmacy, we truly work as a team. We rotate  positions every 2 hours to maintain up-to-date-knowledge and mental alertness. I learned about the medicines and their usages.  This is very helpful in general life. My PIC is overall very supportive of me and politely answers any medicinal questions I have. My co-workers, we just are a team.  We all pitch in if an area is overwhelmed and support each other regularly. To me, the hardest part of the job is when numerous customers come in at once with prescriptions. I know many of our patients and have developed a professional relationship with them. When it gets so busy though, I must just keep moving. They say they understand. I enjoy all of the job aspects. I like working with people, numbers, and learning about the medicines."
good,"Great co-workers; enjoyed filling my hours. Fantastic boss. Ruined my tan though; I'm an outdoors soul. Typical day runs 10 - 12 hours; database easy to navigate though dealing with the clientele could sometimes bring on a slight case of WTF? . Learned lots about drugs. Hardest part - dealing the the company itself, the politics and red tape."
good,"i overall enjoy my job, its a great experience without having to deal with the school work of getting here. walking in and putting on my lab coat signing in and getting right down to work. having to accurately count prescriptions and insurance claims, working along side the pharmacist to help make their job that much easier. providing excellent customer service to whomever may come in."
good,Cool place to work. Was offered permanent employment but their hiring process was very long and difficult. The environment was awesome the work labor was not much at all
good,They are a great company to start out with in order to getting certified. The downfall is they do not pay to keep their technicians once they are certified and seem to over work them.
good,"typical day involves inputting prescriptions, updating inventory, assisting the pharmacist, serving the customers and ensuring they are in and out within a reasonable amount of time, and putting up stock."
good,A very fast paced working environment. Learned about different medications and the effects it have on the human body. Management was okay but could have used some adjustments. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing regular customers and being able to make them smile or them even remembering my name.
good,pay is not sufficient which leads to high turnover with employees.  seeing patients/customers on a regular basis allows you to become familiar with his/her individual needs. it is nice to be able to make a difference in peoples' lives.
good,Good place to work for. Have access to target store. Good move for cvs to buy target pharmacy. Busy place
good,Fun place to work. Really helps to build people and become better by requiring you to do all tasks as a technician.
good,"I had learned a lot from CVS pharmacy. System, deal with customers, what to do when the system is down. everything that a tech need to know. Nice team, great manager. I really enjoyed CVS"
good,"My team has a very good work flow. Whether it's a slow day, or one of the most hectic days the pharmacy has seen, we manage to work together to see that every customer is helped and leaves satisfied. Although it can be difficult during high volume hours to try to meet every customer's needs in a timely fashion, it's definitely worth it when I know we've truly helped out a patient in need and made sure they left feeling assured that they were in good hands."
good,"On a typical day, deal with unexpected issues that pop up. Learned a lot about claims moving through the system. The hardest part is keeping track of all the interrelated systems."
good,Omnicare is a good place to work. My co-workers are more like family. Management is friendly and supportive. Flexible hours are great.
good,At CVS i was responsible for stock as well as interacting with any of the questions or concerns of patrons. I made sure the shelves were always stocked as well as kept count of anything that we may have needed to order more of in the stock room. My coworkers there were always very happy to help if it was needed and often offered advice on things that i could do to make myself stand out in a good way. Management was always respectful and handled any customer situations that i myself could not do alone.
good,the intention is there. i love the company. the scheduling being based on the year before's sales doesn't make sense. The best thing I have learned from the job is patience.
good,"can be stressful but depending on the people you work with can make it easy. Answering phones talking to customers, typing prescriptions are just some of the jobs i do"
good,working at Omnicare consist of answering inbound calls about the safety net foundation . customers would call in with question regarding applying for the safety net foundation.
good,"On a typical day I managed a pick-up station, where customers came to pick up medications and were counseled by pharmacists for any questions and concerns they had.  I was expected to deliver exceptional customer service during all interactions and transactions, which focused on having a laser focus on customers ensuring that their experience was satisfying.  Alongside other co-workers, the objective always was our ability in striving to meet customer expectations in the filling and processing prescriptions, done with accuracy and efficiency, ensuring the proper medication was distributed to customers and done in a timely fashion."
good,"Loved working at CVS, but the training at the beginning is too much to handle. would be ideal to train at exact store rather than going 5-10 miles away just for 4 hrs."
good,"good place to work and learn only if you are working in Pharmacy department not in front store."
good,"This is a large corporate environment, and with that come a lot of advantages and disadvantages.  The typical day was spent at a computer reviewing prescription claims."
good,"The job was not difficult, however, managing football during the summer along with this job was rather taxing, If my schedule was a more liberal, then I would have enjoyed the job a lot more. Co-workers weren't the best, but we made it work. I learned how to help customers find products and answer any questions that they have. The management was inconsistent as there was not a constant individual in that position. The most enjoyable part was bringing all the products onto the shelves to be stocked. The hardest part was making my rounds to be sure that all products were faced."
good,"Non stop work, great employers, team work environment, fantastic training, decent benefits, flexible hours."
good,CVS is good place to learn so many things and its management is good. I learnt so many things personally and professional .
good,The company changed dramatically since I started  as intern 12 years ago. Some of the changes are great other should be modified.
good,"Hardest part is dealing with a  troubling customer, but it's a very good feeling dealing with that customer, and you guys come to a mutual understanding. I've learned that I have the skills of not cracking under pressure, ability to train people, and  I can make the people around me perform better. The most enjoyable thing is conversing with people with positive attitudes."
good,"I liked my time at CVS, but it didn't provide me enough hours.The staff and manager was nice and easy to work with. The store was always clean when I worked there."
good,"Being a supervisor my typical day consists of cash management, customer service, working with and teaching new members of the team. I enjoy working there because I enjoy helping people."
good,It is a great place to work.  It is also a great place to learn new skills that can benefit you for future jobs. I enjoyed the people and the customers that we had in the store. I would recommend working in the pharmacy department.
good,Working for this company is great. The management pushes you to better educate you on knowledge. They also offer advancement for exams to be nationally certified.
good,Days are always hectic and can get that way very quickly but it's great seeing the relief on the customers face when any issues that may arise gets resolved.
good,"I can only speak for the department that I worked in, they are a tight-knit group of people. While everywhere you go you will find cliques, depending on what shift you work some cliques are like those found in high school and others are open to newcomers.  In a typical day, you can work as many as three stations, or you could find yourself stuck in one spot for as longs as five and a half hours, this of course depends on where you rank in the cliques, who control the schedule."
good,I worked at CVS for 120 hours as a technician after doing an program. It was a nice environment to work in. The people were very nice
good,HCA is a great company. They treated and respected employees to the fullest. I enjoyed every min there and enjoyed working with the staff. One of the most easiest jobs and would do it again!
good,"Good place to work nice people. Its all about good patient care, it you love helping people this is the best place to start."
good,"Like most fortune 25 company's, the employee experience depends entirely on what region, state and part of the organization one works for.  Great Corporate experience in Rhode Island, where the leaders are inspiring, however, not always cascaded within the stores, where leaders could be less effective.  Overall, great organization that takes pride in its brand."
good,"this was a great company to work for but like any large company there are going to be clicks and managers trying to redo the budget and that means to cut employees.  The managers do not care about time served or loyalty...chop, chop bye."
good,"I plan by day accordingly to accomplish my activites."
good,it is great company but work there is very stressing and a lot to do . they don't care about their employee as much as their profit but it is well organized save place to work
good,"Monitoring and making sure all the pool rules are being enforced to create a safe environment. I learned first aid and CPR even though it was a requirement it's an essential skill to know. Direct management is great, but upper management isn't to involved with the employees. My coworkers where always fun to work with which was the most enjoyable part for me."
good,"There is a lot to learn in the pharmacy, especially handling some many different types of medications. It's a fast paced environment that always keeps you moving."
good,Driving company business metrics for success and ensuring continuous improvement throughout the organization for growth and opportunity amongst all colleagues.
good,"This is a good starting job for anyone wanting to get started int he workplace. It's a clean environment, encourages learning and has a good balance of rush times vs. calm. There is always something to do as well, no chance for sitting around."
good,"Best company to work for, great co-workers, learnt a lot about medication. Good management and workflow. I always look forward to each working day as I want to help people make a difference in their health by helping fill their medication."
good,"Good place to work, closer to home, good clients, good colleges to work with. Very challenging but satisfying job working at night, as you are only around to help them."
good,Great opportunities for advancement.  Friendly staff and management.  Hard working and a customer service skills are a must.
good,"Some coworkers were very difficult to work with. I did have to fire two people in the time I worked there. Had many responsibilities from counting, inputting, and depositing money to store marketing."
good,This position was a great learning experience but had little room to grow and progress. Through A-Line staffing it had potential for a direct hire with CVS but very few in the small office were offered this advancement. Without the direct CVS hire there are no healthcare plans or room to advance.
good,Before I got this job I wasn't sure what a Pharmacy Tech was but I was quickly acclimated and welcomed. I am glad I was offered this opportunity.
good,"Flexible Hours, Very busy stores,stressful, high turnover rate with cashiers, Work through any weather. Working for a large company has many possibilities for movement. you have to be organized and a good at multi tasking,"
good,Great place to work. The environment is very welcoming. The people there are fun . Management is very understanding. Would recommend to anyone.
good,"Happy work culture"
good,"Antibiotics , Anticoagulant & TPN Dosing Department.Total patenrteral nutrition dosing and compounding     "
good,"Enjoyable work atmosphere with great people to work with. Very much enjoyed working with store managers. Hardest part of job was handling angry customers, but provided excellent opportunity to use customer service skills to resolve their issues and ultimately have them leave the store satisfied."
good,"I enjoy being a pharmacy technician.  My job mostly consisted of entering patient information, prescriptions, and doing prior authorizations.  I also filled and sold prescriptions to patients.  I was a certified technician but let it expire as I was going back to school for medical records.  I do plan on taking this test in the next 6 months to become certified.  The hardest part of this job is dealing with situations that are out of your control.  Many times patients need their medication but the insurance companies do not corporate to get the patients needs met.  The most enjoyable part to this job is the satisfaction of working in the medical field and helping the patients with insurance issues.  Working as a team in the pharmacy is important to get the job done efficiency without errors."
good,Good company. Promote internally first.  High expectations of employees and great customer service.  The course the company is taking is a great.  Heath care oriented and has the patient/customer first.
good,"I enjoy working with my fellow CVS Employees in the environment that CVS provides. Although it is sometimes very demanding, the work flow and personal interactions with both customers and coworkers is overall positive."
good,"I currently am a relief pharmacist for CVS, so I usually get 1-2 days per week that I am able to pick up to help them out with their staffing needs. I usually am the pharmacist that opens the store, so I will always get there 20-30 minutes early to prep for the day. The software is extremely helpful for guiding you as to what you need to do next, and in it's documentation of when things were done and why. I enjoy that I float to different stores on a daily basis, as it helps me see how different places do things and meet new people."
good,"Ive worked at CVS for a few years. My pay doesn't show it but they recently went up and now there starting pay is 9.00. They give an OK Raise yearly. A typical day at CVS can be pretty good, boring, chaotic or drama filled. It changes everyday. You develop a friendship with the people you work with and there all like a second family. The Hardest Part of the job is some of the workers, they way they speak to one another is disrespectful at times. But the most enjoyable part is the friendly customers that you see daily. Management honestly seems as if there all over the place and cant do their work efficiently. Overall there a decent place to work but they do not have the hours to compensate for a decent living. The customers make this store a great environment."
good,"The company is very focused on providing a superior pharmacy experience to their customers, either in-store, on-line, or via a different channel. It was a good experience to have worked there."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them everyday. You have to work hard everyday to succeed at what you do.
good,I have been working in CVS for several years now . So far i have gained a lot of work experiance starting from typing prescriptions and filling to ways for good customer service .
good,The group I worked in was very knowledgeable.  The company management was very weak.  Over 250 people got laid off when the company was sold.
good,"My job environment overall is a positive place to be.  I enjoy helping people with their health concerns and other needs.  Having to work holidays and weekends can be daunting, but I am a team player, and am willing to do so.  ."
good,"I learned lots of new skills at this job."
good,"Managed staff of 50 employees"
good,It is a nice atmosphere where one can expand medical terminology knowledge and learn many different pharmaceutical medication and how they are used in the world.
good,"A typical day at my job can be very stressful and fun some days. I've learned a lot during my employment at CVS. The employees have taught me a lot from insurance,Tars, and dealing with rejections.I love my coworkers we are always laughing and I have built a bond with them outside of work. The hardest part of my job I would say is dealing with rude customers that get mad at you because their insurance wont cover their medications. I enjoy seeing my regular customers that come in every month and my co workers who seem to motivate me."
good,"Great work with teams, absolutely the  best place for learning SDLC processes and also to get better as a project manager who can see a project through initiation all the way to deployment and warranty"
good,Busy work place   Company is all about the numbers and growth is slow.  The most enjoyable part of my job is my love for my profession and what I learn from my patients  I am past the numbers game and more interested in the clinical part of my job
good,"Overall it's a good company to work for. The people are great and there is plenty of room for advancement. "
good,A typical day at work was pretty busy and everyday was a new learning experience. In my three years of being at that location we had 3 managers and all three of them were very helpful with anything. My co-workers were the best and we were more like a family rather than co-workers. The hardest part of my job would be on a monday or tuesday the busiest days and be short staffed.
good,"Decent job that can help you gain knowledge about medications. colleagues are great. The pay is decent. The only downside is that hours giving to the pharmacy, there's never enough hours for technicians and that can make the environment really stressful because we are low in staff in the busiest hours."
good,My peers were wonderful - easy to get along with and helpful. Learned quite a bit from all of them particularly AP and IT.  My position was managing the financial reporting of the DC inventories - the DC were also a pleasure to work with.
good,very accommodating for adjusting my hours to my school hours. would work for them again. company was fair. just wish they offer full time hours.
good,"A typical work day was busy, busy, busy. Between fielding up to 115 phone calls on a multi-lines phone and processing refills to sorting all the documents that came into the system via fax I was always on the go. I enjoyed the busy environment and learning what I am capable of when being the senior tech on staff. My co-workers were always fun and easy to get along with. I had a great team behind me and management that would listen if I had any concerns about what was needed. The hardest part for me was feeling like I was accomplishing enough and maintaining the level of productivity that I needed to. The most enjoyable part of my job was, in-fact, my co-workers; whenever I had a major life event [the birth of both my children] or a family member having surgery my team and my management were supportive. It's rare to have a team that are not only your co-workers but your friends."
good,Always something to do. Company has a great customer service rate and I really agree with the no smoking and help to quit.
good,"Not a very fast-paced environment. I learned very quickly about different types of customers and consumers, and how to approach and handle them all. The managers as well as supervisors are all very good at their jobs, and very approachable people. My co-workers are easy to get along with, and help time to fly by. The hardest part of the job is the dissatisfaction with not being able to provide customers with exactly what they need. On the other hand, the best part is being able to provide them with exactly with what they were looking for, or even lead them towards something they did not even expect, and help them to leave satisfied and pleased with their service."
good,"Answering incoming calls to refill prescriptions for patients"
good,I have learnt a lot about retail pharmacy. I love the fast pace but sometimes could be overwhelming. Hardest part is standing on feet and sometimes going without breaks. Also a lot dependent on the efficiency of all team members.
good,It was a great company to work for with great benefits. Again moving up as a pharmacy tech to a higher paying tech was very hard. Walgreens at that time only had one lead tech per store.
good,"CVS Pharmacy has instilled in me a great deal of knowledge. I have learned about different medications, what they are used for and how. I liked working at CVS because it stretched me. It was very fast passed and stressful at times. It was a good experience for me because everyone worked hard and well together.  It was definitely a team effort day in and day out to make sure everything got done. The most challenging part for me was the amount of stress that played into the job. At times we would have people come in and they would be miserable. Complaining about the time it took us to provide them their medicine, or how they were more important then another person.  There was always something that needed to be done, and you just had to push through and do the job well. Through this experience I have gained a higher tolerance for stress and faster work ethic."
good,loved going to work everyday enjoyed the everyday workout loading and unloading trucks and pallets. Working with my coworkers we gave one another the drive to push through the day never a dull moment.
good,"Fast paced environment , great customer service  needed  great team work with co-workers, being able to provide great customer service and quality to customers"
good,Overall it's a good company and the work is fast-paced. You don't get paid enough and hours are never stable whether full time or part time.
good,Went in and ran the register and had to clean the store and make it spotless. the management was not great and the other employees were not friendly.
good,"It was a good experience and enjoyable environment to work in. Many of the employees are friendly and team oriented that provide excellent service to the customers and also aide other coworkers with help in areas that they are not accustomed to working in as not properly trained and or not experienced in. "
good,"A typical day would consist of loading and unloading CVS stock,which was the hardest part of the job.I learned how to be a team player to organizing and managing the heavy lifting stock,to help the workflow and meet deadlines.My co workers was just as ambious to our work guidlines."
good,"Liked working with Hospice staff and resolving problems."
good,"I am Sterling Integrator Consultant, Work place with supportive management not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop"
good,"Mix iv meds, data entry. Detail oriented work environment. Professionally minded employees.Closed door pharmacy. Sterile environment.Casual dress attire."
good,"A typical day at work consists of many tasks including reaching out to patients regarding prescriptions,insurance claims and filling prescriptions in a timely manner. It takes effective team collaboration, empathy, compassion and diligence to help patients from all over the Dallas Fort Worth area with health conditions as different they are to truly make a difference every single day. "
good,"Fairly easy job. Just had to do what I was told and help customers to the best of my abilities. Co-workers and manager were quite friendly.  Some customers were difficult, but that's to be expected. All in all, I have very few complaints and enjoyed working there,"
good,A typical day consisted of assisting members with any issues they might have with getting medications. Also explaining to them what they can and can't get with the plan they have.
good,"It was an overall fun job. However, the management is awful. The job and the customers were fun. I would happily go back if I ever renewed my license."
good,Dealing with customers on a daily basis. Learning something new about retail and pharmaceuticals every day. Management made it fun and worthwhile to be there.
good,Communication through the warehouse on the supervisors end was very poor. The most enjoyable part of this job were the occasional job incentives given.
good,not a good place to work. Very demanding and want to steamroll on employees. No culture of serving employee yet. I highly recommend to find a good store before you work there
good,CVS HealthCare is the forerunner when it comes to health care domain. I count my experience working here as good. Thanks to its managers and colleagues for a healthy work environment.
good,"•	Assist in preparing and dispensing prescribed medications"
good,CVS is nice place to work . I like my benefits . the hours could be better. they have flexible schedules. the pharmacy is always busy
good,I loved my work schedule. I really don't have anything bad to say other than the credit system they use is not good. They do not understand that we have a family at home who depend on us.
good,"My co-workers were very nice to me, and always there to help. I loved coming in to work and being able to help people find what they came in for. If a customer left happy, I was happy. The hardest part of this job was having to multitask in a very fast work enviroment. There was only one shift supervisor and one cashier per shift, so things sometimes got a little out of control."
good,"Caremark, RX offers a fast paced environment, as well as provides great learning experiences.  Caremark assisted in my desires to become a Certified Pharmacy Technician."
good,"CVS is a very fast-paced environment.  Due to the size of the organization and constantly changing directives in order to meet the needs of clients, the ideal candidate will need to be able to adapt to constant changes with mounting pressure.  The rewards can be very good for those that strive in a high-stress, yet high-functional work environment."
good,CVS was a good place to work. It wasn't the cleanest but their pay was great. I learn how to input inventory information into their system and running order sheet for partners to selector for customers.
good,"1. SCRUM methodology is being implemented with during of sprints around 3 to 4 weeks."
good,"Systems are in place to improve pharmacy efficiency and minimize dispensing errors.  Profit is the companies priority, but ethical practices are still maintainted."
good,"There is not much to say. Worked for the summer, got paid. Stocked shelves, did inventory, and provided customer service."
good,"Very flexible scheduling for class/other time commitments. Friendly staff. Most patients/customers are regulars and very pleasant. Fast paced environment and there is never ""down time."""
good,"I learned a lot working there as far as how to run a business as well as how to develop a team. I had one of the most successful teams in the company ranking as the top store year over year in two separate markets, one in the Northeast one in the Southeast. I was a paragon winner with the company as well. My most recent DM was very supportive. I genuinely thank them for the opportunity and the knowledge that I acquired while working with them."
good,Its a great start for young people who are interested in retail and want to gain work experience. The manager will teach you everything you need to know about the store and how to provide excellent service to the customers.
good,"I worked in a call center, specifically clinical care. Everyone was very polite/courteous, and the knowledge and professionalism certainly showed in my coworkers and supervisors/management. Alas, it was only a temporary position."
good,"CVS Health was a good learning experience.  I learned to manage different personalities, different management skills and I learned that the Part D insurance company is always changing. There is no set work day.  There are always priorities and ""fires"" that need to be resolved in a short notice."
good,management reminds me of highschool. they like to talk about their subordinates to each other. people who have been there for years think they are invincible and start to pick with the newer employees.
good,"During my externship, I learned basic pharmacy procedures, i.e., answering multi-line phones, data entry of new Rx's, creating computerized patient profiles, communicated with doctors' offices and patients, Rx fills and refills, communicated with insurance companies for eligibility and prior authorizations, inventory procedures, followed all laws pertaining to HIPAA, Controlled & Scheduled Drugs, and cashiering."
good,overall it is a fun place to work i am also looking for more experience in the pharmacy setting the most enjoyable part of the job is the customers i love putting a smile on their faces
good,"enjoyed the employees and the customers you get to see everyday. have to love customer service to work here, very strictly oriented around it in every store"
good,Fast paced work place. Great job for learning about the pharmacy industry. The shifts fly by quickly. I learned every day I was there.
good,"CVS is a great company to work for. The initiative they are taking for better healthcare, they way they give back to the community and how they value their customers and employees is outstanding."
good,Was able to put a lot of my knowledge that I got from school into practice with Omnicare. Friendly management and great coworkers. Hours weren't great.
good,"Never a dull moment. There's always something to do, whether you take the few moment in between patients to catch up or clean up."
good,A typical day at work consisted of working the cash register and interacting with numerous customers. I was required to provide exemplary customer service and ensure that every customer was satisfied with his or her CVS experience. The Store Manager was really nice and he worked with everyone and helped them to get the hours that they wanted. Regional Manager was prejudice and only seemed to care about money. He appeared to be a nice guy but certain situations revealed his true colors. My co-workers were easy to get along with.
good,"A typical day in the pharmacy entailed dispensing over 300 prescriptions. In addition, I would call clinicians for refills and further clarification of prescriptions. This job allowed me to advance my time management skills and multi-tasking skills while working in part as a team. It allowed me to get clinical experience in a different aspect of healthcare."
good,Knowledgeable and helpful staff who put patients first. Excellent training programs have been put in place to ensure new hires will perform in an effective and efficient manner.
good,Great work place but never kept the same manager no more than two months. Loved all my tenants and enjoyed everyone of them.
good,"Keeping an eye on the bottom line in all the activities, and making the company financially successful. keeping the clients and employees happy.  employees have the freedom to take decisions per SOPs to bring positive outcomes."
good,"By far the best part about working for CVS is the customers that you can come into contact with. Some can just be a straight up job to be around. There are, however, those customers that know enough about the couponing system to know how to circumvent it. These customers can be so much ""fun"" to explain why they can't use a feminine wash coupon on a body wash product (did I say how fun this was). Once they leave without what they wanted, corporate for fear of losing a ""valued"" customer, they will quickly give out a gift card from some crazy amount, if you would have just honored the coupon in store, there would be a potential for that employee to be disciplined for coupon fraud. Much of the other operations work exactly like this ""damned if you do, damned if you don't""."
good,"co workers are great, benefits are good, room for growth, lots to do"
good,This job requires you to be a quick learner and a multitasking employee. The environment is fast paced. There is little room for error .
good,Good first job to learn how to manage people and check prescriptions. Good pay but not always the best hours. Depends on what district you are in.
good,"The Pharmacy solution is specifically engineered to meet Pharmacy's needs for high-performance products and services. These products and services comprise a single, integrated solution not available from a group of technology providers. The strategy integrates task-oriented workflow, medication therapy management (MTM) programs, centralized files, retail-based fulfillment and central fill, an electronic pharmacy record, and e-prescription technology."
good,"The main pharmacist is nice. Although, its a big pharmacy there is not enough workers, things are not always organized, and it can become very hectic. Customers are always grumpy because there medications are not ready. There are a ton of insurance issues and doctors offices don't always call back in time."
good,overall i enjoyed my time there no complaints...decent hours but not enough pay...understanding the medications was one of the good things about working there.
good,Friendly staff to work with. Always have a smile and willing to answer any question that is asked. If we don't know the answer we would research and call you back
good,"They are good to their employees and had a good facility. The dress code was casual and there was a relaxed atmosphere. However, nobody slacked off. I wish I was still with them but my position was eliminated."
good,Many opportunities of upward mobility and friendly working hours. Gained many skills which are re applicable both in formal training and on the job.
good,"This was an experience I will never forget. It taught me the teamwork is an important key to success. I also gained morals and important keys of life like respect, diligence, honesty, commitment."
good,all around good people and supervisors. typical day log in and be ready to assist member with their pharmacy questions. i was happiest to make the members aware of information on how to save money and an enjoyable experience with their insurance rep. me
good,I was able to take my experience in retail and apply it to running a store when the manager was not present. I was given the responsiblities of closing the store and making sure all inventory was accounted for.
good,"This was a great place to work for but one major issue was a lack of work.  This lack of available tasks to work on had me feeling I was under utilized.  An unfortunate thing was the work structure where although I spent some idle time identifying where certain issues existed in end of day unix scripts, I was not given opportunity to make the corrections."
good,"A typical day at work at CVS as a cashier entails plenty of customers from all walks of life coming into your store with different attitudes and personalities. Thankfully many people I've met have been either great and/or neutral. There are a few that will have a bad day that will come through, but if you play your cards right, they won't bother you once you have either resolved an issue that occurred while they were in the store or they have left. "
good,"Worked as a Vendor Project Manager along with few other Vendor group, learnt the success of collaborative working. Good place to work."
good,"Sitting, staying logged into phone and computer. Learned to flip pages faster and where to look in work instruction to find information. Colleagues are awesome! Hardest part-reaching senior team. Best part-speaking with the patients."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with customers."
good,A typical day is the early morning shift and you are very familiar task. The management team is very active and the co- workers are hands off. The hardest part of the job is long nights.
good,"Good company, good place to learn multiple skills, good support system from management and co-workers, good connection with community and what the company stands for."
good,"always fast paced and constantly moving"
good,CVS Health is a progressive and exciting work environment with many opportunities. Every day presents new challenges and opportunities.  Employees are rewarded for the hard work.  Great team environment.
good,"love the teamwork and assistance from team members. Very well educated in prescription insurance.  The hardest part of the job is all of the different systems, some of which didn't always work."
good,"CVS Health recognizes Core Values. I was fortunate to have a director that supported my growth both individually and in my various roles within Specialty Reimbursement. CVS Health offers continuous training opportunities, which is a win, win for all! Due to restructuring I'm no longer with the company."
good,CVS Pharmacy allowed me to work in a professional and productive environment. I learned to manage my time wisely and produce efficient results.
good,I had a great time working there.  The supervisors are great.  The most enjoyable part is the people I worked with.  Typical day at work is checking your inbox to see if there are patients to enroll for a specific type of medication.
good,"A typical day at work is reviewing appeals sent to CVSCaremark  from Maximus, a federal department under Medicare Part D prescriptions.  We gather all information that we (Caremark) have in regard to the case, and any reasoning as to why payment for this medication was denied. Then we send it out to Maximus for their determination. This is all done through computer access. "
good,"Very prouctive fast paced work environment. Billing, filling, and point of sale experience. Knowledgeable staff always willing to help."
good,"500 prescriptions a day, lots of laughs and hard work. The best crew I probably could have worked with.  Cohesiveness between store front and pharmacy. A good place to learn patience with people."
good,This job can be faced paced and stressful at times but it can also be rewarding. Being able to work as a team is critical to make it through the hectic days.
good,"quick meeting as soon as your on the floor where you're told where the daily quotas are and need to be. You get to work independently while still working together, as the whole production line has to work as a unit.  You know whats expected from you and you safely and accurately get it done. this is not the environment for pregnancy hormones and morning sickness too many spills, smells and lifting."
good,A typical day at work usually begins with a crazy amount of escripts all seemingly submitted at once. Lunch is an extremely needed break. The day goes by quite fast and by the end of it you realize that you have helped at least one patient.
good,"Reviewed private pay patient billing statements for correct and accurate charges."
good,"Throughout my work experiences in the health care field, I have learned how to effectively communicate with a wide variety of people and help them on a path to better health."
good,"When working at Caremark it was always busy, in regards to how many people would call in to order their medication. It was really busy around the holidays and summertime due to vacations."
good,"Supervised staff of 5 comprised of Pharmacist, Pharmacy Intern, 2 Pharmacy Technicians, and a Cashier. Provided operational oversight for all functions, processes, and procedures of the pharmacy."
good,There is always something new to learn each day. Everyday is unpredicatabel. I come to build relationships with regular customers and help as much as I can.
good,"I enjoyed working with the beneficiaries, and management at the time was very helpful, knowledgeable. Fun place to be!"
good,"Working as an Adjudication Specialist was very fulfilling.  Quality and turn time matters, especially when dealing with third party insurance claims."
good,"CVS is a good place to learn starting out as a fresh technician, you get hands on training and online modules. Most pharmacists are very helpful and also veteran technicians to help you catch on. At times you can have a lot to juggle and it can be very fast paced"
good,Fast paced and challenging work environment. Demanding but good customer service practices. Customer based care is exercised.
good,"There was always something to do whether it was just a daily operations or something extra you could do to make the store look and run better. All of my coworkers were easy to get along with and we all had a strong sense of what it meant to work as a team,"
good,"A typical day has many different specialty therapies and ability to learn at a very high pace.  Management is really nice and encouraging, co-workers are in the same grind, the hardest part is the uncertainty of stable business.  The most enjoyable is the company gym, Starbucks, and a decent cafeteria."
good,A pleasure to work for as it allowed me to help seniors get medication needed for daily function. Long-term meds. were provided in 90 day Rx which cost less and gave more range to the patient.
good,Great opportunity to be exposed to a retail pharmacy setting. The company allows you to improve your business skills and customer interaction.
good,"•	Processing, labeling and prioritizing throughout prescription processing "
good,The work is always interesting and the staff is friendly. If I could change anything it would the break room. It's just a little hole in the wall.
good,I met a lot of new people and made new friends easily. I loved my job packing/shipping in the dot com department. I lost 60 pounds just by doing my job. The picking and keeping up individual rate was an issue for me in the picking because of the automated system Jennifer. I had a quicker pick rate when I was paper picking.
good,"This can be a stressful place to work, and they will always be needing you to stay for overtime. However, they like to say thank you with little gifts and offerings."
good,"Very intense and fast paced work place. Requires knowledge and understanding of pharmacy terms and policies. Best job to deal with different customers and work on a extremely fast pace. Dealing with customers, patients, doctors, vendors and insurance companies all at one time."
good,"Good Company if you're there as scheduled, but don't get sick unless you can go to work sick. The Company is short on pay and advancement. Not too many places to advance to."
good,"I work in a great environment with wonderful co-workers. I learn new ways to maneuver through accounts everyday. I love having a set work schedule. The company has hard working supervisors, who are willing to help at anytime"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was just knowing that I was responsible for making my clients happy and healthy assisting with getting them they're medication.
good,"Management was great, it was a good place to gain some work experience."
good,"I ran the cash register and stocked, I also did customer service. Can't say I really learned anything new, since I have done this type of work before. My co-workers was awesome. The hardest part of the job wasn't the job it self, it was trying to work two jobs. The most enjoyable was getting to see people I had not seen since high school."
good,"I loved almost every part of my job during my time there. I loved everything from the clients and their pets, to my co-workers, my uniform, the longer lunchtimes and the different experiences that came with each day. I felt very proud and honoured to work there for the first six months of my employment and felt I represented the company's ethics perfectly. I built long-lasting friendships with my co-workers and clients, and enjoyed coming into work every day with a big smile on my face. Myself and my colleagues had a lot trouble keeping up with the changes after times became stressful in the company, which made our superiors within the branch unbearably snappy and unacceptably disrespectful to employees lower than them on the career ladder, creating a rift within the dynamics as well as mass upset to all involved. A vast majority of the employees of CVS, from the nurses to the managers, are amazing people and very considerate to your needs, but a few of the Heads appeared to continue using their higher roles to bully and belittle you, and spoke to you like you were a stupid infant (even though you weren't at all at fault - not that anyone ever deserves to be treated in such a way, especially not in the workplace) after things appeared to look ""better"" in the company. There was plenty of gossip and patronising involved. Support during the harder times was non-existent and when workers repeatedly reported the problems with certain members of staff we were made to feel disbelieved and ignored, which I believe to be totally unacceptable, especially when higher up staff were patted"
good,"Working for Cvs was a great experience. I learned how to deal with angry customers, I learned to be helpful and calm. I also learned how to work as a team, if a coworker called out I was always willing to come in to help out my team. I also learned to get along with everyone even if we did not see eye to eye. My most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and seeing their smiling faces and knowing I did my job. I would say the hardest part of my job was angry customers, and the long hours, and lack of help on days we really needed it."
good,"My first job, I loved this place, management was so so, co- workers were amazing, I enjoyed my job in general I love being nice and neat for work it made me feel important and professional."

Management was always present if you had questions.Co-workers were polite and friendly, everyone was eager to work to get the job done.The hardest part of the day would be if a tote jam occurred and stopped the belt from moving totes would be placed on the floor.The most enjoyable part to the job would be the co-workers and all the special events that were held throughout the year for employee appreciation."
good,"Over the last several years worked within the Enterprise Data Warehouse space building business intelligent data for downstream business reporting."
good,"Type up prescriptions, fill prescriptions, make customer calls, process insurance, maintain patient profiles, and manage inventory."
good,I would log into the system and review patient records and information. I learned how to be organized and efficient. Management was very hands on and helpful with training and on into the actual work. Co-workers were all very friendly and helpful with welcoming me into the workplace. The hardest part of the job was maintaining all of the records for each patient. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning something new and getting to work in a corporate atmosphere.
good,Very dynamic work environment.  Enjoyable people to work with in a very fast paced environment.
good,A typical day at work is Great. I love what i do and my coworkers are great also.
good,"My duties at CVS health alternate between a position in the pharmacy as a pharmacy tech, and a position in the retail portion of the store, as a store associate. When I work in the pharmacy, a typical day of work is never predictable. Duties fluctuate depending on the different workstations I might be assigned to, and workstations alternate throughout the shift. I am often covering the pick-up workstation, where I find and ring out patients prescriptions, in addition to working at production in between customers, which entails counting pills and the first stage of filling prescriptions for the pharmacist. There is also the drop off workstation, where I take and enter prescriptions into the RX database for the pharmacist. This is the most demanding workstation, as many unpredictable snags can come up in trying to fill patients prescriptions through insurance, and thus at times requires extra phone work and coordination with insurance companies, as well as prioritizing these rejections among other tasks. There are always questions and issues and lots of trouble shooting. It can be very chaotic, but also exciting."
good,"energetic, and fast paces environment. patient focused.Lkevereage your leadership and team to make the greatest outcomes!!"
good,"Working at CVS Pharmacy in the pharmacy taught me a great deal about customer service, office experience, data entry, accounts payable and receivable, and loss prevention. I learned how to keep calm during high volume in person customer service as well as handling patient and doctor phone calls."
good,"CVS sometimes does really well at choosing who runs the pharmacy. When you have a good pharmacist that person is a true leader and makes you want to come to work to be pushed, and the numbers show that you like being there. Then there's the polar opposite (micromanaging, nagging, complaining) this pharmacist works you to the ground and your still at 20 pages in each Que! So I say I say it depends on who's managing"
good,"I was lucky to start with Caremark back in the 90's, when it was part of Baxter.  As the company grew, I was able to learn the business to a level that made advancement a natural part of my progression."
good,They are an average company to work for. It is a retail business.
good,"I've been working at CVS for 6 years and I like the direction that the company is going in with the stop smoking campaign however store management is incompetent and only actually do any real work when they know the district manager or higher are visiting the store. They laugh, joke and sit in the office all day and only come when you need assistance after you call them a half dozen times. I have had 4 different managers and about 10 different people have been fired for stealing merchandise or time clock fraud. If you are thinking about working at CVS here's some advice.... Come 10 minutes early, clock in, smile and greet customers, do your job, don't STEAL (They will catch you), and don't socialize with the staff to much and go home. I promise if you take my advice you will enjoy it,."
good,"Same thing, not enough money for the hours I worked, some member of management some times gave attitude, until we talk to the store manager."
good,The most rewarding part of the job is getting candidates hired for some of the most difficult positions to fill within the entire organization. I really enjoy working with my team members.

good,"productive and professional environment, had fun although company pushed sales on CSR when we had a sales department"
good,received inbound calls: scheduled patient medication shipment orders; updated patient profile with any changes; enrolled new patients into database; outbound calls: confirmed shipment orders; coworkers were like extended family members; I learned to stay professional even while on the call with a difficult caller; the hardest part of the job was speaking with a difficult caller; the most enjoyable part of the job was after speaking with a difficult caller before the call ended it turned into a positive experience

good,My typical day consisted of filling prescriptions and answering the phones. I've learned how to refill a patient's prescription and learned what some other medications are used for. The people I worked with were very friendly and helpful to whatever I needed assistance with. The hardest part was not being able to answer a customer's question.
good,awesome i loved this place very nice and friendly staff and everyday was great
good,"Good Pay"
good,"A typical day at work was data entry, filing and telephone. I learned to assist where I was needed, outside of my main job duties, which was filing. Management was nice.  My co-workers were respectful. The hardest part of the job was being eliminated when the company was bought out. The most enjoyable part the respect of my co-workers, professional and God fearing environment."
good,I have worked in retail most of my life.  Gotta say that CVS is much better to work with vs. their competitor (which I've worked for 5 yrs).
good,"great co workers "
good,Co-workers were friendly and enjoyable to be around. Patient care is always the most important aspect of work.
good,"Over the years I have grown with and produced consistent results for CVS Pharmacy. I have opened 2 new stores, transformed troubled stores and run high volume stores. I have trained a number of assistant managers; many of whom have gone on to be successful managers."
good,I learned how to bill for insurance and type prescriptions.
good,"Organized workstation"
good,CVS Pharmacy was a nice place to work.  The staffing could have been improved.
good,One of the best companies in Rhode Island to work for. Lots of opportunity!
good,At CVS I developed stronger customer service skills and pharmacy skills.
good,"As a manager it is key to set the tone and right environment to get excellent production from employees. Communication is important when discussing tasks with employees.  "
good,my main goals where to help coustomers find items and medication that they needed
good,"Cool place to work. As a Pharmacy Tech I assisted customers will prescription refills, handling specialty medications orders and shipping.  I also provided thorough inventory ordering assistance for all distributing CVS pharmacies."
good,I didn't receive proper training and had to learn everything on my own.  There were too many lead technicians and everybody wanted to be boss. Hours weren't enough to take care of my home.
good,A good company to work for with flexible schedules but need better onsite management
good,"Customer needed and appreciated our help."
good,"Perform essential administrative and labor management duties"
good,Pretty decent company to work for. Pay is not the greatest and hours are not flexible at all
good,"Having great colleagues reduced the stress and tasks to be carried out throughout the day. Customer service is very important as it adds onto how well the pharmacy is doing. When there is a rush of customers, getting things done within the promised time could be challenging."
good,I didn't get very dependable hours at this place witch made it had to make a living.
good,We were a very busy Pharmacy. Never seemed to have enough help. When someone called in there were times no one would come in to help. I enjoyed helping the customers. I learned that once you reach a certain age there is no chance for advancement. The hardest part of the job was when we were short of help and very busy trying to get every thing done that needed to be done. I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers.
good,Over all it was a different pharmacy experience being that it was clinical. I enjoyed it but I use to the fast pace of moving around like in a hospital setting.
good,"I loved working here. When working here you have goals and expectations that you need to meet but with the help of other co workers that are upbeat and willing to get things done on time your experience will be a breeze. The hardest part of this job occurs when the supplies you need is limited. Besides that, my experience was enjoyable, the people were professional fun to be around, and I truly looked forward to going to work each day."
good,"Great company, love the benefits and the people there are awesome. The subject matter is challenging but in a good way."
good,"A typical day at CVS included various simple tasks. There are usually two people on duty (3 if you include the manager). One employee stays behind the register and the other remains on ""the floor"". Now the employee working on the floor has a bit more freedom than employee #2 who is restricted within the confines of behind the register land. They get to walk around and make sure customers find everything they need, and on occasion they spend their time counting and managing inventory in the stockroom. As a customer service worker it is always stressed to greet every customer and ring up their items politely and efficiently. Working in the front of the store means you're in charge of the photo equipment as well. We would process people's rolls of film from their disposable cameras. This involved a big hunky, loud machine which we were also responsible for cleaning. Other duties included stocking the shelves behind the register when we had free time, cigarettes, nicotine gum, lighters, etc."
good,Working at CVS had the pluses of working with the public and helping the people around you. Hardest part of the job was dealing with someone the people that wanted the product they wanted/needed right then and if you couldn't get it to them they would cause a scene. Most enjoyable part is seeing the gratification on a customers face once you finished helping them out.
good,"A typical day at work is back to back phone calls with members calling in with regards to their medication.  I have learned to be compassionate and to relay reliable expectations to the mbrs, bc some medications are life sustaining medications.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to sometimes breathe between calls. The most enjoyable part of my job is making members smile through the phone especially when they came in with a negative attitude, the ability to turn a frown upside down."
good,Continuous self-education on pharmaceutical procedures and counseling patients on proper usage for medications
good,I am an Lead Technician. I help along with the Pharmacist to ensure our customers are well token care of in an timely manner.
good,"Starting as a technician and transitioning into intern to a staff pharmacist and finally into pharmacy manager has been a very rewarding road. I learned from managing inventory, counseling patients, compounding, working in high stress situations, and coping with challenges. The most challenging aspect of work is building a team that can work as a team and are willing to take ownership of their workplace. Business metrics are always measured by customer satisfaction and I have excelled in providing my patients with easy to understand answers and properly take their medications. To be appreciated for what I do is the most enjoyable part of this job. When the patient leaves with a smile, I realize that I did the best I could and I did it right."
good,"My typical day at CVS was an experience for me. I met lots of different people from all over the world. When I clock in I always prepared myself for anything that was about to come, verifying all customers insurance, on the phone dispensing medication and so much more pharmacy work. I've had some co workers that didn't work as a team and some days there would be stressful customers that want their medications right away and it just makes the day even longer and hectic. I must say I enjoyed this job because no matter what I was able to help all customers with all their needs. my most enjoyable part of the job was just me being able to help."
good,"I have learned many things since I started to work at Omnicare. I have learned how to review orders and drug interactions for accurary. I have also learned how to process and fill IV medications. Since I have started my job, I have learned about perpetual inventory of controlled substances and compounding of non sterile medications."
good,"Very busy, especially on delivery day. I learned that if you work hard you will be successful. The management is good. some of the co-workers is trying to out smart you so they will do less work. The hardest part of the job is closing. the most enjoyable part of the job is when I am in the cashier."
good,"I provided excellent customer service, managed inventory and increased sales."
good,I love this place and helping to process orders for specialty medication.

good,"I really liked that I had the opportunity to learn Oracle and People Soft. These are two programs that I have always wanted learn. I found they were both user friendly and easy to learn.  "
good,"A typical day at CVS consisted of extensive customer service, filling prescriptions, data entry of new prescriptions, and calling insurance companies. I learned how to communicate with people from all over the world, to be patient. I had a good relationship with my bosses as well co-workers. The hardest part of the job was to how to handle difficult patients. The most enjoyable part of my job was our customers."
good,Working in the pharmacy definitely promotes a good team environment as you will be working at one station while your co-workers will be working at other stations to ultimately get customers their medication. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people i get to work with while the hardest part of the job is working through insurance issues that may arise
good,I did not enjoy working for them.  Management was not the best.
good,"A great experience working with pharmacists and learning so much about different drugs, side effects, interactions, etc. Just knowing the majority of my drugs is so helpful in a health care career.

good,"CVS is a great place to begin your career by working in the store.  Gain enough knowledge and begin looking to growing within the company by positioning yourself in other areas. "
good,"Working with CVS is different every day. The basic opening shift would consist of cash verification, opening the store, ensuring floor/product is stocked. Customer service is the number one key to your success with this company. If you are unable to work well with people, customers and staff alike, then this company is not for you."
good,"	Provide customer service to internal departments, clients, providers and members. "

good,"Typical day- Working call Ques"
good,"A typical day consists of preparing patients prescriptions in a timely and efficient manner. This job taught me valuable skills including customer service and satisfaction, inventory management, and how to work with and communicate with other professionals in my field for example doctors and nurses. I was fortunate enough to work with a group of highly talented and passionate people and I think this made for a better and more productive work environment."

good,"Once I began I always started with the apearence of the store. Next was checking voicemail and making list of all returned calls that needed to be made that day. Customers could come in and recvieve a skin analysis where i would take pictures of their skin and sit down with them in a very clean setting and work out their individual skin regimes beginning with cleanse, tone, moisturize. Customers were educated on each product that was best for them and client cards were made so that I could always follow up with them in a timley manner. I had a very communicative relationship with management and always a positive experience with coworkers seeing as most of the time they would call on myself for product knowlege. The hardest part of this job was also the most enjoyable. The hard part was setting sales goals to make budget, but in the end when they were usually met, or sales contests were won, that is what made the job so fun- setting goals and using marketing as well as event planning to execute the most sales."
good,"I enjoy the work I do at Caremark, I like being able to help patients with any questions or concerns they have regarding their medications. My day consists of processing prescriptions orders by doctors/patients and making sure they get out in a timely fashion. I've learned how a pharmacy works and prescriptions and their uses. I became familiar with different insurances and their policies."
good,"Job was kind of plain, but one got used to it. The work schedule was pretty decent and the work environment very relaxed. Co-workers were good, no complaints there."
good,love working with customers and working in the warehouse. i also like unloading the trucks to make sure everything goes where it belongs
good,"I would either work first or second shift and a typical day at work for me would be to run a crew of both front store and pharmacy, money handling, customer service and working with others. I learned quite a bit from this job, I now feel like I can do everything that is put in front of me at CVS. The hardest part of the job would have to be solving different problems that are put in front of you on the spot. You always have to be on your toes and know what to do next whenever something comes up. The most enjoyable part of my job would be interacting with others whether it be customers or my employees."

good,A wonderful place to work.  A lot of great people with a lot of seniority and wisdom.
good,"This job was a fast-paced mail order pharmacy which required heavy data entry of prescriptions and a large volume of phone calls. There is a high turnover due to a stressful workload, but it was a steady, well-known company with continued growth."
good,I like my job but they don't pay enough.  I love the people I work with and that we are constantly busy. But when customers complain because we need extra help CVS takes it out on us rather than seeing we are slammed  busy and need more workers during certain times of the day
good,A typical day would be helping customers find items they are looking for along with assisting with any other questions they may have. Taking coupons and ringing customers up for their purchases. Helping maintain the cleanliness of the store.

good,"A typical day at work may have me setting an add in the store, running a register, and recovering inventory. My manager is very enjoyable and treats her employees fairly and with kindness and my co-workers are very helpful and do their jobs to the best of their ability. The hardest part of this job is having to set the ads. Setting store advertisements is not necessarily as hard as it is painstaking. There is a lot of inventory that goes on sale every week, but despite the mass of inventory I still enjoy setting advertisements because it can give me a little while to collect my thoughts on a long day. The most enjoyable part of my day is interacting with all the customers. I am very much a people person and enjoy helping everyone."

good,"I love everything about being a pharmacy technician and I loved working at CVS but the location I worked was very busy so at times it could be stressful and some of my co-workers were hard to work with at times but I loved it. The enjoyed doing it all. The hardest part of the job was the patients being overly harsh to you at times but everybody is human and when you are in this kind of work, it does comes with the job."
good,"CVS is a great place to work. I learned how to delevlop films. I had some of the best coworkers and managers ever. They made sure we played as a team.,"
good,"I really enjoyed the work, people, and job.  I learned a lot more about the different aspects of construction work.  I took this with me to the next job.  The guys that worked for us was a great bunch."
good,Overall the store is a good work place. its a great way to work on your costumer service skills . My reason for that is alot of different cultures and race come along and all do not treat you with respect. I try my best to not let a costumer ruin my day so i keep a smile on my face and deliver my undivided attention regardless. CVS is a well organized store that settle for nothing but the best
good,"Pharmacy has grown into a huge business, which at times is not as personal as in my earlier days as a pharmacist"
good,"The CVS store that I worked at was an extremely busy 24 hour store in the heart of Los Angles. But I loved every minute of it because it taught be how to be disciplined, have good work ethics and be able to handle a large volume store and still be among the top of my co-workers in customer survey satisfaction.

good,"A typical day at my job it is base on customer service. I have been working for Cvs for almost 4 years and I can not complaint about how many good things I learned every day. I can handle any type of customer because I learned to be this type of person. I like to work with my co-worker because we enjoy our job and be work as family. One of the hardest part of my job is to not be able to help y customers because their insures or doctors are not on Cvs record. However, the most enjoyable moment is when my customer make me feel that I do a great job every day."
good,I completed many very interesting projects. I met many great people and learned a lot from them.
good,Good career opportunity. We took a product related company and created more of a services business model. We found someone who wanted to acquire the company.
good,"Three way invoicing was fun to learn. I also did expense reports for the sale rep. "
good,I really did have a amazing opportunity to work with such good and hardworking individuals.
good,"This would be a great company to work for if you were single had no friends, family or social life. I personally loved the customers and the whole details of the job, the benefits were great. BUT if you EVER needed a day off for anything (funeral, doctor, illness) ANYTHING, sorry but they will not allow you to take the time off because no one is willing to work for you. The worst part is corporate saying they are willing to help fix the issue and them doing NOTHING about it. Overall it is a good job if you have nothing to do, if you have a life and kids and things going on I would say that this isn't for you. They are not flexible or understanding at ALL."
good,I work in the pharmacy and my day is easy-going on some days but other days it has its rush. I learned that we are a major part of taking care of the people who need their medications. We're the contact between the patients and the doctor offices. I think the management is alright meaning people should have their reviews done when there suppose to instead of 6 months after the fact. I love working with my co-workers their amazing. The hardest part of my job is when a patient/customer is upset that their doctor haven't sent over the prescription to be filled. The most enjoyable part about my job is making a difference and helping those who needs us daily.
good,i work 15 -25 hours at omnicare. i fill in where needed. i enjoy   the pharmacy work and the interactions with fellow workers.i

As a whole I thoroughly enjoyed my job and the daily tasks that were involved in this position."
good,"A typical day at CVS pharmacy consists of opening up to a line of patients waiting to get their prescriptions filled.  That continues all day until closing as the pharmacy is in a busy location.  Management at my store is great to work with.  Very punctual in answering questions and great attitude and friendly personality.  Co-workers are what keeps spirits high when the day gets rough.  Everyone works well together to get the tasks completed, with few exceptions.  The hardest part of my job is keeping a system to get a prescription filled at our busiest time of the day.  But, having a great staff is the best part of the job because we all rely on one another and help one another."

I got along with all my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with a specific number of presciptions that needed entered.  The most enjoyable part was seeing my friends everyday.
good,My first job after graduating. I was a great learning experience my co-workers where great everyone got along very well. I loved doing customer service.
good,"A typical day at work is constantly answering phone calls from patients and doctors offices to fill prescriptions as well as refilling prescriptions, Also, preparing medications in the most convenient time for patients. The job can be some what frustrated due to the high rate of patients that come to our store to get there medication, leading to some inpatient people as well as some giving us attitudes if something wasn't filled when they came to pick up their fill. I always learn that our patients are our everyday value to make satisfied. Patience is a lead role at my job as well as customer service."

good,"Working at CVS has provided me with a certain perspective on retail work that I never got while working at Gamestop all those years. The customer base fluctuates with the given time of day, meaning you must become more patient and understanding as the day goes on. Some people are there just to grab a couple things on the way to a local sports event, while others are shopping for a majority of their weekly groceries. Every customer is unique and has a story to tell. "

good,this was a job i loved going to

There is some data entry required for this job. The ability to multitask while keeping the focus on the main project is a must. The pharmacist is always there to lend a hand when needed. We all work together as a team to fill the customers requests in a timely manner. The hardest part of this job as with any that deal with the public would be the angry customers, but you just learn to smile and help them the best you can. I would have to say that my coworkers are very fun to be around and make the day fly by."

I did have friendly and supportive co-workers. The difficult part of my job, I would say that when I had to deal with a sick patients when they had no refills available. Difficult, not because it was hard for me to handle the situation, but it was emotionally overwhelmed. I used to feel really bad for the sick patients in the beginning, but later on I got used to it."

good,"It was great working for CVS/Caremark. After all I spent close to 14 years there. But, we always felt that the job security was missing. And, at the end, they moved the back end operation to another state."
good,"Working at CVS has been a wonderful learning experience for me. I have learned a lot, and have become extremely responsible through my management position. I gained phenomenal customer service skills and interpersonal skills from working one on one with customers helping to resolve any issue that may have occured.

good,It was a good atmosphere to work in the people were friendly and we helped each other as it was needed. Management was pretty good it provided us with amble about of time to find jobs when our jobs were being terminated. They had a company come in for job fairs/to do resumes.

good,it just all depends on location. not to trust management. i loved my springfield location where im at now no body trust me.
good,"A typical day at work is crazy busy! I love not knowing what to expect, with each new day. Situations arise constantly that require research and quick response time, which makes it very exciting and far from boring! I truly enjoy resolving issues for my clients."
good,Its a good place to start as far as warehouse jobs go. Nothing to great to talk about.
good,"Very hectic & fast paced work environment, tempermental clintel, the co-workers make the best part of the day. I've learned a lot about insurances and how the work.

good,"Its is a smaller pharmacy, so it does not get to crazy. Good environment to learn the different medicines"
good,Management and co-workers depended on me alot and it was a great feeling. We all worked well together.
good,The system was smooth overall. Sometimes would get saturated if worker took off or was sick and back up staff was not there.
good,A good place to work but they need to be more sensitive to there employees needs.
good,"Every day is different, staffing patients to agencies can be a challengene, with insurance and quality care of the patient."
good,"I started off as a Merchandiser and was promoted to a Supervisor after my work ethic was recognized. Being a Supervisor has increased my skills such as time management, decision making, and complex problem solving. I appreciate the opportunity to advance such skills."

good,After five years with the company I have to state they were a joy to work with as a company. I had no issues with my supervisors or upper management. It's a great place to work.. if you can deal with the customers.
good,Good Place to work.there is always some thing to learn.
good,A typical day at work goes as follows:
good,"Omnicare was re-organizing their management structure when the economy started to fall apart. They got too big, too soon in Maine and they had several lay-offs and since I was the last one hired for my specific job, I was the first one laid-off. There were three of us. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in the back, helping fill the prescriptions, with fun co-workers and the radio on. We laughed and joked when we worked together."
good,"Start work early with a status meeting, move on to review claims,end the day with report of claims worked."
good,What i like the most about this job were the peolpe i worked with. I was also able to assist members with thier concerns and i tried my best to my ability and traning to assist them if i wasnt able i would ensure i transferred to the right department. The hardest part of the job for me was hearing the frustration in the members voice if i wasnt able to help them or we werent. That or they were given the run around and all they want is someone to listen to them and help them. I would always try but sadly there were time when i would try to go out of my way when i would be told that wasnt our job.
good,"verify insurance data, whether medicare, medicaid, or private insurance. Do some billing. Admit patients into computer and demographic info. Enjoy the job. Keeps me busy but need better pay."

good,"competitive pay, decent benefits, large corporation, good co-workers"
good,"competitive pay, decent benefits, parent company sold the division,"
good,typical work day recieving calls for members inquiring about drug coverage. the hardest part of job is telling a member drugs are not covered by plan due to medicare law .
good,CVS is a fast pace environment place. you will always get that morning rush customers come and going to work. Special evening time customers get off from work and pick up their medicine or do photo films for them. Part of the day get busy and slow at CVS.
good,"Great place to learn but very busy. So, it's not the place for you if you're a slacker. It just needs to pay better."
good,"my job as an extership student was to pull the drugs back in the shelf, pull, fill, and from time to time type in prescribing into the computer. my co-worker where rally helpful they helped me as much as they can and thought me as much as they could to help me out. the hardest thing off the job was to stand for a long period off time, but after a while you just get used to it and it doesn't seem like a chore. the extership i enjoyed most about the extership where the people they just made the working environment workable. was really nice doing my extership there but know i want to expand my knowledge and find a stable job i the pharmacy field"
good,"started at 7am filling prescription orders pulling meds for the orders, first run goes out by 8:30- 9 am.... get ready for the next order to run around noon.. filled and refilled e-kits for the nursing homes and iv kits. The hardest part of the job is making sure that you have pulled the right med for the right patient in a timely fashion,the part of the job that i love the most was doing the E-Kits and IV Kits.. and the shift ended at 4pm..."
good,"A typical day we fill at least 250 prescriptions, resolve multiple insurance rejections, and have very familiar interactions with the customers. I have learned SIG codes, how to resolve varying insurance rejections, condor codes. I enjoy my coworkers we try to make our workplace enjoyable to come to. I enjoy all the responsibility that comes with the job."
good,This was my 1st job and I worked here for 3years. I really enjoyed it . I was able to learn new tasks and Begin supervisor training.
good,It was good when I just started since I was still in high school and the schedules are very flexible. Overall not to bad but it gets pretty annoying fast. Especially if you like doing new things like me.
good,"A typical day consists of hard work and motivation. the hands on experience is the best part.

I also learned how to check in deliveries and how to check in vendors. I had a great relationship with my fellow team members.
good,"Work is fulfilling as you get to meet and regularly serve families of people in need. Management is supportive although corporate is always trying to push numbers, average pay for the role has decreased over time."
good,I am very happy as an employee with this company. Unfortunately I've had to move out of town so will more than likely have to make a career change. Management very caring!
good,"CVS Health is a fun and fast paced environment to work in.  Positive communication with customers and other coworkers are crucial to the job, as well as completing job tasks timely and properly."
good,I got to learn first hand what needed to be done to help customers on a regular bases. Whether it be checking them out or helping them find what they needed in the store.
good,If you don’t hit the rate or doesn’t look like you’re improving they will let you go instead of helping you and give you tips on how to meet your rates. You pretty much have to figure it out on your own and by the time you figure it out it might be to late
good,i like working at cvs. i feel i don’t get paid exactly enough for the job i do. schedules are not as flexible in pharmacy. other than that i like my job.
good,It's a great work place if you like working for a small company. It's not a hard job and they do offer flexibility for there employees. It's an easy job to handle.
good,"this is a very physical job, constantly moving product throughout the store,  the projects are always time consuming with little time to do the work while waiting on customers at the same, always have to stop what you are doing to wait on customers. I am not saying that that shouldn't happen customers are why you are there, but those work on store displays or new set ups should have enough back up to cover the customers. Pay is minimum wage even for shift managers."
good,You will be on your feet and working. Not a bad job. Older employees can be catty. If you pick up on tasks fast you will do very well and more than likely be the pharm managers favorite.
good,"It's a fine job, best thing about it would probably be the starting pay. Managers can be good or bad, that's just luck unfortunately. Some benefits and options are ok. Not much room for advancement."
good,"CVSHEALTH is a very stable company and depending on the department, there is opportunity to grow and move up. The company is very diverse and inclusive where all employees are respected."
good,"Once you've been hired you will get the chance to adopt easily , and become productive and eager to learn new training methods a step at a time. You will become more evolved once you start to seek opportunities and given challenges. Take everything you learned to motivate others, use to your advantage to move up the ladder."
good,The day was smooth. And I did not have an issue with the company. Neat and quite environment. The leads spoke well and it was a okay place to work at.
good,"Clock in,  sit at a computer. Enter or correct prescriptions,  take 2 breaks and a lunch. Work 40 hours plus overtime. Have paid time off,  health benefits"
good,"The location I worked at was a slower CVS and was enjoyable for most of the time, but still tedious because CVS doesn't allocate enough hours for their people to get paid. If you are a full time employee you are guaranteed at minimum 30 hours and can pick up shifts at other stores, but those looking for 40 hours may want to find a job that can provide the full 40. I loved my management in respects to pharmacy, but the District Managers are only worried about numbers, they do not appreciate their pharmacist or their technicians. Most of the pharmacist I have worked with really care about their technicians and people, but the District managers could careless. In the time I have worked at CVS, there has been a total of 2 District Managers that understood and really took the time to listen to their technicians and pharmacist instead of being number crunchers."
good,"honestly, if people were nice and patient, the job wouldn't be so bad. also, if management was more understanding about the fact that we cannot control most things due to patient ratings and the natural instinct for people who had a inferior experience to be more likely to comment."
good,This job was fun because of the people working with me. But the whole job in total was boring because all the tasks I was asked to do were tedious and should not have been done as much as I was made to do.
good,"Not a bad experience, room to grow though, advancement and employment options are not clearly posted so current employees can seem them. Would be nice to have this in the breakroom."
good,"Fast Paced, detail oriented workplace, inbound call center with high call volume and ever expanding workload. High stress workload and work culture environment."
good,"I believe working for CVS is a good stepping stone, especially for those going to college to become a pharmacist. It allows you to gain experience in a high stress environment. However, I do not see this company being a long term career choice for those who are only technicians. The medical benefits aren’t that great and if you advance quickly in the company, you’ll be capped at a certain wage for the reminder of your career."
good,My complaint would be that you don't have to know much to be promoted and there isn't any true teamwork. More training is needed for shift supervisors and cashiers.
good,"The employees there are sweet in their own way. If your a hands on type of person and quick on your feet, I would recommend this job for you. It's mostly fast pace and no room for attitude unless it's positive. Smile it's free and contagious."
good,Workplace is productive. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to create a relationship with patients. I learned how to multitask and create an enjoyable work environment.
good,You must have the ability to put the customer first and get your work done. In our store we also had a fun time while getting things done. I didn't mind work there at all. I can only speak on my store.
good,Love the management and team when I was employed. They're super efficient and perform better than most other CVS locations I've been in contact with. Shuonan is the best.
good,"Working at CVS is better than most jobs in my area, the pay is great and the flexibility is amazing. Granted I have never worked any where else besides CVS, I have worked here for 2+ years and find it very difficult to find any other job I would want to work at. I was promoted in under a year, and have growth opportunities to work in the pharmacy. Overall even though the job can get stressful there are no retail jobs without it’s own set of flaws. CVS provides opportunities that make working in retail worth the hassle."
good,"I have mixed objectives about my review as CVS at the time I worked there had not paid very well. I believe now that has changed and they have increased the pay range. I was hired on part time and never was offered full time for the 2 plus years I worked there, so I never reaped the companies benefits. I think that in some stores this can be a desirable place to work if you like a fast paced environment in Pharmacy."
good,CVS is a great company to grow with. I started off as a cashier with minimum responsibilities and worked my way up to a shift supervisor position within a year. Sometimes the workload can be overwhelming but it has definitely taught me the dedication you need to have in a workplace sometimes and how to give good customer service
good,Retail is always challenging. Moreso when employees call out of work and there is no coverage plan in place. However it does make you a stronger employee to be able to juggle all the responsibilities you are required to do and keep the customers satisfied.
good,It was great working at cvs my 6 years but there wasn’t any room for growth and because of certain things that came apon it was time for me to move on
good,"Though you never know what day you have off, you could easily get your work done and mingle with your fellow middle class. weekdays were fun to have off cause you could be more productive. Though good luck getting the steady hours."
good,"Basically a typical day at work was very fast paced which encourages one to understand any patient's needs. I've learned to appropriately understand and accommodate the patient's needs in a timely manner while showing urgency to their requests. Managent was professional in accommodating employee's needs. The hardest part of the job was getting used to the work flow, while the easiest part was the week after beginning."
good,It seems my last two experiences with CVS is management issues.   They feel entitled and cause a caustic work environment that we take care of.   The structure and policies are in place it is the hiring.
good,"I've worked for CVS Pharmacy as a shift supervisor for almost 4 years now and I've really enjoyed it! Just like most workplaces, it has its ups & downs, but overall I have loved working for CVS! I've made lots of friends that are now like family and I've learned so much. Very thankful for my time here but I feel it's time for a change."
good,"I have very good experience working in CVS. I worked as a pl/sql ODI developer, We used extract data from EBS and populate data to dataware house and reporting team used to build reports."
good,"A typical day would be your on your feet for your entire shift. Assisting the pharmacist with helping customers. There’s always something new to learn at the job with constant updates to the systems. If you like a fast pace job this is the job for you. There is never a dull moment. It can be extremely busy at times, which makes the day fly by."
good,"At cvs I didn’t have any good mangers , the hours were getting cut which was unfair to all the part time employees. And they never offer you a higher job you must apply yourself"
good,"Cvs is absolutely a great place to work if it’s your first time getting a job or a job in retail. It honestly all comes down to coworkers, managers and I’ll be honest... customers. The problem they have is not enough man power to get everything done. More payroll would make this job the best. It is certainly a fast paced setting in most stores atleast during the day and mid day. I’ve worked in all types of cvs’ and they all have their challenges. The best thing in my opinion about cvs is that they are usually flexible with schedule and if you need hours just call around to other Locations. The holiday pay is my personal favorite though. If you are full time most of the holidays you get paid time and a half or you get your 8 hours of holiday pay. Makes for an awesome pay check."
good,"I’ve worked at cvs since for so long, the function of my position, is easily perfomed. It is a fast paced environment that taught me how to multi-task"
good,If you had the right supervisor everything was super relaxed and enjoyable. If you did not then your time there could have been difficult. I was lucky enough to have both. Before I left I had one of the bad supervisors. Other than that the environment as a whole was very relaxed and they did lots of on site activities to appreciate their employees.
good,"The people that work this call center are very uplifting , they are also extremely helpful if you reach out. At the end of the day you feel as if you really have help and made a difference."
good,"Relaxed environment, friendly coworkers with an alright manager. Sometimes she would be very uptight when tasks would already be completed. Overall a good workplace."
good,Fast page depending on the location of the store you worked at. Dependent on the team you was working with if it was going to be a smooth shift. Overall its ok
good,CVS isn't as bad as many make it seem. Everyone has their good and bad days. Every day is a new day and you learn a lot on the way like multitasking..
good,"Was an Awesome Company to work for at the Beginning of my Career,but as the years went by,the store count kept rising,the culture of the Company changed for the worse,hours cut, benefits cut, pay cut, etc."
good,"A typical day would consist of checking in the daily medication order and stocking the shelves, then run new prescription labels for meds we were short of the day before. Throughout the day I would assist the techs with filling scripts and restocking refilled cards for pick and stick. At the end of the day when most rx's had been filled I would order any needed medications."
good,"While working at CVS I gained great customer service, problem solving, cash management, inventory management, merchandising, follow loss prevention tactics, abide hazardous waste regulations, vendor affiliations, scheduling, store-ordering operations, basic medical terminology"
good,management was great... had busy days but was still ok. never had a problem when needed to request off.. understanding friendly environment taught us very thouroughly what needed to be learned
good,It is a little challenging when you start to work there but soon you will get use to it. It is very hard to handle upset customers. You can be able to help customers find what they are looking for so that their needs are satisfied.
good,"The call center was extremely stressful. The management would not allow you to hang up on a customer who was cursing at you.  You had to make up time if you were going to be absent.  You had to take a lot of calls and you were not allowed to talk back to a customer if they were insulting you. Overall, it was a fast pace and stressful environment.  Wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."
good,"great job, lots of work to be completed. the job did have some great things and some bad things. The job did teach you well and what to do. This job taught me how to manage my time well and work hard."
good,"Overall, CVS is a decent company to work for but I can say they seem to care more about their customers than their employees since the merge with Aetna. They continue to cut hours as the customer/patient volume increases due to flu season and normal drug maintenance. They also set unrealistic standards and exceptions for production and service although they cut employee hours."
good,I went work at client CVS from my vendor PAC. CVS work culture is good and the team I worked with was great. I wish I could stay there longer and be able to provide more service
good,"Worked as a Pharmacy Tech for 3 years, it was a great way to push myself forward and gain knowledge in the field of medicine. Management was never consistent but I guess that was different for each location. Working with various interns and pharmacists increased my knowledge and drive to help better people and pursue a career in the medical field. I would highly recommend started here if you are unsure if you want to pursue a job in medicine or pharmaceuticals. The retail aspect also gives you the people skills needed in every day life. The job can be hard depending on which location you work at as some are busy while others are less busy."
good,"Usually and standardized and easy job, learned how to deal with customers and their insurance and prescription needs, can be very dull and boring unless working with good co-workers."
good,a typical day at the pharmacy consists of a lot of team work and how hard the day is going to be depends upon how efficiently the team works altogether.
good,"Usually very busy days, minimal staff to reduce operating cost. Good compensation for pharmacists to make up for the stress, and tech wage are increasing, however still lower than average."
good,"CVS Health can be very challenging for some people. Being one of the largest companies in America offers opportunity for growth and yet if you are not careful you can get pigeon-holed into a particular job or field. The pay and benefits seem comparable to other US corporations. Big is not always better because the company does not always move quickly."
good,"Flex time is becoming more of the norm. However, it can be difficult to advance,complex industry, busy and slow growth. It can be stressful at times especially during welcome season."
good,"Worked average of 30-35 insurance claims per day dealing with follow ups, denials and payments. Constantly work with supervisors to resolve insurances claims. Special projects assigned and expected to be completed within certain deadlines."
good,"Good client and long duration projects but work load is more. Client does not use many industry standard tools, they go with the existing tools and are reluctant to change."
good,It is a valuable place to work and i would recommend it to others.  A typical work day is on the phone consistently assisting customers with prescriptions and their insurance benefits.
good,"I absolutely love working wsleith my staff, and love most of the customers. however company it's self has became impossible to work for, we are not given the labor hours to do our jobs, and they are falling behind more and more each day."
good,"Working as a Pharmacy Tech the environment can be very fast pace, the atmosphere is willing to help others in need of their medicine, giving others a helping hand, supporting and being open to customers who are sick."
good,"The day starts off with vacuuming the store, making sure the aisles were clear and everything was stocked. I learned how to sign someone up for a cvs care card. The management was very considerate, he made sure if you needed that day off he would cover it. The culture was very relaxed and clean. There wasn't a hard part of the job, it was pretty straight forward. The most enjoyable part of the job was changing discounted labels because it took the whole day and it was something to keep you busy."
good,"CVS is not the worst to work for - trust me, i've worked for far worse - they are however a large company an things fall through the cracks. I think you just notice them more at CVS. "
good,"It was nice but I went to #1 district in the store (with gossipy, annoying coworkers who would pick on me) then went to a horrible, dirty one in DC, who AWFUL people to work with; work was always busy, nice benefits"
good,"I truly enjoyed working with the employees at the job, but I enjoyed even more working from home and having the same opportunities for advancement in the workplace whether it was working in the office or from home."
good,"Very laid back environment with minimal restrictions. Prescription benefits is not fully understood by members, which makes the job enjoyable, in educating on the benefit. The hardest part was working weekends, which affected work and life balance."
good,"Wasnt treated like a contract worker.  Was given IT tasks to do, and was left alone."
good,"The training process is very unclear, and not much progress is made in a timely manner."
good,Very fast paced environment and at times chaotic.  Very demanding mentally and physically.  Have to be willing to brush off verbal abuse from customers
good,"I enjoy working as CVS Health as my manager promotes work life balance.  The benefits are competitive, and include an employee stock purchase plan and CVS store discounts."
good,The hardest part of the job was having to take on several tasks at one time. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting several different people and being able to help our customers. I learned that you have to give your best no matter what.
good,"It's the kind of job you would expect from retail. Your responsibilities are to ring at the register most of the day, you also are required to process damaged goods and do returns. Keeping the front of the store clean and uncluttered also helps. Dusting, vacuuming, facing the store, taking out the trash at night. I've definitely acquired excellent customer service skills from the time I've been there. The management team is good but I feel they get overwhelmed very easily which is unavoidable I feel due to the policies of the company. We are in the center of town so we definitely play a part of the town culture and have customers of all ages. The hardest part of my job personally is honestly just the repetitiveness of it. No particular part of the job is difficult, but it becomes tedious and feels like you put the work in for it to just come undone overnight. The enjoyable part of the job is really just the staff that work there. I feel fortunate that we have such a good team, If we didn't, I probably would have left a long time ago."
good,CVS is a great company to work for. Flexible hours and I am able to spend time with my family also. It is a very relaxed work atmosphere and I work with a great group of people.
good,Cvs is a good company to get to experience many did roles. Which means training in a lot of areas to further your career. I do recommend. Positive vibes and team work is always there.
good,I  worked  there  27  years  and  advanced  to  position of  training manager  I enjoyed  most of  my  there   interaction  with  pharmicists was  difficult
good,There was always something to be done or get done. Never ran out of tasks to perform like stocking and cleaning and always had customers that you could help.
good,It was a great learning experience to work at CVS.  I got lots of opportunities to improve and advance in my career.  It is quite a fast pace organization.
good,Depending on where you are in the scope of your job title it can be a good or bad experience. I’ve been in just about every position on the specialty pharmacy side other than management. The management? It’s absolutely horrible and the company hires from the outside to fill positions that others deserve from within. I got let go by a manager that was hired on at the same time when I got promoted into one of the corporate positions. She had a complete lack of direction as a manager and was dumb as rocks; going through the same on site training courses I could have done a better job managing than her. I guess it all depends where you are placed and the people you work with. Overall I can say it wasn’t a bad experience for the most part
good,I had just received my Pharmacy Technician certificate and worked at CVS as an intern in hopes of get hired at least part time. It was my first time working in that kind of environment so it was fun and I learned a lot.
good,Fast paced yet fun position. Alot of learning and test to continue taking given the position.  Overall a good place to work. Downfall is traveling to different stores for training.
good,"The patients were the best part of my job at my location. My pharmacy manger sucked. She was a egomaniac, micromanager, sociopath with a narcissistic edge."
good,"Clock in at the beginning of shift, follow each set break during the day, be available to take calls consistently.  Certainly teaches you how to become accountable and to be on time.  I would not call it high paced, but you will be on calls regularly.  Once you have a strong understanding and knowledge of the job duties you will be performing and programs you will be operating, it makes the job a lot easier when it comes to keeping calm and collected during each call.  Hardest part of the job is the unpredictability of the members calling in.  But the best part of the job is the satisfaction of helping those members and serving their needs by the time you finish the call."
good,"It encouraged me to pursue my career in pharmacy. As a technician, my tasks were to dispense medications, ordering and stocking medications, filling prescriptions, delivering medications to patients’ homes, as well as assisting the pharmacist with translating the medications into Arabic to non-English speakers. At CVS Pharmacy I was able to further my capability to interact and solve any issues with the insurance companies, as well as with healthcare professionals. I was able to adapt to new work flow, RxConnect computer system, and suppliers for the company."
good,Been with the company for 2 years. Wish they let me keep my position when I  move out of the area since i am capable or have the ability to work from home.
good,CVS is a decent company to work for. Very liberal and fairly caring to its' employees. Great discounts. The most difficult part of the job was the inconsistent schedule. Working pharmacy is a much better oppertunity than front end. Graveyard shifts are difficult and not worth it.
good,"I loved working at CVS distribution at first, then after a few weeks if being there, it started to get kind of Rocky, but I made the of the situation and got my work done."
good,CVS is okay if you have open availability. If you're a college student you will never be full time here. If you have a life outside of CVS you will never be full time here.
good,It was a job where I felt like I could just get by I wanted to be appreciated for the time worked there but as time passed my moral started to decline. More work was demanded from me but not more pay
good,This was a busy and competitive pharmacy to work for. They were definitely concerned more about how much money they made and less about taking care of customers and patients.
good,"I worked there when they were Revco, so I was there during transition.  I enjoyed working there never boring. At that time we were able to work and help the pharmacy."
good,"I loved working with CVS other then not getting enough time with my family. I was always working when my husband was home and he was working when I was not. Then I had to work every weekend from Friday nights, doubles every Saturday and then open to close Sunday. I just got burned out having to work all weekend every weekend. Not a bad place to work with great pay and you can move up in the company if you want to."
good,Really nice owners. Good place to learn and understand Independent  Pharmacy Practice. Good place to work and learn. Good culture. Great owners. Great place to work
good,Good company with professional people to work with.  Very busy with limited personnel.  They do need to hire more personnel to better accomodate the employees.
good,"There was none stop updates on regulations and tests to complete and always reflected badly.  At same time, you had to continue your in bound calls..."
good,"My experience at CVS Pharmacy may have been limited since I worked the graveyard shift.  It was slow paced and quite different than the other shifts.  "
good,I worked in the Pharmacy so my typical day was alot different than those that worked the front.  I had to have training and keep up with insurance changes as well. There where alot of customer questions and filling customer prescriptions.  Sometimes it is non-stop and other times you may have long periods of down time.
good,"There are a lot of things to do everyday but the company doesn't have enough technicians' . The pharmacy staffs (pharmacists and technicians) are nice. of course, sometimes you have to deal with some crazy people."
good,"Very fast paced and often short staffed in pharmacy. Must be able to multi task customers, insurance companies, phone lines, and still pay close attention to the medication you are filling."
good,company that has become healthcare leader in the industry and continues to improve to become the standard for retail pharmacy in the nation with its primary focus on healthy living
good,"Fast paced environment, good conversation with customers, great communication with managers. If you can't handle a fast paced environment and/or high pressure than this job is probably not for you."
good,I enjoyed working at CVS for 2 years. I really liked my coworkers although management could benefit from listening to the workers more often and work on communicating with the call center reps also. Over all great place to work with great hours but the work place drama and management could use more attention from the higher ups to improve productivity from the workers.
good,"I really like CVS health, it is a good company with a solid benefits program. I would really like to see more focus on Engagement of the employees and to show the value of their employees."
good,Very long hours required.  Strong company culture with mission statements followed.    This company has great benefits.  The company values their employees and is strong on communication.
good,This was my first every job and it helped me grow as a person. Teaching me so much each day. Helping patients live a better life and learning about pharmacology in general.
good,"fair work place good pay and they offer double time for working holidays, but they need more security in the stores it has very high theft. Sometimes the upselling of product gets tedious"
good,"A day at work, is drive thru, front, RTS, and terrible hours. You will go here and we are exposed to go to a different station every few hours and yet we stay at the same place, most of the time. If you want like to stay at one spot, then this is the job for you. You are exposed to run your station as well as make courteous calls to see if someone needs something filled, or to ask if they want to enroll in auto refill or script sink. You are also exposed to ask at the registers when you ring them out. So basically the same person is gonna get asked multiple times, even they may have said no to the person who called them."
good,"This is a good place to work.  The paid training was extensive and we always had someone there to answer questions and help as we needed."
good,great experience where i meet nice people who tough me a lot and i was really blessed to have this experience.I recommend everybody to join this company because it is a good start if you want a career
good,I don't mind the work. It is very easy and get paid a fair amount for the type of job and what your expected to do. Has a lot of locations and are able to work at other stores. Like that its a big company not a franchise or anything like that. I personally don't get a lot of hours but hopefully that will change since I am still on the newer side.
good,It's a great place to work as long as you can meet goals every week and keep off mgmts radar very fast paced be prepared to go home early a lot and then work your butt off around the holidays
good,"Loved the job, however position was eliminated due to lack of work. A typical day included some emails from home, preparation before entering a facility, having entrance conference with DNS, administrator, Medication regimen review, drug storage audits, and then printing reports and meeting with administration on exit"
good,"Doing great things to make healthcare accessible for everyone. CEO is always looking ahead to make CVS true customer focused. Very high paced, great place to drive results."
good,"Typical day at work was super busy and dealing with patients who were either unhappy or impatient occurred more often that I'd like. However, I was ale to channel my experiences toward positive feedback from management and the supporting staff."
good,"8 he's work day, learned various clients, manager not always available onsite, hardest part of job is not being able to get the help needed. Fixing customers issues."
good,"The company was great to work for. This last year though, they got rid of the assistant manager position company wide. That, I feel, was the downside of the company."
good,"The daily routine is to make sure all components are turned on.  The outside garbage gets taken out and goes into the dumpster,  The store is swept with a broom n dust pan.  I greet the customers as they come in.  They do their shopping, when done, they come to the register and get checked out.  At this time we converse with them and make sure the shopping experience was a great one."
good,I love my job but I am looking to expand my knowledge and experiences. I dont have much to say about CVS. Its a job and i enjoy working there but its not enough pay for me and my son.
good,The job it self was fun. The turn over rate with management for not meeting a certain quota every month was high. I didnt feel valued as much as i should have after working there 9 years 11 months I was only making 11 dollars. 10 cent raises wasnt paying the bills
good,"I had a pleasant time working for CVS. They were always flexible with my hours and gave plenty of training and support."
good,I loved my job but would have been better if they didn’t have favorites. Over all was good and learned a lot. They did pay for my license which was awesome.
good,Most days are very busy. You need to have mutitask skills and friendly customer attitude. Requires memorizing skills and organized work skills. I really enjoyed that they were willing to allow training on the job experience.
good,"Filled medication orders per prescription. Ordered and stocked supplies. Input patient and insurance information into data system. Input prescribed information into system for submission to insurance."
good,"Not sure if it is still called cvs Caremark its been forever since I was there and the place was okay, definite had there favorites, and computer, and laid me off cause they lost a major company at tHAT TIME"
good,"It’s been awhile since I worked at CVS health. A lot has changed, during my time I enjoyed until a lot of changes where taking place. Mangers where amazing, the store I was located at was extremely busy and we had numours amounts of Pharmacist that came and left. It was a busy store, I still keep contact with certain employees and it has not changed."
good,"A lot of things to learn as a customer service representative, but they offer training and a lot of resources to help you. Hardest part is remembering all the company policies. Typical day at work is like your average call center, 8 hour shift. They have a cafeteria. Nice office, and great coworkers."
good,"The CVS Pharmacy I work will over work you. Its understaff, and you do not get any breaks. I don't see any chance of moving up in this company. I would say it is a good company to start off with but not anything long term."
good,It was a good secure job but the pay was not what I expected. The hours are always changing so you don't have consistency in your life. Some of the staff are still stuck in the old sav-on way which made the job a little difficult.
good,"Absolutely loved working for this company when I started, however new owners and upper management decisions turned a great job into a stressful year long situation. Position was relocated after many date changes. Benefits were okay however health insurance cost for a family was outrageous. The job itself was very stress free and focused on building and maintaining a good relationship with the customers. Which isn't something you see much anymore, having your ""regulars"" really created a good work environment when as a customer they knew who they were going to speak with and didn't get the run around. Like I said it was a great job that I wish I could've maintained.  However relocation wasn't an option nor worth the hassle."
good,"Great place to work steady employment"
good,"CVS Distribution is a fast paced working enviroment with high expectations.   If you are not able to meet the expectations in the alotted time, they do not provide addtional training, they walk you out."
good,"This company was great when I started, very good management, you worked hard but you knew what you worked for and the results needed to achieve goals.  It has drastically changed, the management has now come from another company, the environment is one of a company in decline.  It seems like the leadership is searching under every rock for a penny.  Currently they are looking to send a lot of functions over seas just to save money and reduce headcount.  We now are even cutting back on cleaning services in the building that is how bad it is."
good,I made lots of friends with my co workers and my supervisor and everyone there was very helpful. But sometimes people would call out and it would be hard to maintain the store with few people.
good,fast paced work.  able to work different areas of filling medications.  had to fill high number of prescriptions every day.  management always involved with the workers
good,"Every day I answer calls to help members with their prescription benefits. Most members are unhappy and need someone to explain what is happening. A lot of the time I am able to calm people down, while other times people can not accept the facts of their insurance plans. I didn't like that the overtime was so overpowering that I didn't have my usual days off to manage my life, like paying bills and car repairs."
good,"Very productive and busy workplace. Learned new thing at work everyday. Love the way customers service in CVS, patient and very helpful to customers. Always tried to saved money from third party for patients."
good,"My Managers are  great, Its just Corporate and how they cut hours everywhere, So we dont even have that many workers so it hard to take off or call out, or even make a living and  it seems like its so much work to do, with not enough Pay and it takes so long to get a raise but the type of work itself not bad"
good,working at Caremark was very stressful because of the amount of calls taken every day and most of the calls were upset members. I learned a lot about medicare programs. Management was okay.The hardest part of the job was learning the medicare programs available.
good,Very fast paced facility. Management needs more experience dealing with employee needs. Co-workers easy to work with. Free bagel day on Thursdays. Do not expect time off for a long time.
good,A typical day at CVS Health is continuous computer usage to process claims quickly and accurately. I learned various new programs and Medicare laws. The management was good at letting thing be known at the last minute for overtime and changes to processes that have been in effect. The culture was good a lot of friendly people. The hardest part of the job is trying to be perfect for certain clients and adhere to the rigorous requirements of the busy season. The most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers and the fact that you interacted with good members that were happy that you have went above and beyond to service their Medicare needs.
good,Stable employment. Enjoyed working there. hours was consistant. Want to get rehired again. Completed tasks as required. excelled in helping customers and did assigned tasks on pro-active basis.
good,It's a nice environment to work in and my fellow employees were very helpful. The manager's were very understanding and can help your schedule be very flexible. Faily speaking CVS is a positive environment.
good,A day in the life of my job consists of picking store orders accurately and efficiently. I am a trainer and enjoy training new hires.. the most enjoyable thing about this job is that you get paid to work out...
good,It is a good place to work if you like a decent paced atmosphere because it isn’t fast paced and you tipically  don’t do a lot of stressful work unless your the overnight stocker
good,"Need to be always on your toes ready to help a customer because customer service is key. Keep the pace with incoming prescriptions, answer phones and monitor inventory."
good,"Restock,"
good,Good place to start a career in healthcare. regional management can be iffy. Hours are not too consistent but they do a great job working around schedules
good,Great place to work for a beginning pharmacy technician. I learned a lot and found this to be a great opportunity to work with and for people who really knew what they were doing and were willing to teach me.
good,"every store manager and all the staff can be so different in each store, some are like families and others are strictly work ethic relationships. i recommend finding a store that fits you and DO NOT GET HIRED TO A UNION STORE. it is not effective for technician to pay union dues."
good,"Job tasks were very time intensive, fast paced and not very flexible.  Work challenges were very rewarding, but could be difficult depending on the number of outside resources needed to fulfill the task.  Learned so much about the retail business and running operational support to all 1700 plus locations to help them achieve maximum results."
good,Only worked part-time but employees were nice. Supervisors were nice but the company operated with outdated systems and practices. High turnover and a lot of stress on pharmacists.
good,"Was pretty straight forward. I worked with good people and it gave me the opportunity become a CPHT.  Management was alright, I didn't have any problems with them while there."
good,"Most of the managers i had didn't have their heart in their job, and made it difficult to keep things on track, left alot on our shoulders. That being said, my crew always took care of it, we were awesome. the benefits are good, the pay can be too."
good,"I received inbound calls from providers and/or their staff requesting authorization for medications that has rejected at the pharmacy when the client tried to fill. "
good,"Where to start ... I have worked in about 14 different CVS branches across 3 different states. Some stores have been excellent, some have been thrown to the wolves and left to die. Management has been equally variable from incompetent to incredibly competent."
good,Cvs is a great Company To Work For The benefits are great if you’re under the right manager Advancement Shouldn’t be a problem and sometime it is. I would say it’s a great first time job
good,"Seems the work was never ending, getting things done internally for the client was very difficult to much red tape and clients moved often, just when I would clean up one I would get another one. Tired of the clean up and having to get acclimated to new clients personality and them getting to know how I work."
good,Not enough pay and no room for advancement. Everyone has the same jobs and just goes from department to department. The building needs a cleaning as there is a bug problem. Employees are very dirty in the restroom and lunch room area.
good,"Even though it was an internship, I treated it like it was the first real job that I had. I learned how to run a register and how to interact with customers. The workplace was very focused and moved according to customer flow and was well managed."
good,"This is a fast paced job.  Great people to work with."
good,"During my time as a data entry technician at Caremark it was a pay for performance setting.  The faster and more accurate you were, the more you got paid.  I did very well there."
good,"I got great experience at Omnicare. You have experience in long term care, assisted living, and have the opportunity to work on call, and will be able to interact with nursing and prescribers on a daily basis, In addition, you will get experience in IV admixtures and non sterile compounding. You manage a large technical staff and will keep busy,"
good,"Advancement opportunities do not come often, I would like to continue growing with a company, if not Omnicare, then possibly somewhere else.  I did come into the position at entry level and worked my way up and have been stagnant for some time."
good,"Fast pace working environment . "
good,"na Get a lot of awards, but also get dumped faster.. "
good,Si me parece buen lugar trabajo actual mente en este sitio
good,"Great environment where people are friendly and helpful.  decent rate of pay and good benefits.  Relocation is doable, just make sure it is the right fit for you."
good,"Its a high paced work place, very customer oriented and working as a team is nonnegotiable. Pay is not fair or reasonable for the work you put in. Hours are never guaranteed, and On The Job training takes up to two months to complete before working in your home-store."
good,"Competitive pay and benefits; however, frequent changes of management, sometimes for the worse. Overall, a great company and plenty of advancement opportunities."
good,All in all CVS is like every otjer3 company. I believe they treat you fair & expect the best from their workers.  If you want a job where you learn how to assist customers in saving money then CVS is the right fit.
good,"This is a very fast pace location, you stay busy all the time, making your shift go by really fast. Most of the customers are friendly.  I know many of the customers by name and are able to tell you about their personal life."
good,The corporation is fine to work for.  I have never had an issue during my time of employment. Again the schedules are flexible.  Over the years of being employed there I met some very good people.
good,"Fast paced working area"
good,"Retail plus pharmacy is not for everyone, saw people come and go over the years but I experienced and learned many things as I work for the company. Benefits are good but the pay is ""okay"" could've been better. The work place is really challenging and fast paced. I work overnight so staying awake is always hard. Other than the regular tasks of stocking shelves and helping customers the job is pretty easy."
good,"Okay place to work, hours were long because work had to be completed before shift was over, so teamwork was a must. Management tracked workers by computer throughout the shift, weren't too hands on. Overtime was often and pay was okay could have been a little higher."
good,"I started working at CVS last year, with high hopes of some form of advancement. However, after a few months I slowly realized that this job did not have any advancement whats"
good,There are various opportunities to learn different aspects of the organization.  They encourage cross training and increase/improving skills. Project management skills are highly desired.
good,"good place to work for, although I found co workers not very sociable. The work environment is very balanced and my manager was very helpful during the entire time I spent there"
good,It was a peaceful work environment.it was easy and fast paced. The people their were nice and it was a friendly work environment. I enjoyed being there.
good,"Assists customer at counter, receives written prescriptions for pharmacist, retrieves filled prescriptions. Rings up orders. Receives payment, make change, processes checks, credit and debit charges. Provides prompt and courteous customer service. Answers phones, directs members to product. Assists Pharmacist in updating patient profile and entering prescription information into the pharmacy computer to extent allowable by State Law. Preserves patient confidentiality."
good,We have a good team working. My schedule is available. I have a good communication with my management team. I enjoy helping customers. I have learned so much i have a lot more confidence on myself.
good,I generally enjoyed working for CVS. My only issue was I capped at advancement. They discontinued merit raises. Some management were great new management were not.
good,"The manager i had wasnt the best, but the job itself was all that bad. I didnt like being the only supervisor willing to do actual work. But the other employees and customers were great."
good,"Must have great customer service skills and patience. Depending on store size may have a hectic working environment. Must keep updated on training and and any changes that take place with policies and technology. It is what you make of it; if you come in on time time, do hark work, help your peers, stay later to help, and cover shifts it will be noticed. The downside is that sometimes they cut hours which makes it hard for stores to keep up with daily operations with limited staff."
good,"Unfortunately, the way many large businesses with low education employees now work is that the cream of the crop that work the hardest and learn the quickest tend to leave after they see an opportunity elsewhere. CVS is no different. Luckily, the Pharmacist in Charge at this location is an amazing advocate for his employees and you can learn a lot there as a technician with no previous experience."
good,"I had quit cvs couple months ago due to management, unorganized, treat their employees like slaves! This is not a Family oriented job , it's a business!!!"
good,"Good overall job pharm managers sweet..bit of favoritism played...some get away with everything...lack 9f advancement even when interest is expressed"
good,It’s the pharmacy business so it’s very busy. I worked at the new been location across from the hospital so it kept you on your toes. The management at the time could have been better but it was an awesome learning experience.
good,"my typical day consist of filling prescriptions, calling doctors, answering patients questions and concerns,counseling, immunizations, patient care calls."
good,"Good Company and would work for them again. Just not the specific store I was in. Good benefits, and advancement opportunities. I learned a lot as a new Tech, but they are not too patient and does not want to train new people."
good,This company is ok. Looking to move on for more of a challenge. Very cooperate driven with very little training before new process are rolled out which can be frustrating.
good,Did prior authorization took incoming calls from doctors nurses and pharmacy. Processed there request and approve or deny the request.  People there where willing to help which included management
good,"The CVS I started working for a little over 3 years ago ins't the same as it is today, no more a one call resolution, patients are just a number anymore."
good,"a friendly environment all around. customers and coworkers both were enoyable. coworkers worked together well as a team, everyone got along and learned things consistently. if one of us knew something that another didnt, we would teach them & help them. every now and again you get your upset customers and some you can never seem to please; aside from that it is a good job to work at & learn from, my only complaint is more on the corporate side, cutting pharmacy hours & didnt post raises in a timely fashion at all. wouldnt even give you back pay in their error."
good,A typical day is a continuous flow of work with customer satisfaction as your reward. Being able to assist people in their day to day health plan feels great. Although most of my coworkers are very young they can be a pleasure to work with. I have learned so much since my first day concerning the ins and outs of the industry that I find myself always looking for new things to learn. If you are not a thick skinned person I don't recommend this line of work for you.
good,"CVS provide me hands on the Insurance side of Healthcare quickly. It also taught me the value of healthcare on the front with patients. Not just a Chain Pharmacy, but a place where the community trust they will get the care required with confidential, professional and safety a priority."
good,"Great work with employees,not so good management,but always have great to work with patients,with colleagues,and the most priority to work in medical field ,work and type priscriptions in the systom, and also bless for work with medicines so basically work in medical field."
good,Generally treated with respect.  Work is interesting and important.  Stressful at times.  Salary and benefits are about average.  Understaffed making more work load than is necessary.
good,"Place is ok for beginner pharm techs that that want to leave retail behind and focus on account management and working with other people in healthcare, not just patients."
good,CVS is very focused on customer service. I learned that greeting a customer as soon as they walk into the building can have a very positive affect on the customers shopping experience and will determine if the customer will be a one time shopper or a frequent shopper. The management group was very fair and understanding. the most enjoyable part of working at CVS was talking with the customers. The hardest part was trying to promote to a upper position.
good,"Prescriptions always come in, pharmacist can be needy during immediate deliveries, and technicians seem to do most of the work while managements sets ideas."
good,Overall everyday was highly busy always something to do. Generally worked very long hours enjoyed the fact everyone worked together as a team. Staff was pleasant
good,The position was good if you were looking for something that was a part time position and you were in school.  the hours were typical evenings and not what i was iso.
good,This job is where all my training has come from. I learned a lot about customers and how to accommodate their needs properly. I loved having regulars who loved seeing me as much as I them.
good,All I have to say is challenging. But a good experience for my past employment. They got me trained and kept me working for them after training. Sorry I had to move were their was no CVS.
good,"A typical day on the job has you working with customers both cashing them out and helping them find the appropriate products.  We were also responsible for organizing the store on a daily basis.  At times we need to check in new products and returns."
good,"I didn't really have an issue working there. My supervisors that I worked with were very nice, and I even got to hang out with some of them out side of work. The pharmacy was extra friendly and awesome. I felt like everyone there was family and could talk to them to just about anything. Only issue I really had was staying until 10 at night and the pay being not the great. But it was still fun to come too. It's a hit or miss. My friend worked at another CVS and it was absolute bull and madness in her store, but my store was laid back and nice."
good,"Depending on the location, CVS is always busy. The front and the Pharmacy are two completely different worlds. Great customer service is a must, and going the extra mile for our customers."
good,"productive"
good,"My time at CVS was great. My manager was kind and on top of business, my coworkers were like family, and we kept the store clean and welcome. My only issue was when my former manager left, they threw a new male manager into the store that was all women without training him in any way. He was not a people person and he slowly drove away all the previous employees in that particular store, including me. However i do believe this was an isolated incident and general management is good."
good,Like working and greeting customers. This was a pretty cool job because helping people fincastle what they need and want helps me help the community..
good,"You're typical work day would consist of dealing with insurance companies, patients and doctors offices. You learn a wealth of knowledge about insurance and healthcare overall. You develop great relationships with patients."
good,I really enjoyed my job at CVS. You would get to know almost all of the regulars my first name. Very friendly environment to work in. Other employees were nice and pretty good at their job. This would be a good job for someone who is still in school or just graduated.
good,I liked working at CVS when I had no desire to move up. Now I have been there for going on four years and have applied for three different management training positions and have not been selected for any of them. I am very qualified so I wasn't sure what the issue is. Work in a smaller CVS store if you would like more opportunities to move up. I worked in moderately sized stores. The management is great though. I only ever had one issue when I requested time off at the same time another employee did. They also cook for us on truck days.
good,"Overall a good place to work. Very fast-paced. Multitasking is a must, but it makes for a quick shift. The only stressful part is the large amount of constant sales."
good,"this was a chain with only one thing in mind,having more business and locations that Walgreens.often had to listen to the store management telling me how to work a pharmacy"
good,"CVS Pharmacy/Health gave me the opportunity to explore community pharmacy and the role that pharmacists play in such a setting. "
good,"Well some of them, the ones I actually see daily. Good Management. A lot of Online Training modules, less hands on training. Corporate Hierarchy, retail level employees sometimes feel undervalued and at the bottom of the totem pole."
good,"A typical day at work is busy and stressful, but rewarding. Not much different from any other retail setting. Lots of numbers and paperwork, but it all feeds into customer service. The happier your customers, the better your scores, the less stressful the job. Hardest part of the job would be balancing new and seasoned employees to work together."
good,I like my co-workers and it is always busy so time seems to go by quickly on a typical work day. The health and dental benefits are great and overall it is an enjoyable place to work. I don't mind getting up everyday and having to go to work.
good,"This company will train you into advancement. If there is anything going on in your home life, they are understanding of these issues. The staff is friendly for the most part in every branch I have worked. There is not a lot of drama. Every one is working to fill prescriptions and are really helpful."
good,i liked it there they had a split shift for me so it never got tired really close to hoe and safe environment to be in i recommend for young people...
good,"The only reason I have stayed with CVS is because I love all of my co-workers. The store itself isn't great, I personally don't think it's fair CVS stays open through the major holidays which results in their employee's missing out on spending that time with their families. The location of the store I work in is not that great which brings in a lot of drama which is another down fall. I learned a lot of different people skills as well as hands on skills upon working with the company."
good,"Good place to work usually had the needed equipment to fulfill our duties. "
good,"At work it's pretty the same stuff everyday, getting what you need done. and just checking people out when they are ready. it's easy laid back. You can also choose if you want to work union or not at some stores."
good,Working at CVS was a great way to get started in customer service. You meet a wide range of people from all walks of life and you gain a ton of experience from different situations.
good,They definitely will overwork you if you are a Technician. Luckily I wasn't and my boss was great! There is a lot of turnover because they have a very strict supervisor that tends to speak without thinking.
good,"The job was a great place to work, but there was always issues in the store with personalities and professionalism. Many employees couldnt respect the manager for the job he/she was doing to maintain a pleasant environment in the workplace"
good,Great people to work with who were always willing to help. It was always busy and almost always understaffed. There was a high turnover rate.
good,"The environment at CVS is great. Very friendly and welcoming. Its usually very busy. I enjoy working there, coworkers make it enjoyable. The most enjoyable part of the day of course is making the patient happy."
good,"The management was attentive and showed a bit of care when it came to their coworkers, they were also very supportive on our progress and accomplishments. When it had come to my coworkers they were very depressive and off-putting. I had to deal with a certain ""Chicken Coop"" group of people, it was almost as if no matter any of the good we had obtained was shredded by their lack of morale."
good,"Enjoyed my experience, was my first job as a technician and gave me much needed first hand experience regarding pharmacy as a whole outside of the classroom."
good,"This company has been good to me over that past 6 years! "
good,"Good stepping stone job, not long term thing unless you REALLY love training. "
good,"When you train at OmniCare, you work 8-4:30.  After training, no matter what your situation, you have to work the 1:30- midnight shift."
good,"My job consisted of inputting prescription data into the computer, ,communicating with insurance companies, filling prescriptions and customer service. I learned about different drugs, their uses and inventory management. The hardest part of this job was always being behind due to being understaffed but in turn this helped with my time management skills and customer service."
good,I been at this jobs for a little over 6 years. Colleagues are great. IT is a fast paced type of job but we are all team players and we get the job done.
good,"I worked in a very small department. I loved working with my co-workers and supervisors. My direct supervisors were always great at expressing appreciation on an individual level, however the company as a whole did not. They have good benefits and options and are health driven."
good,I learned much of my knowledge about pharmaceutical drugs from working in the pharmacy. Learned how to deal with insurance companies as well as explain parts of what the prescriptions were for.
good,"Nice place to work, enjoyed assisting the members. Also great place to move up in the company. I didn't like the shifts bids that were required. Overall nice place to be employed"
good,"Typical day is good. You are given the opportunity to handle you job without minimum management overview. "
good,"Working at CVS Pharmacy I was responsible for entering new patient information, scripts, and insurance information. I was also responsible for preparing prescriptions, and handling the checkout line of the pharmacy. Working in a pharmacy helped better understand how insurance coverage for prescriptions works, and information about certain medications and their side effects. The most difficult part of my job was having to explain to some patients that their insurance did not cover their prescription and that the would have to pay extremely high out-of-pocket costs if they wanted their medication. The best part of my job was constantly learning about the medications I handled and how they helped people and what their purpose was."
good,"I learned a lot about this program. Its worst and provide good discount to customers."
good,Learned a lot from working retail pharmacy.  Co-workers were great. Bust most of the time which made the day go by quicker.  Learned to appreciate patient care.
good,Various schedules available. Great work environment and co-workers are supportive. Management could be better trained in professionalism. Things spoke about at interviews are not followed through with.
good,I think CVS is a great store to be your first time working because it teaches you a lot and will mature you also it will help you self evaluate yourself
good,"Very Busy place, learned a lot of things. The hardest part of the job was not being able to satisfy angry customers. The most enjoyable was seeing customers leave happy."
good,"Not having enough security presence wasn't a good thing, but it was a good job to start off with in college. Good place to rack up hours and meet new faces."
good,"After training you are placed on a welcoming team. You take calls helping customer with online orders. Very easy job, not too many irate customer."
good,"I became medicare part d certified. learned a lot about the prescription drug world, management needs more knowledge I felt the agents knew more then the managers."
good,"At CVS Caremark I handle inbound customer service calls relating to Medicare Part D prescription drug"
good,its an ok place to work not really good for a family man to build a life around being that your days rotate more then often.More better for high school people or those close to retirement
good,"working at CVS gives you a great experience as CVS is always busy, might not be easy working there as its hard work and constant, but at the end it gives you the experience needed to be able to compete in the market."
good,Depending on the location many pharmacies are busy all day through.  Constant customer relations are created and made with each individual patient.  New programs are developed and instated within the company to help improve patient health and safety.
good,"Good place to work overall the best part was the benefits they offered the hours were ok they did expect everyone to work ""mandatory"" overtime which is not really mandatory because that would be illegal, but is very very strongly encouraged but most people have kids and family obligations so cant really work all that overtime."
good,Great place to work if you like fast paced action and great people. Learning all the ins and outs of the job will take a while but very fun and exciting.
good,"I process data entry (electronic, hard copy, and telephone), fill prescriptions, phone service, and cashier. I am directing staff and managing team to provide the best customer experiences. I also oversee inventory management and process inventory returns, orders, and counts. I have been working here for 8 years, so I learned most of my skills and knowledge through work experience. My store and pharmacist managing is awesome, however, district and regional management are not that great and expect more work from the technicians with less help. My co workers and I do the very best we can to manage metrics and scores all while trying to focus on customer experience. The hardest part of my job is to train workers to have a good work ethic and drive to be the best they can be. We have a lot of call-outs and we are so short handed at least one day during the week. The job requires multi tasking and being able to troubleshoot problems, but there are some that are one task oriented and do not want to engage in customers. I really enjoy what I do as a technician. Knowing that I am helping others on a path of good health and recovering from illnesses really brings joy to me. I try to be the best and helpful technician for all customers that I can and create a better experience for them at CVS."
good,"Coming in to work means you can work the register or be on the floor. It depends on who is on the schedule and the abilities. I've learned to deal with customers much in depth because you learn what they actually need. The management is professional. I've worked with different groups of managers and it really depends on who it is. My co-workers are always easy to get along with. Like I said before, I've worked with more than one group of employees in this store and it has been good. The hardest part of the job is not having the customers' wants in the store and having to send them to another store. But either that, I've loved customers that are so nice and are open to conversations."
good,"some days you are working from behind sometimes 2 days backlogged.Because of high turnover rate of techs the "
good,"This environment was one of my best experience yet , from working daily to great work staff but the time was cut short when I enrolled myself into college"
good,"Productive and fun workplace . It is past phased environment working in CVS."
good,"Good place to work- management continually have shifting priorities."
good,Customer service working cash register and photo lab also stock cleaning and answering phone calls Having mornings meetings to discuss what we have to improve on.
good,I started as a cashier but quickly moved up to Assistant Manager and then also helped in the Pharmacy as a Pharmacy Technician. It was a GREAT learning experience.
good,"Very busy, nice co workers, The customers are always fun to be around. The hardest part of the job is telling someone their prescription is not ready yet"
good,"This is a job for students. You need all the energy in the world to withstand the volume of customers who come in and out. You have to be patient because a lot of the customers complain. You must be able to troubleshoot in a very fast manner. Overall, i don't like the job"
good,if cvs treated their employees the way they treat their customers every employee would be happy and enjoy working their. pay should be higher for everything you do at cvs
good,its very hard to progress in the company if you are not close with the right people... a lot of times the staff is not properly trained so those who are get a bulk of the work to do.
good,over the 28 years I have learn to work with different work styles and as a result allow me to adapt some of their traits.I have had many co workers in different states and as a result I was able to adapt to wor styles
good,"the work is challenging and a fast paced requires attention and accuracy to minimize errors. it is never slow and it gets busy in a minute. I learned a lot  about medication and medication interaction, ordering medication and billing."
good,"too much to do with to few people on staff to do. not enough hours for employees, no lunches if you don't want to be behind all day"
good,"Typical day at work involves taking inbound calls from members who are confused or have questions regarding their prescription plan. In my experience, management is understanding of trying to balance work and home life. Supervisors are very helpful and coworkers are great! Hardest part of the job is being yelled at by members because their insurance plan sucks or they can't afford their medications, most enjoyable part is the PTO they give you and the opportunities to work from home. Pretty easy to experience new things within the company as long as you show initiative and do your job. They are working on raising their morale and making it even easier to get promotions. "
good,Very productive and fast pace work where at times we run around the pharmacy to get things done. Everyday we get our job duties done and does not leave anything behind. All co workers get along very well and best team I've ever had. We were as one and communicate with each other well. That is one of the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job was going on our breaks. For 7 years there I've learned a lot at CVS Pharmacy. I've learned about recalls and how to sent it out and inventory management. To manage the team and building trust with everyday customers.
good,"Typical warehouse/distribution job. Great benefits, somewhat caring management, (I cant speak for the corporate side, but my immediate leads and supervisors were actively interested in my progression through the company) This company doesn't pay it's workers a living wage."
good,"Days can be tiring at times. work requires standing all day but you get use to that. ultimately it all depends on your attitude, whether the day will go well or not."
good,I worked for this company for almost a year. I started having finacial problems and car trouble. Which lead me to having to take the bus to work something i was not use to at all. So the first week of me having to take bus i was not getting to work on time and i let my managers know that i was going through a transition with having to take the bus and that i might be late trying to figure out what buses i need to take. But they were not understanding at all and fired me the first week of me taking the bus.
good,"Every place has its pros and cons. CVS is no different. The slowness to give full time positions and benefits (14 months) with no way for a manager to reward hard work and give it sooner is ridiculous. The only way to do that is promote people and there are only so many positions to go around. Plus, not everyone who is a hard worker necessarily deserves a promotion. Other than that, the company strives for excellence. Customer service is the number one goal, as it should be. Without customers, a company has no business. The on the job and continuing education keeps techs and pharmacists at their best and always improving. I have learned a lot from this company and its employees. Other than the benefits situation, it is a good place to work."
good,"I enjoyed working with this company , but feel like they have top management issues, and will continue to have high turnover rates until they remove the old managers that have been there for a while. its built on dishonest, and the managers stick with each other even if they no its unethical."
good,"Must be able to greet customers and keep them happy. I'm not fond of the MyCustomer program's and it's insistence on a 100% survey score or it counts as a zero, which isn't fair to their employees."
good,"Lots of work your day will go fast, always something to do had to receive the products and ship products. co-workers work together to help get the job done. "
good,A typical day at work consist of completing all task before shift. Coworkers are always willing to help. you meet a lot of people everyday and try to help the best you can.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to play a part in helping someone start their career with CVS. Being able to work with stores in several states allows the opportunity to learn different state rules and regulations.
good,"Obtaining Reports, monitoring company policy and procedure compliance. Staff performance evaluations. Enjoy motivating and developing  co workers, by training and setting goals.  Patient inbound calls could be intense, however I found pleasure in resolving patients issues and concerns"
good,The company has grown in many ways. The company is very aware how busy and stressful can be at some point. It is important that going to school for pharmacy tech will know the difference between retail and non-retail pharmacies.
good,"Very fast paced, difficulty due to constant changing scheduling.  Management difficulty to work with, would be better if front store and pharmacy worked together."
good,"customer service, stocking, filing documents and cash transactions was a typical day. I have learned to become more personable. co-workers and management were fair and the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all daily deadlines."
good,"My co-workers are family and they like to help, teach and make the workplace fun on days that aren't so desirable or rough."
good,"CVS has positioned itself to be the leader in retail pharmacy and the service it offers.  Almost every new initiative in the last few years is directly related to customer satisfaction, patient health, and regulatory practices.  This is refreshing, but the manager has an abundance of responsibilities that are always growing.  You get to run your pharmacy as its own business."
good,The typical day was involved customer interaction. I learned how to fill prescriptions and handle insurance. The managers were easy to get along with.
good,"When you work here, you will definitely earn your pay. I am tired everyday, but I do enjoy what I do. Pay should be more. hardest part of the job is lack of staff."
good,"CORAM is a great company to work for. Coram is a diverse workplace and fast paced. There is this rewarding feeling you get when you help patients with treatment no matter what position one is in. From the receptionist to the Branch Manager, most of the time everyone participates in daily duties to make sure the patients get the exceptional service they deserve. The worst part of the job is Management. Sometimes they spend all day in meetings while the employees bend over backwards to make sure the patients get the service they deserve. In fact, the company may run a bit more smoothly if management actually included themselves with everyday assignments instead of spending so much time in management meetings. When Management is out on the floor they do not provide a helping hand, instead they micro manage."
good,The work is good however the morale of the office is low and feels like being micromanaged.  The supervisors and managers will work with you when they can but the upper management is rigid and inflexible.
good,I always liked helping a customer in need of assistance . I was a cashier and a stocker. I learned how to communicate on a one on one basis with customers.
good,I worked for CVS almost 10 years. I was a hard working and dedicated employee and I felt like it wasn't paying off. I wanted to move up in the company and I never got anywhere else than a pharmacy technician. I think over all they are a good company to work for but they don't really care about your needs and what you want. They only care about how something will benefit them and their numbers!
good,"Small projects. No job security. May not have job ofter two months project. Good office location, friendly co-workers."
good,A typical day includes coming into work and working the drop off station. Accepting scrips from patients physically and through E-scribe. Typing up the labels for medication and then also counting and bottling medication for patients. I would also handle the cash register at times.
good,"CVS Pharmacy is a good place to work.  It is a very fast paced and busy environment.  The people I work with are the best pharmacy techs any one could ask for.  The volume of prescriptions we fill a day is incredible for how small our pharmacy is, and I couldn't ask for better people around me to help.  The hardest part of the job is being short staffed because CVS is cutting hours for pharmacy techs and the pharmacists.  This puts more pressure on everyone to get tasks done faster so we do not fall behind.  The best part of my job is the working with my co-workers, and seeing the normal customers come in and knowing them by name. That truly is a great feeling."
good,"fun place to grow and meet people, I also learned a lot with computer skills and learn to compounding. The co-workers are inspiring and give me a lot of insight."
good,"During my time there, we were constantly under staffed and the higher ups didn't seem to care as long as our quotas were met."
good,I was a technician with CVS twice. I did enjoy working there and liked the people I worked with. We all worked well together. Scheduling was flexible. Benefits are too costly however
good,CVS is a good place to start out if you never had a job before. You can even grow in the company also if that was something you were looking for because CVS also has great opportunity to grow.
good,I enjoy the work. I started i the call center as a rep and then I applied and got hired for a finance position. I seek part time hours or 3x10's.
good,"Working for CVS Health has been a rewarding experience. It has its ups and downs, but there is a lot of favoritism. Sometimes the hard workers with the right attitude don't get looked at the same way as other employees would."
good,"kept you on your feet, did allow a break, had good pay and benefits. schedule was alright. co workers were rude and judge, customers were awesome.job was easy."
good,The most enjoyable part of that job was helping people. The hardest part of my job was the time management. My co workers were kind towards me but some of them were blunt. The management was a bit unfair towards the staff and residents. I learned how to use new equipment within the home.
good,"Okay place to work but not really any room for growth or organization.  Management lacks professionalism and experience,  but overall not such a bad place to work, love the expereience and time spent there!"
good,Working at CVS is never boring. You always had something to do. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers and had to increase your patience and motivation to ignore their rude attitudes towards you and find the best way to help them.
good,"Great work environment, Great people. I love the job security."
good,"The high volume of prescription being filled. Short staff to attend to every customer in a timely manner. 90 % of the time customer are patient understand short staff with and running around with your head cut off like a chicken. I have learned a lot about this your with health insurance, inventory, data entry of refill on prescription. Dealing with professional on level from doctor, nurses, insurance company and prior authorize with the process for customers. I managed incoming new staff on training and intern. I get along very well with my co-worker all are team player to get the work assignment done. Multi tasking between front register and drive thru. The most I enjoy about this job, that I was able to assist customer of getting their medication and making them feel better with a smile."
good,"A very productive day and can be over whelming at times."
good,the management was very friendly and cooperative. I worked for 5 hours a day and it was fairly productive. The staff was really nice and so was the management. They didn't give me anything i couldn't  do. Management was very understanding. I was very good at the tasks they would give me.
good,"Extremely busy workplace. So busy that I couldn't leave on time most of the time I worked. Coworkers were mostly young so it was a good thing they had the energy, it made it great to work with them."
good,"Depending on which department you work in. What ever you do, do not post for the paper claims department, they have no idea what they are doing in that department."
good,This company has been bought out by CVS Health Services and all jobs will be eliminated by 2016.  Many current positions will transistion to CVS
good,"overall OK working environment. Sometimes it can be very busy and customers are hard to work with. Need to work well in a team, and have other who are team-workers as well. this can make the job good and horrible depending on team mates"
good,"Great company, friendly co workers though situations that were high stress. Not for those who don't like change to their daily work"
good,"Great People, Crazy busy environment. Constant Military turn-over due to relocating and getting out of the Navy."
good,This was a 4 day assignment typing dictaphone minutes of a hearing.  Everyone was really approachable. Never dealt with Management. There were no hard parts to this assignment but I did enjoy the structure in the workplace.
good,"nice benefits,staff helpful in passing md test,flexiable hours short breaks, deal with alot of patients, long dAYS, MUST BE ABLE TO WORK WEEKENDS"
good,The shift starts in checking all queues to ensure that all prescriptions  are filled in accordance to their importance and to make sure that the customer are able to pick up medications on a timely manner. Everyday is a learning process from identifying different kinds of meditations and the applicable laws that entails in filling them. In addition to this learning the proper ways to process expired medications in accordance to both federal and state laws. The hardest part of this job is dealing with different customers specially they come in with different conditions and not all medications are covered through their insurance. Being eloquent and precise in explaining the process is important. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help and part of the improvement of our customer's overall health and well-being.
good,Could have a better direct supervisor with a better open door policy.  Direct management team needs to be more approachable and willing to listen to subordinates.
good,It is a nice entry level position. I have worked there for 2 months. I am looking to advance in the company. I hope I can get a raise soon.
good,A typical day will be getting patients ready for they day giving them shower dressing and feeding them. I learnt a lot in working with older people like taking their temperature and helping them with medications. The management is helpful and we do a lot of team work. the thing I enjoyed most is seeing them smile at the end of the day.
good,"CVS Health is  a large company with many different avenues. It can be difficult to contact the right person for help.  In our department, there was a great deal of turnover in the representatives.  A great deal of time was spent on training new workers."
good,Fun fast paced work environment that allows for steady growth and valuable experience. Very engaged with customers and working to find solutions to benefit them
good,"Unfortunately internal advancements are based on Who you know and not What you know. Culture Change is needed.  Nepotism within management, upper management blind to internal structure."
good,"High-paced workplace with supportive store manager. Inspiring staff, ability to grow and develop. Ability to override and train new employees/problems."
good,"Excellent place to start a career, tough to quickly advance though. Would recommend CVS Health to anyone looking for a long lasting job."
good,The job requirements and expectations change constantly.  The co-workers are great.  The advancement opportunities are difficult to come by and the compensation for promotion is not equitable.
good,"Looking for a way to grow sales and manage a maximize your team for better productivity."
good,I like  what  a was doing  tech  work  the people . I worked  with  working  on things  sometimes  learning  to fill  meds  how  the carts  work. I  had  good managers  and supperviers  but  co.  down sized me said  my job was not there any more.
good,Its definitely a step up after the starter job from college. I'd recommend this job. 8 hours a day .. 40 hours a week. The perfect temp job you can find.
good,"A typical day at work consists of non stop multitasking and customer service. The ""team"" environment is very helpful in making everyone's job as manageable as possible. The Pharmacy Manager and Staff Pharmacist are very hands on and approachable which allows for open communication and smooth workflow. The most challenging part of the job is explaining to irate customers the parameters of their prescription coverage. Often times, these customers don't care what the explanation is unless it's what they want to hear. The most enjoyable part of the job is resolving problems for patients, especially the very challenging issues. The patients' gratitude makes the effort worth while."
good,Like every company this one has its good and bad qualities. Overall this is a good company. The management can be a bit off on some days due to some issues that need to be worked out.
good,Great place to work with a lot of added benefits would recommend again. Did not however appreciate the overall outlook of the company and could not remain working for them.
good,didn't really break the mold but is a good company with good start up tools has decent co workers along with a great deal of employee savings on products
good,"As far as pharmacies go, CVS rates at the top of the list for me. I was able to gain considerable knowledge in the areas of retail, stocking, ordering and employee management."
good,"It has been a great job to become familiar with pharmacy etc. but it is not  job I would want to do forever. I love my colleagues, I do not like customer service in relation to this job."
good,"This is a good company to work for, however i feel i don't have a way to advance myself through them.  Being a pharmacy technician can be stressful at times like any other retail job."
good,"I have worked for CVS Health for 8 years now. I started as a cashier and worked my way up to assistant manager. I have worked at a few different stores and learned how each store runs and operates differently. I have worked at stores that are the worst in the district to the best in the district and learned how to operate and manage them. I have had the pleasure of working with many great people throughout my journey to other stores. I have great friendships with other CVS Heath store managers that would greatly provide great recommendations as to how well I work, how dedicated I am, and how willing I am to learn something new. CVS Health has given me the opportunity to learn many aspects of being a leader, managing, and creating professional relationships. I have learned the importance of work culture through my experience with CVS as well as my education."
good,it was a temp to hire so there was no job security. it was nice to work for you stayed busy helping to rollout all the software and products. I learnt a lot there. the management where always will you to help you if you need help or where struggling with something as far as questions.
good,"great place to work, very challenging, great health benefits, not in my field of study, I think I need to get back to my roots"
good,Omnicare is a fortune 500 company with pharmacies located in more then 45 states.  It's a leader in the long term care industry providing service 24/7 to skilled and assistant living facilities.
good,I worked at CVS in high school.  I learned stock inventory and organization.  The managers really cared about their employees.  My co-workers were people I went to school with and I didn't get along with all of them.  The hardest part of the job was making sure products placed on the shelf during stocking were the correct.  I really enjoyed customer interactions.
good,"This was a ground level, beginning of training.  I worked this as my first job of cashier, and then became shift supervisor and a pharmacy technician."
good,"It was nice, but the hours were long because it was slow paced most of the time."
good,"In the Pharmacy at CVS on a daily basis, I would complete data entry for prescription medication for customers, fill prescriptions, and had cashier experience with customers as well."
good,"My 8 years with CVS has been a Learning Venture. With great training modules and high volume work experience, CVS still lacks the opportunity for career growth."
good,"I have worked at Omnicare over the last nine years and have seen many changes."
good,I enjoyed working here when I first started between the changes in management I grew to not like it as much. It was a happy place with good pay. Until management changed and so did the work environment. it became more tense then laid back. and everyone would snap at everyone. The DM made it very uncomfortable when he would come in on his routine visits. Also became unorganized with people pulling people off there stations and taking breaks when they weren't due.
good,"Pros"
good,"It was my first job in US and I had a great experience at the workplace. "
good,I enjoyed working at (Caremark) before they merged with CVS. The management was good and the benefits were okay but there were no opportunities for advancements.
good,"fast paced work environment. "
good,"Very busy and most of the time understaffed,but overall a decent job. Customers can be rude and hard to deal with at times, but your co-workers are fantastic."
good,"It was fast paste learning, have to keep up. Always a new challenge and task."
good,"Assisted customers in finding items on the aisle."
good,"dealing with rude customers. typing prescriptions, answering phone"
good,"CVS  Pharmacies are a good stating place to work if you are a technician. This was my first job as a certified Pharmacy Technician. There was always plenty of work at all times, also it helped me develope professional skills through customer interaction. when patients were angry or upset, i learned how to deescalate the situation. All in all the pay was a bit on the low end, however the experience I obtained were well worth the hard work."
good,I enjoyed all my co workers and I especially enjoyed the customers meeting them helping them getting to know them. I have worked in this field for a long time so it is very natural for me.
good,The job provided me with opportunities to enhance my customer service skills and to learn cashiering.
good,"It was a positive experience and moved to something else. Customer Service, Healthcare, claims paying, Insurance verifying, working with other departments billing, customer service department, other specialty pharmacies, tracking packages."
good,"My day usually starts off on the phone being a call center. We handle third party insurance claims for prescription insurance claims. If the call volume is slow for the day we are able to go offline and work authorizations via fax. Hardest part of the job is sitting all day, I like to move around and not have to be in one position all day. I enjoy the job because it has a set schedule but now that I have started attending school I am unable to keep a set work schedule."
good,AS a intern of pharmacy a learn more inside the pharmacy. I want the opportunity to work here
good,"My job on a normal day consists of filling opti fill dispensers, filling manual prescription orders plus packing and shipping orders in a pharmaceutical warehouse. Over the past 2 and a half years I have learned how to perform the duties required by pharmacy technicians while being efficient to provide the best service for the costumer. Management does a good job I feel to push the employees to achieve our goals. Management also recognizes hard work and rewards employees for going above and beyond what is required. My co-workers are a good group that are well supportive of one another and work well together for the most part. I believe the hardest part of my job is maintaining a good rate when being put in production areas. A big part of my job is based on numbers so I have to maintain a high level of productivity while being careful not to make an error. The most enjoyable part of my job is that its a positive work environment that has great benefits and different job skills for me to learn"
good,I work with others to take in needed information and process/fill patient prescriptions. We are also cashiers and perform customer service duties in store and through the drive thru window. We have work stations that do different parts of the whole job. We have contact with insurance companies and patients. In all steps we are working to serve our patients to the best of our abilities to improve total health.
good,Great Fortune 10 company with several sites in N. Texas. Just started a family so the work life balance no longer worked for us.
good,"I enjoyed the years I had worked for CVS.  I learned much about customer service, sales and pharmacy operations.  Working with a dedicated team we were able to accomplish many goals and provide solutions to our customers."
good,This is an awesome place to work. the managers were awesome and the customers were friendly.
good,A great place to work. A good environment to work with customers by applying excellent satisfaction towards to the company.
good,"A typical work day at CVS will often entail many customer transactions- including but not limited to; returns, writing rainchecks, providing multiple transactions for one customer, large monetary transactions, greeting every customer, stocking shelves, cleaning shelves, bathrooms, aisles, etc. Your experience working there may largely depend on management, although most tasks are not difficult. Coworkers are helpful and will assist when asked. "
good,Management should offer bonus and compensations for employees who perform above average.
good,"It's seemed like cvs was the best place to work especially since I didn't already have my license as a pharmacy technician; however, that was just an incentive to get you in the door. They are not micro managing to much that it seems you are always walking on egg shells and not worry about the customers that are in front of you. They want people to think they are all about the peopel but are far from it."
good,"This company is completely micro managed.. Everyone involved in the company is chasing numbers and cheating the system to make their stores look better than they are. We work 14 hour days with no breaks, go to meetings on our off days, and basically write pages upon pages of action plans.. It seems all we do at CVS is write action plans for our employees, how to better customer service, and how to treat our customers... and yet we are to busy writing about this and going to meetings than actually implementing it into our stores... "
good,"I loved working at Omnicare while it lasted because they were very flexible with my hours while I was in school, and even during the summer they allowed me to take on more hours. "
good,"CVS Caremark relies heavily on the contingent workforce in order to meet the company's overall quotas.  That said, there are many pros and cons to this type of strategy.  While they may be able to easily weed out the ""bad seeds,"" many employees feel that their work is unaccounted for and do not feel motivated enough to attempt to apply for permanent positions.  On the other hand, the best way to fully understand something is by actually going out there are doing it (mostly) on your own.  There is not a whole lot of guidance, but there is still some type of support.  There are always going to be good days and bad days.  You may have to force yourself into looking on the bright side; that everything is a learning experience and that, eventually, you will pick up on the process.  From speaking with both long-term contingents and perm employees, they ALL had a negative experience their first few months.  The general consensus is that it gets much easier with patience and an open mind."
good,The days were never the same. Always an adventure. Never a dull moment.
good,"talk with people about their benefit plan."
good,Pull EOBs to determine why a claim was partially paid or denied. Resolve any issues in order to have claim reprocessed and paid.
good,"Ask me, I will tell you!  Currently I am a Supervisor of Operations in the Paper Claims Department.  Everyday is fast paced and attention to detail is critical!"
good,"A typical day consists of challenges and new opportunities. Everyday I help process prescription orders. I am exposed to many different insurances. I work with rejections and learn how to solve the problems and resolve any issues for the patient. My main goal is to take care of the patients to the best of my abilities. I am very competitive with myself. I like to push myself and learn as much as possible."
good,You work very hard here. It's a fast pace job...which I liked
good,Basically worked by myself along with a pharmacist.  Hardest part was trying to stay busy so I would not fall asleep.
good,It was a good learning experince the management wasvery good and very respectful. the co workers were very polite
good,"The company overall is amazing"
good,"A typical day at CVS involved greeting and helping customers. Working with the co-workers was great fun everybody had an understanding of our mission and work their hardest to achieve customer satisfaction. I learned how to handle angry customers and resolve conflicts in a quick efficient manner. Management was also very effective in creating a good work environment. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the corporate aspects when it came to pay roll, raises, and promotions. The most enjoyable part of my jobs was helping customers resolve conflicts and help them anyway I could."
good,"A typical day of work includes typing prescriptions sent in from doctor offices, filling those prescriptions, answering telephones, and providing customer service to our patients. Everyday is busy, which makes the day go by faster, and I enjoy that. The job is very stressful, but at the end of the day it is rewarding. The hardest part of the job is customer interaction. All employees of the pharmacy do their best to provide excellent customer service to each and every patient, but more times than not, our patients are not the happiest of people, which is something we completely understand. Most patients that come into the pharmacy have just come from the doctor's office due to being sick. Patients want their medicine fast, in order to go home and get better. It only becomes hard when the customers are not very patient with our already busy pharmacy. Despite that, we always feel rewarded when we know that we made a difference in a patient's health. That's the most important part. The most enjoyable aspect of the job is the teamwork. All of the CVS employees that I have worked with are always some of the nicest people. We all know how to work together, and if there is conflict, it is immediately discussed. In order to keep the pharmacy running, all employees need to work together to make it easier on everyone, and a more pleasurable experience for our customers. Management is okay, I just wish my hard work would be more noticed than what it is. I go above and beyond for the company."
good,"I worked with students and interns, there were floaters for the most part but it's a great place, you just have to know what you are doing."
good,"CVS is VERY focused on customer service, which I love about the company!"
good,"A typical day is waiting on customers, counting med's, putting them away. "
good,"Our goal is to help our valuable customers in their path of life."
good,I worked in the pharmacy where cvs willpay for you to be certified and learn and train. Awesome clean great environment. Loved it.
good,A great family environment. Managment was rude and unethical.
good,This is a fast paced environment with a good team. I learned a lot and enjoyed my time there.
good,Most enjoyable part of my job is making my customers happy and also knowing that they know i care and that they are in good handsand no matter what the circumstance I am going to do everything I can to make things easier for them.
good,Very organized and professional staff.  Pharmacy is very well kept and there is an increasing growth of customers.  Pharmacists are very well trained are able to handle the array of situations that can arise in the pharmacy retail business.
good,"Workig there was ok, really dont have do much negative things to say about it.  Pretty good pay and 6-7 hour shifts was a plus."
good,"walk in some days to a clean workload and some days to a 2 hour backup.  We process the prescriptions, make patient and doctor contact calls, resolve insurance issues and provide immunizations."
good,"I loved this job. It was very laid back but yet you always had something to do. The staff there was amazing very willing to help and teach. I am a quick learner so there wasn't really anything I would consider hard about the job. My favorite part of the day was showing up, once I made it to work my day was awesome and relaxing."
good,Im so glad that i started here to gain my work experience. It though me so much to get me where im at today.
good,"full pharmcist duties, employee guidence,customer relations."
good,"A typical day at CVS Pharmacy starts out with a bang. The Pharmacy Techs are sometimes literally running from place to place from open to close. "
good,"Its's an ok job as a entrly-level pharmacy technician.  A typical day included typing prescriptions into the computer, greeting customers, cashing customers, drive-thru to counting and labeling medicatios."
good,I enjoyed working in a fast paced environment and enjoyed the interaction with the customers. My co-workers were a delight to work with.
good,CVS/Caremark is a growing company that provides unmatched services in the healthcare industry.
good,Cvs was a good company to start a career in but they did not give their employees enough opportunity to move up in the company or to give suggestion of how things could move smoother.
good,"A fairly fast paced job, my typical day is spent at the register.  We are encouraged to be friendly, courteous, and helpful, and I work hard every day to achieve these goals.  Since starting this job, my cash handling skills have improved greatly.  My ability to handle situations where I have to think on my feet to help customers out has also improved."
good,"Very good company to work for, my pharmacist that i had as my daily manager was great at her job and made me feel at home there. The team i worked with on a daily basis was also fantastic"
good,Overall CVS is a great place to work. I have learned a lot from my time and experiences there.
good,Each day began with staffing to meet departmental goals prior to shift start time.  Management was cooperative and encouraging.  Co-workers were mostly working moms who worked hard to meet our goals and go home to their family.  The hardest part of the job was being able to meet goals with a fluid staff as we rarely had a full turnout.  The most enjoyable part of the job was challenging the employees to meet those same goals.
good,"This was a very good job to have during school. I was able to develop different skills by communicating with other employees and customers on a daily basis, whether is be in person or by telephone. I was able to work under the Pharmacist and help them get prescriptions filled for the customer in a timely manner while ensuring the quality of the prescription as well. I also would communicate with doctor offices to resolve and issues with a customers prescription. Working as a team we were able to get a large quantity of prescriptions out to the customers daily. I enjoyed getting to meet many new people and even become friends with the regular customers."
good,"CVS pharmacy was good to me in many ways. It allowed me to acquire knowledge in many areas of pharmaceuticals, from legal to everyday consumption. "
good,"A typical day included ringing up customers, facing the store and developing film and digital photos. I liked the people I worked with and I was always willing to step up and do whatever they needed of me."
good,"The company is good, the worst part of the job was dealing with the customers. They are rude and obnoxious. The customer is always right?? Yeah, sure. pffff. Sometimes, sorry, MOST of the time they are wrong. You'll have an easy day, then get slammed with a bunch of people coming at once, and they get mad that they have to wait in line."
good,"A highly capable professional with eight years’ experience with a Fortune 500 pharmacy service organization in a fast paced environment.  Seasoned professional in pharmacy operations, quality analysis, ISO9000 quality standards, pharmacy standards and regulations.  A proven record as a team play and problem solver.   Excellent training and communications skills. "
good,"overall, low wages, no guarantee in work hours, work load not distributed equally "
good,"There is a high volume of business traffic that runs through the store everyday. Customers come and go, but the loyal customers love the customer service that is provided and how quickly the process of addressing any issues can be resolved. "
good,"I have been in retail for 8 years now, it has been an experience. I have met some interesting people throughout the years and some great pharmacists whom have made a place in my heart and I have also met some people and pharmacist whom i would prefer not to work with anymore, but in many cases you have no control over that. You can expect that at any job. The hardest part of the job in retail pharmacy is to explain a person's insurance to them and how and why their co-pay is so expensive. Out of all the years and experiences I don't regret a thing about working for CVS Pharmacy."
good,Worked with some good people.  Management was okay. Ran an automated machine to dispense pills in packets.
good,"CVS has been a wonderful company to work for. Even though some days customers tend to redirect their frustrations to you personally, you learn to better yourself and be more level headed even in pressuring situations. "
good,A typical day at work was fast pace and filled with customers. I have learned that if you learn quick its the only way to be successful in your work. Co-workers push you to do your best and to never give up trying your best. The most difficult part is stopping what you are doing to work with a customer then come back and finish counting or restock but overall the job is fun if you laugh and make sure every customer leaves happy.
good,"Participated in order entry, transfered prescriptions, and counseled patients of drug side effects and use."
good,"Answered inbound customer service calls from doctors,pharmacist and members on medication benefits"
good,Cool coworkers but  every disorderly work place lines alwats long no matter how many people in there workin customer always angry even when they see u trying to do your best
good,"The job was rewarding due to the nature of the clientele served by the organization. Mental illness was being treated very successfully, and this was very gratifying to see the clients improving their quality-of-life."
good,"There are four stations in the pharmacy in which the technicians are in control of, three of which are customer interacting. The first station is ""pick-up"" which is where the customers pick up their medications. It is our responsibility to correctly distribute the medication to the correct individual as well as manage money. The next station is ""drive-thru"", this station has the same responsibilities as pick up the only difference being the patience is in their car rather than in the store. Production comes next, this is where we fill each prescription. There are numerous accuracy tests to ensure the correct medication is being dispensed to the right individual. Drop off is the last station a technician learns because it entails a lot of pharmacy knowledge as well as multitasking. At drop off we type the prescriptions, enter patient information including insurance benefits, make doctor calls, and fix any insurance problem that arises. Drop off can become overwhelming very fast, but it is personally my favorite station because there is so much involved. I enjoy multitasking and constantly having something to do as well as maintaining an organized station."
good,Workes as overnight pharmacist and had little interaction with public
good,"Working in as a pharmacy tech for CVS has been a great experience. You are in a fast paced environment at all times and if you cant keep up you will fail. We fill thousands of scripts a day and during that time you are liable to come across a few upset people. These people can either be in pain, on mental meds, or just not having a good day but the environment is very diverse. Working here has its ups and downs like any other place, but i can honestly say that it has strengthed my customer service skills and I have become more patient. My computer skills has also improved due to the usage of computers on a day to day basis. The best part about working in the pharmacy is that you learn something new everyday. I love that, being able to work and learn at the sametime is by far one of the best thigs in your career."
good,"It's a typical, busy retail pharmacy. The best part for me is working with customers and helping them get what they need. There is rarely any ""downtime,"" and the workday usually flies by. So, it can be stressful at times, but I have never had to carry work stress home with me."
good,Great co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the continued addition of clients or workload and the hours that it took to complete the projects.
good,"I would fill prescriptions, fill the script pro machine as required. Other days I would be assigned in customer drop off to enter prescriptions."
good,"Very busy Pharmacy,staff was always hard working. We tried to at least make time to say Hi, but sometimes there wasnt even time for that. You were lucky if you got to run to the bathroom."
good,"My job at Coram keeps my mind active. I feel as if I am helping ill patients by ensuring that I have given my all to their case and double-checked the quality of their information. If I do not give them my all, they could miss a delivery, get billed incorrectly, or have to deal with other frustrations that a seriously ill person should not have to deal with."
good,The work is steady and you have everything you need to complete your daily assignment. Co- workers are friendly and very helpful.
good,I enjoy the work that I do. A typical day may start with 2 or 3 new referrals of patients going home from the hospital needing iv medications. The most difficult part of my job is dealing with new employees who do not have the core values or job dedication that I do. To see someone who is there just for a pay check.
good,"Individual management was better here than my last resource, People wanted to assist one another here. Eployer rewards were pretty decent, and encouraged employee base to perform at their best."
good,"all i can say is one for you one for me. know what i'm saying. hardest part of my grind at omni was trying to care if these dirty old hags got their daily calcium, enmas, and eye drops. oh and got erbody was from the U.N. bus stop."
good,"Good management team and co-workers. Learned customer service, pharmacy practice, photo practice, and computer programs."
good,"if you want to learn the pharmacy and can handle pressure, youll be fine."
good,Retail pharmacy has it challenges and rewarding experiences like everybody else
good,"Argus Health System is great company, i learn how to help patient understand there insurance , by advising them of there copayment,"
good,inbound calls ordering medications and giving rx drug coverage
good,A small office environment with likeminded people aiming to support the frontline organisations locally with all things volunteering.
good,I loved the job and the people that I work with. The only faults that I had with this company were that if one did not have a degree they were looked over for advancement. That person in most cases was more or equally as qualified as the person with a degree.
good,pretty laid back and not too much of the management constantly on you
good,"Most of the time this job was easy. Talking to customers in a call center environment about different situatuins dealing with medication and insurance. I was sitting at a computer for 8 hours a day. My supervisor was one of the best in the company. She was very easy to talk with and took my request for information seriously. I didn't get to speak with my co-workers offten because of this type, but when I did everyone was very friendly. The hardest part of this job was not being able to speak to people face to face and haveing to follow a very structured call/action flow when responding to member. The most enjoyable part was being able to help someone who really needed help."
good,Contact with Medical Doctors Office arranging shipment of specialty Pharmacy item to their office upon verification of insurance coverage of patient. Collected coinsurance & co pays as part of process. Learned about a special pharmacy item that helped premature babies to survive for their lung development to come to fullness. Most of the co workers were contract hires as seasonal Oct-June contractors as was I. The hardest part of the job was learning an infant did not survive the regimen of the program. The most enjoyable part of the job was finding that a high percentage of these infants were actually surviving.
good,"I do enjoy working for the company, however I am a bit disappointed in job growth. Inside Sales representatives have no room for growth. They are not considered for Outside Sales positions and management positions are extremely limited."
good,"Stressful, busy, constant multi-tasking and pleasing customers. As a career doesn't cut it."
good,"While at CVS Pharmacy, deployed in a all-around capacity with diverse requirements, ranging from customer sales and communications to managing the receipt and processing of store stock and deliveries. Highly responsible in all roles,"
good,I enjoyed what I did at Caremark and the fact that overtime was allowed. I could go in and work on weekends if I wanted to and also stay long hours on my regular days. This was very beneficial and useful during weeks when I had to be off on one of my regularly scheduled days.
good,"A very diverse group of workers, very fast paced, customer service oriented company. This company strive for well-trained employees that utilize continuous learning and ways to improve the company and skills of their employees."
good,Hardest part is keeping up
good,Typical day is very fast paced with not enough time for lunch. The hardest part of job is keeping rules and regulations for all 50 states together. co-workers are great - fun and very sincere about their work.
good,"My jobs fills about 600 scripts a day. We are always on the move, never a dull moment. We have customers from all over Hartford County because we are a 24 hour store and pharmacy. I have been trained to input prescriptions and bill insurances. I have also been trained to fill prescriptions. I have learned different medications brand and generic names, what they are for, and how they work. Our store is very focused on customer service."
good,"competitive pay, decent benefits, understaffed though, you were very busy, good co-workers"
good,"Large, strong company before CVS/Caremark merger, employment severed twice due to 'cut backs', (so I rated job security low), great benefits and pay, as well as perks and bonuses for apt achievers. Large company with a very understood chain of command."
good,"I feel as if I grew up here, I went to school for billing and graduated and came right into my job"
good,"The people that work there are amazing, it feels like one big family. However, the communication between the high level of staff and lower level, is very poor. There is no direct communication between managers, directors, etc., and customer service employees. This causes confusion, and communication errors very often. However, it is still very enjoyable to work for Caremark. The company has very good values when it comes for family and the care of its employees."
good,"Throughout my career, I have had a proven track record of sales and successes as well as being commended with numerous awards. I have been on two new product launches, which has enabled me to produce well above business plan. I have been recognized for going above and beyond, not only in my own endeavors but also in assisting those around me."
good,"Flexible work hours, great co-workers, management can be a little better. The customers are gret though!"
good,I enjoyed the expericence as a floating technician. I was compensated for gas each time I traveled.
good,Cvs has been a great place to work. I have been working overnight shifts for a while and I just need a change.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is providing excellent customer services to the customers. Throughout the day a new skill, such as maybe finding a better discount on meds for a customer may be found. The work flow is at a very fast and high demand."
good,There are times when you are short staffed which can make it a little stressful.  You can be promoted from cashier to shift supervisor quickly if you show potential to lead and work hard
good,"Feel that there are few pharmacist could do better than relying completely on technicians, specially because of specify number of hours they don’t have enough techs on duty. Take responsibility of making sure that the bins are neatly kept at end of shift for next day and all drugs are back on shelves."
good,Good place to work. Exposure to complex situations and independence to work and make decisions. New avenues to learn and grow if the right leadership choices are made.
good,I learned how to retrieve and count meds and my boss let me practice my brands and generics. I wished I could have worked longer. But my boss told my school our students has no work ethics which was not right. They just didn't teach us nothing and I hated that area. The job was good CVS is a good company. My teacher can assure you we did our best. But wasn't excepted and trained properly
good,Work production was a requirement of 15 cases per day minimum which I was given a short time for completing because I was a new employee when I was working for this company
good,Was good experience but not a career. I would never trade my experience working for CVS but I never would want to return. CVS does not have the best benefits or even hours that you request constantly.
good,I enjoy working for CVS. Good company to work for.  I would like to see the company expand more in my area.  I have worked alot of places but feel CVS is a good company to possibly retire with.
good,Knowing that you were able to help the customer and that you feel like you made a difference . They are flexible with the hours as well. Theres always something more to learn
good,If you’re working in retail pharmacy you must be able to handle being on your feet often and much energy. Confrontation must be handled appropriately and professionally
good,The 4 stores l worked at appreciated my dedication and efforts. l will return to CVS to manage a store. I worked there 8 years part time. CVS appreciated me as a person
good,Treats employees and customers in a manner which demonstrates respect for the individual and creates an environment of inclusiveness. Acknowledges others.
good,I worked here part time. I had all around flexibility. The store was always clean. I was able to work another job while working here. It wasn’t a problem for me at all.
good,"You try your best, all alone with few coworkers closing with you, and run into a nice conversation every now and again. Then more often than not you run into a rude customer or thief."
good,"The turn-over in Pharmacy Technicians is huge. The company has recently cut back on the available hours for Pharmacy Technicians, which has been quite discouraging."
good,the cvs company is so great. its very cool and fun and relaxing at times. i wish for every person in the world to work at cvs for just a one day. so great
good,"The job is a really good job and has great hours. The crew there are kind of friendly, but they tend to be to themselves. The job is easy but challenging."
good,"Advancement was provided to me for a Shift Supervisor due to my skills from previous jobs with my Customer service approach.    I have and do enjoy my title and work at CVS however due to all the night shifts I am seeking a Full Time job which will allow me M-F and possibly sometimes on Saturday,  Need to now be on day hours continuously with set hours.."
good,"Pretty positive place to work at. Learned a lot about retail. You deal with a variety of people, old and young. The hardest part about the job is keeping up with surveys about customers experience. You"
good,"The location were I worked had an extraordinary rph who cares strongly about his team. Corporate not so much."
good,"This is my first home health job, I get to schedule and plan my work day. I work independently and  i also feel part of a team. I have learned I love to teach people. I love the fact I get to help people to be able to stay at home and get their medical needs taken care of.  The hardest part of my job is last minute additions to my schedule when i think my day is done.  I love taking care of my patients and making them feel more comfortable about administering their own meds at home."
good,"I enjoyed working there and the people I worked with, the store manager didnt seem to care about the store at all.(ex. Holiday displays left out several months after the holiday)"
good,"Up beat, family oriented workplace. Management is nice and willing to help you advance to the next level with ease. Coworkers are team savvy and are always willing to help as well."
good,"I worked at CVS Care mark as a customer service rep and it was ok, there is a lot of stress of time spent on calls and dealing with ALOT of angry customers its a customer service job so you cant take anything personally, they are mad at the comany not you, overall as long as you do you job and perform at thier standards you will not get fired but my class had 30 graduates and by the one year mark there were 3 of us left so there is a high turnaround"
good,The workers there were friendly and the management looked out for their workers.  The hardest part of the job was sometimes trying to get the doctors' offices to cooperate with the pharmacy.  The managers tried their best to accommodate everyone's schedule.
good,The company itself is alright. With every office comes a good and bad department. But even in the good departments training can be a really big issue. I've never been to a department and had someone be able to sit someone down and train them exactly how to do their job. It usually is doing everything you can to help show the person you're training to grasp a whole new job. Training is something that could be improved.
good,"As a member of the management team, the typical day at CVS Pharmacy is very face-paced. As a manager, you are responsible for customer service, product replenishment, and cash control. The team at the particular store I worked for was very close knit, especially the management team, which made it a more enjoyable work environment."
good,"I worked in the pharmacy through high school and college. It was a fun job and I learned a lot. It gives you a great insight into dealing with people. If that job paid more money (at the time there was a $15/hr cap), I would have stayed for years."
good,"Working here wasn’t bad, you learn a lot and come into contact with all kinds of people. We don’t get paid nearly as much as we should for some of the things we go through"
good,"As a cashier I ran everything in the store form stocking, customer service to cashier and also cleaning the store and after customers. It was a great and learning experience. Had to advance in school so had to leave CVS."
good,A typical day at work can vary based on the day of the week and time of day. Some days can be faster then others and some hours of the day can require you to be faced-paced.
good,"Handled business interactions with buyers, sellers, and potential business partners. Counseled and supplied customers with samples and handled all in-store transactions. Designed and created all marketing materials and displays."
good,Was a fun place to work a very fast pace. Made the day go by fast . the things i didnt like was always working and no grace even if your car broke down. They are ran on a point system
good,"My job is great, I am able to work with a great team and help customers each day and recognize regular customers. My coworkers and pharmacists are great"
good,"Customer service is important, and as part of the team you will have to muit task, work at a fast pace.  Advancement is huge in the company, but definitely location matter."
good,"Great environment to work in but gets so boring and usually not enough people staffed in a day. Everything could be better, Always stocked up items or made sure area is clean."
good,This was a clinical rotation for the completion of my degree. I learned a lot in a very short time frame.  Friendly and helpful staff. The systems and processes are user friendly and ensures accurate patient engagement.
good,You're not overly worked but you are expected to do your job and have great customer service skills. At CVS it is all about the customers and helping them out.
good,A typical day at work is making sure that the customer receives their special medication in a timely manner.  The hardest part of the job is the time zones.
good,Initiated and received refill authorization requests. Entered prescription data into a processing system. Prepared and packaged drug orders. Affixed prescription label to prescription container. Reconstituted medications. Compounded non-sterile preparations. Compounded sterile preparations.
good,"I like this job it has taught me a lot proud to be apart of this experience. However that's all I can say, remember a job is a job its what you make of it."
good,The Culture was very diverse which I loved very much and the learning process was a very 'hands on' technique. There was room for advancement and compensation was given to further your education as well as classes and courses that were required to ensure you were up to date regarding various policies and procedures. You could also enhance your hours given at different locations picking up shifts. The downfall in my experience was there was not enough room in the budget to meet your hourly/pay criteria where other locations was almost a must at times.
good,"Point system and lack of flexibility is a not good also the after call time that they stay on us about it ridiculous . But the environment is pretty laid back but can be stressful with the constant calls , sad stories,  lack of assistance and emails . Overall all a decent job. Management seems sneaky and very slow about getting things done.  More training is needed and not virtual training."
good,"I worked in a relatively high-volume store in Richboro, PA. The team of pharmacy techs and pharmacists helped me out when I was learning and gave me more responsibilities as I went. They couldn't help how awful some of the customers were, so we suffered together and made the best of it."
good,It is a good company but the only thing is some of the managment is bad. The company will take care of you and the is always work to do to stay busy. The only other bad thing is that the company budget hours to the store is really low.
good,training is 6 weeks. three weeks in the class and three weeks out on the floor on the phone. it is a new company i believe it started May 2019. pay is good to start with. you get raises every 6 months which is a 6% increase which is the most i have ever seen in my career. But only if your attendance is good and your not on any written warnings. they are looking to promote from within lots of positions to fill. So if you want to advance you can do that too. The hiring process is lengthy but worth it. its a job everyone experience is different not here to bash no one just giving facts.
good,"It was always hectic. So much to do, so little time. Often cleaning up other employees messes. Running around the store like a mad woman trying to get everything done before the end of shift."
good,CVS was a good job but I was looking to leave retail. The store was lower volume so less staffing was in place leading to lots of work to be completed with fewer hands to do it.
good,"For the most part its a good company to work for. Great co worker's and friendly customers as well. Unfortunately they had to cut hours for a lot of stores. They expect you to do the same amount of work, sometimes even more with twice as less hours. Most of the time it was not possible and it put a lot of stress on workers and customers."
good,"this company is great to work for, wishing the pay was more than they give for starting out.  Working your way up takes a long time.  Being diligent gets rewards and you are recognized for your efforts by your immediate supervisor."
good,"Depending on management, it can be a great job or one that you dread going to. Luckily store managers don't typically stay at any store for too long.."
good,I have been with the company almost 1 year. I have seen several people leave and very little movement up for other co-workers. I am now seeing that advancing isn’t necessarily an option.
good,"The only reason I am considering another job is my immediate boss, she is younger and the enviorment has become toxic and stressful for everyone, and sadly not much can be done, because its just looked at as drama and girls not getting along, when its all around hurting the performance of our store."
good,"Pay here is wonderful starting out. My only issue, and why I am actively seeking employment elsewhere is that new employees start out making drastically more than I did. It is very discouraging training others to do my job who make more than me. Management is aware of situation and says it could be months to years before it is fixed. Disappointing situation, so I'll go be a new hire elsewhere for higher pay. Don't accept less than you're worth. Great benefits almost 4 weeks of PTO. I've enjoyed my time here."
good,"Great place to start your career. Long-term advancement only possible for upper levels."
good,I was a front store cashier at CVS at first and then I transitioned into the Pharmacy. This company gave me the opportunity to become a Pharmacy Technician which was great. I work part time.
good,"I worked 3rd shift in one of the only 2 24 hr store in my city. The work was easy going most nights, but we had a lot of sketchy people and shop lifters come in at night. There was a lots of nights that I was required to work the front store alone. My manager was pretty easy going as long as you showed up and did your work."
good,It’s an alright job.  It’s basically a beginner pharmacy tech job.  You get your state certification through CVS and later on they can pay for your national certification.
good,This company is a good opportunity to start your life in the workforce but there is little effort for employee retention and growth beyond the store level
good,A typical day at CVS was usually productive there was almost always something to do even when it was slow. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers to find what they wanted and seeing them go home satisfied with their purchase.
good,Providing great customer service. Learned more about different people and their needs. Management was great at my store. Dealing with difficult customers was the toughest part of the job. I enjoyed the staff i worked with
good,"Working at CVS is fun for me. I enjoy the work I do and helping people. I have learned store open and close procedures, how to stock shelves, and put up sale tickets, how to process transactions running their register.  I have also learned how to process stolen or damaged items. I also clean the facility, including windows, floor, changing trash, and picking up trash. I enjoy helping customers find what they're looking for, and telling them ways they can save money at CVS. That is the most enjoyable part of my position at CVS."
good,"This store by far has the best group of coworkers and the best management I have ever worked under. However, it seems like 90% customers here are just rude individuals that WILL go rate you as an employee online and try to get you in trouble. Luckily, my manager has almost always taken my side and I’ve never had any extreme situations with customers but the hatefulness gets old fast."
good,"If you do what you're supposed to be doing its is fairly easy to move up, every time you move up a position there is a drug test though. pretty good working enviroment overall"
good,CVS Health is a great place to work if you want to get involved in project management. You collaborate with several departments and get a chance to work on a project from its inception to it's deployment chain-wide.
good,Everything was okay but all busy. Cutting hours and everything. No breaks and toxic environment. Pay was good. Manager is great. So far developed my communication skills.
good,"My typical day at work includes answering clinical questions, counseling on medications and communicating with other healthcare providers. The most enjoyable part is helping patients"
good,Working for CVS provided a very flexible environment. You could work at home or in the office. The environment was pleasant. The only significant issue was that there was a certain air of uncertainty because of a pending merger with Aetna. Because of this merger cost cutting was done which resulted in my getting let go.
good,"Working for cvs is fun a lot of opportunities to leran and good training, good team work a lot of work day by day, enjoy to be able to help my customer and grow the business."
good,My experience with CVS health was a great first experience. I learned many things from dealing with customers and problems that I have to use my own knowledge to surpass. The only con is sometimes poor management would make my job harder but like I said I would surpass those problems.
good,Everyone was so nice to work with. This is a great place to work and you will gain a lot of experience for other jobs down the road. Management was great and always willing to help.
good,"With my experience in working for CVS Health, I agree that this is a great company. However, the managerial teams can be selected a lot better than what I've experienced."
good,"You do have the opportunity to advance at CVS but you have to spend your life there pretty much. The schedule  can be tiring when you have to work days and nights and sometimes go without weekends off. If you are a people person with a good attitude, this is a good place for employment."
good,Like all jobs politics is involved. If the DM or above doesn't like you even if you are productive and run a good store it doesn't matter. They will find a way to get rid of you.
good,Working at CVS was okay unless you had a bad manager like i did we had high turn over rate which cause us not to have a assistant manager for over the time i worked there.
good,"Working at CVS as a pharmacy technician is a job that requires attention to detail as well as efficiency. There is no sitting for technicians so you're on your feet the whole shift whether it's 4 or 10 hours. 30 minute lunches were not enough for the longer shifts. While there, I was hired on as part time staff but I would work almost full time hours but just short enough time that I didn't receive full time staff benefits."
good,"The hardest part of this job is not being able to help med D patients "
good,Management constantly cuts work hours per week not enough staff to accommodate daily required task.Overall great starting point in career. but looking to expand skills and experience . I would like to mention that if you are interested in working here that you will need to have a great work ethic and great customer service experience.
good,"good pay, does not give enough hours based on production, flexible scheduling, lots of training,  not much room for growth, hardest part of job is learning the mathematical equations for days supply based on measurements"
good,"My regular every work is running the cash register, helping customers and stocking/cleaning the store. The main focus for employees at CVS is helping the customers as much as possible, so I mainly help customers more than anything when I'm not at the register."
good,"Very good corporate culture at CVS. Offers great benefits and a fluid overall structure."
good,Learn what you can in a fast paced environment. Use this as a stepping stone for your future endeavors. I do not regret my time with CVS and without that job I would not be on the career path I am today.
good,"I loved working here, super chill and you start remembering faces and they remember you due to the fact its a pharmacy and many of the people are there on a every-other day basis. Managers were cool and gave me time off when I needed it even though it wasn't paid I still appreciated the flexibility the job gave me and they really will work with you if you're a good worker. Only downside is the advancement, no matter how much of a good worker you are that doesn't always make you the ""favorite"" and that's how this company works. Just take the cards your dealt and play the game with this kind of job don't take it too serious if they don't take you serious."
good,"The daily work of a technician is not terribly difficult, but the company spreads its employees too thin. We have to work way too fast to meet the demand and hours are always getting cut. Our ""scores"" are based entirely on customer service and things we can't control, instead of the actual quality of our work. Corporate is always trying to micro-manage when barely any of them have ever worked in a pharmacy. Overall, I'm disappointed in what pharmacy has become. This isn't healthcare."
good,"This was my first official job. I learned so much about customer service, patience, and so much more. I made so many great friendships and I would change a thing."
good,"CVS HEALTH is a  typical call center.  You have to met your metrics.  CVS HEALTH is forever evolving.  It’s very fast pace environment.  It’s an okay place to work.  Management are okay. The rules are strict, but fair.  Procedures can changes within an hour.  They have work from home opprotunities if your metrics are at a meets.  You get a 6% pay increase when you move to the next level of your position , however you have to be constantly remind your manager you want to be trained."
good,"Worked as a contractor for a short period of time and witnessed massive growth and transformation within the organization."
good,CVS is a great company.  Leaving for another opportunity would be a difficult decision.  I've had a number of great opportunities to demonstrate my abilities and delivered significant value for CVS.
good,Workplace culture as enjoyable as staff were all rotated between stations evenly.  Upper management seemed to care more about the store than the n employees.
good,A job that is good for people looking for part-time work. the people I work for are great and every helpful when starting this new job. CVS is a good place to work.
good,"Overall enjoyed the time i was there, learned a lot about what goes in pharmacy and what it is to be a pharmacy technician. Again a great learning experience and great in the job experience!"
good,I really enjoyed working for CVS. Never received any written or verbal warning about anything. Every time they would hire a new Tech they would cut my hours and give them to the new Pharmacy Tech. Pharmacist would not give me a reason.
good,"High volume stores have to beg for enough tech help. Training for techs is good.Blend of high quality techs, and cashiers is different at each store. Rush timing to complete Rx's increases stress. Most enjoyable times were at poison prevention sessions at elementary schools. Teachers and kids loved it."
good,Public health organization that prides itself on helping patients on their path to better health through continuous technological and policy and procedure advancements
good,"Fill prescriptions, data entry, monitor wholesale order, maintain pharmacy stock levels, fill outstanding orders, maintain cleanliness, interact with insurance companies, fulfill cashier and customer service duties."
good,"I left a SM position to come in as a Manager in Training.  This was pitched to me as a 3-6 month program.  I don't think this is a bad company, but just be sure you ask as much as you can in the interview, this is a two way street."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, the location I worked out of was really really busy."
good,"Cvs is your typical work place, good benefits, pay not all that great, hours okay, managment could be better, there is alot of room for growth within the company. Over all okay place to work."
good,"CVS Health has an amazing company mission and vision, and from my experience, the management is very solid. The working environment at the headquarters is enjoyable."
good,Always changing  many times not for the better.If they could focus on the positive work each employee brings to the floor and give credit for the good they do things would be great
good,you get good medical experience as a start. since most places will ask you to have previous medical experience. you can start here and earn some medical experience.
good,"A typical day at work is harrowingly stressful. I, a 21 year old healthy female who regularly works out experienced angina, panic attacks, stress hives, and extremely long shifts due to customer and prescription volume. My pharmacist could not hire more technicians, and some of the techs we had were TERRIBLE but couldn't be disciplined because of skin color or disability. I loved my job, I loved my boss, I loved my coworkers, but I had NO life outside of CVS- we were simply too busy. Often I would come in on days off, come in early and stay late to try and help ease the insanity to no avail. My PIC would come in at 4 am to get started, but by 11am (we opened at 8) there would be 14 pages in the queue, 3 of them red. The new computer system that has been implemented bottle necks the already swamped pharmacist, forcing technicians to wait on the PharmD to approve entered scripts before production, reverify insurance rebills before we could print them, prep C2's all by themselves. It's sheer insanity, and yet approved tech hours are still dropping. Something needs to change."
good,"I worked at a fairly large call center. Calls I received were for Medicare prescription members.  We also assisted with annual enrollment.  The job stress increased the longer I worked there, which contributed to my separation.  It does offer great exposure to the pharmacy industry for those interested or pursuing that type of career.  I'm grateful for the experience and knowledge I received while there.  The hardest part of the job was handling complaints about prescription orders that weren't received, for various reasons.  Many people depend on meds for numerous reasons, from maintenance to life sustaining.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping and connecting to different people."
good,The job was demanding but the crew I worked with had a good work ethic so i went as smooth as it could. When i helped out at other location however some staff did not display great customer service.
good,Great company to start with when first coming into the pharmacy world. The pharmacist I worked under had no problem teaching on the job. The staff was always fun to work with.
good,"Able to work  autonomously  out of home office ."
good,"This is a nice work place, Wonderful and friendly people, and makes the work there so easy. The manager and everyone there are supportive and wants you to succeed."
good,Excellent Pharmacist and techs. Nice front room staff. Poor scheduling for students and not much flexibility for exams and virtually no time off to return home for holidays.
good,"I learned management, money handling, and customer service skills. "
good,"As a part time cashier 7-8 hrs a day is normal. A typical day as a cashier is to restock shelves while performing multiple tasks such as answering phone calls, helping customers with their requests, handling purchases at the front desk, etc. The store I worked at was bearable because my co-workers were extremely nice and fun to communicate with. Since this was my first job I learned how customer service works and grew more tolerable to a stressful job. The most enjoyable part I would say is having the opportunity to talk to co-workers while performing required tasks. The hardest part I would say is handling customers needs when things go wrong such as wrong photo orders, unavailable products, COUPON PROBLEMS, etc."
good,When people leave the organization and they are not replaced. The expectation is that current employees will take on those responsibilities. No consideration is given to current bandwidth issues being overdrawn.
good,I work in the LTC department at omnicare. It is very stressful and the work is monotonous.  benefits are great and the vacation time is awesome. other than that the pay is just decent and the atmosphere is very stressful.
good,"Very busy, not a lot of hours, flexible for the most part. Great pharmacists. Very fast-paced. There is never a dull moment. There is a lot of room for growth."
good,Every day is considered a challenge as I am facing new challenge and new opportunity every day so I have learned in addition my experience is boosted. One of the fruity values is team spirit(team work). The hardest part is increase the growth and market share. Create the value and how to create customer needs and satisfy it by the right solution to catch up the great opportunity.
good,"Favoritism, drama, confusing training, fast paced, high expectations. Overtime only when asked, double pay for holidays, catering lunches for special events."
good,"I enjoy working with the staff and the supervisor is very accommodating to the needs of the employees. The work is low-keyed and involves contacting/consulting patients, filling, and verifying prescriptions."
good,"On a typical day I would work within each work Q (pick up, drop off, drive thru, and production) I learned about a lot of different medications. The management was okay as well as the culture. The hardest part for me was learning drop off. I requires you to have knowledge about many common insurance plans. The most enjoyable part was pick up. There were patients that I got to know very well."
good,"The job offers good benefits and decent pay for Long Island. Opportunities for growth and locations are available across the US. The one negative, the current Admissions manager treats the department like its high school. If you ignore her, the Company is good to work for."
good,"The management team and colleagues I have are great. Corporate does not have an efficient or realistic district leader in the area. Otherwise, the customers are friendly and the environment is nice."
good,The CVS Health is a great place to work. I've been with the company for awhile and the employees get along very well. If you're looking for a place that gives opportunity for growth CVS Health is a great place as it provides it for all that apply. I've worked with several managers as our specific store is the training store so keeping things organized and clean is a high priority.
good,"The job is okay. I have learned SO MUCH and has helped me so much to prepare me to be a nurse. At my store, my pharmacists seem to get very overly stressed and one even raises his voice and just leaves the store to smoke. In a stressful work environment, this is miserable. The manager is good though and good with hours. The hardest part is when patients think that we are totally in charge of their medications and take no responsibility - that is annoying. But you get to help a lot of people which is great."
good,"I enjoy being a Returns Technician. Other than the hours that I work, my department is great.  I work independently in a fast paced environment. I really can't complain."
good,"I loved working at CVS, for the fast pace, variety of challenges and some seriously good people.  It's a big ship, with lots of fast moving parts.   If you are up for the challenge, it is heaven; if you're not a ""worker"" type, don't get on board (LOL)."
good,"You are on your feet all day, going back in forth picking items for the store you have, you have 2 breaks, only if you work a full eight hour shift, and you have a unpaid 30 min lunch..."
good,"Hardest part about the job is working as fast as possible while working in a small space havung to walk around other workers without slowing them or yourself down."
good,A typical day consist of heavy call volume on a daily basis. Our callers consist of patients and members inquiring medication prescription information.
good,"CVS is results driven and measures every task. If you can't manage to drive the metrics, this is not the place for you.  Follow the workflow and adhere to the trained method to succeed. They say they are managing behaviors, not numbers. But, everything is based on the numbers (ie. Performance evals and incentive awards)."
good,cvs was a great work experience. they taught me pretty much all the pharmacy skills I have now bc I worked for them since I was 16. The company as a whole is doing great things
good,"CVS Caremark has given me a wealth of experience over the years.  The company's mission, values, employee engagement, and culture are things I appreciate the most."
good,Great place to work. Love that we are closed door pharmacy. The managment here I feel care for their staff. The job is relaxed but can be a bit too relaxed at times.
good,"The intern program is a great opportunity to learn and develop skills related to the profession of pharmacy. You are going to receive a virtual training, on the job training and then you will start working like a tech with some supervised pharmacist tasks."
good,"Excellent benefits and work environment, extremely professional individuals I feel like I have family here. I am excited to see where I can advance in the future."
good,"Decent place to work.  Lots of management changes. Great place to get Medicare Part D experience, paid holidays plus four or five extra floating holidays throughout the year."
good,"Typical day: fairly consistent hours"
good,"All in all a good job, the new store manager took over and re arranged everyone's schedules without consideration. Inventory was tedious.  Pharmacy staff were always my favorite."
good,"Working in any warehouse is hard. However, CVS cares about safety and efficiency. The work is hard. You have to work fast. There is no time to just talk to people. You are given 2 paid 15 minute breaks where you can talk to people or use your phone since you can not take them inside the warehouse area. You are provided a locker and lock. They also make sure that whatever tools are needed to complete your role are provided to you. You will lose weight working here. Overall, it's been a great place to work."
good,Productive and learned a lot about the different medications. Learned how to mix medications. The customer service interaction was always fun. The pay is not so great for a pharmacy tech considering the PTCE exam was super hard. Also standing on your feet all day was the worst part.
good,"Not a bad place to work, can get hectic at times but overall, great way to learn medications and get to really be in the medical field. Flexible hours"
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at CVS was the friendliness of the staff and being able to help a lot of people. Once it was around the time that a lot of people were getting out of work, then things would pick up in the store, but nothing stressful. I learned how to give excellent customer service from the awesome management team."
good,"This is a great place to work. If your looking for a job growth this would not be the place. There is alot of overtime, they offer great benefits. Management is okay."
good,"CVS, a place that is always busy and you feel like you will never catch up. Never enough help and hours can be a little hectic. Overall I enjoyed my job and liked seeing how happy I made my customers."
good,"Cvs is an amazing company to work for. They believe i. Helping others with a low cost and always with a smile."
good,Early morning start...I collect hundreds of items from the warehouse that will be shipped daily to CVS stores in the surrounding area. Drive a machine around all  day.
good,I have been employed by CVS HEALTH for 11 years.  The reason I am leaving now is only because my position is being eliminated. Great place to work. I loved the company.
good,Great Pharmacy experience.  Fast paced environment.  Lots of patients interactions.  Staff management opportunities.  Building relationships with local healthcare providers.
good,"Depending on your position and manager, the atmosphere can be pleasant and in some stores it can be a circus. Pay is mediocre. The company recently gave pay advancements to be more competitive with pay rates as they were under paying employees compared to other companies in similar businesses."
good,CVS is busy but they dont hire enough people to help with the demand. The in store management is good but they are helpless because the cooperative management doesnt allow them to give more hours
good,"I was a positive great place to work, training was informative and management was very helpful towards there employees . Great projects and fun activities."
good,CVS Health provided me with good oppurtunity to hel individuals obtain education about using their medical and prescription benefits to their advantage.
good,"The store is very nice. All of the employees are very fun to work with and we all got along. Unfortunately, our assistant manager was the best immediate supervisor, and he kept the store together, but he signed a contract to only be at our location for a year and agreed to be transferred after the year was up. Our manager, is a little different. It is uncomfortable to be sitting in the office doing modules while he sits back and talks about other employees, yet is very kind when talking to them face to face. I don't agree with the management, and the store is somewhat disorganized until the big boss comes in to complain. It takes the manager to hear someone else's voice to put his foot down, instead of listening to his own. He does not finish things to accomplishment either. Someone had called to get someone's phone number so they can speak to them, and he said yes he would and that he would call them back, but once he hung up, he laughed and said ""yeah I'm not calling back"". I thought that was rude, and unprofessional. I was in the middle of training to work at the pharmacy, but my manager put my modules off for truck days and for me to be at the register instead. I could of had those modules done, and would have gotten paid for my training days."
good,As long as you worked hard it does not go unnoticed and if you have the right manager they will groom you and help you move up within the company. They also make sure that you have the tools you need to advance.
good,"Follow up on reports visit stores ,Training, leading others and making sales and scripts also customer service and profit. The best part is seeing my Team moving up with the company front store and pharmacy. The hardest part was the tracking all the training for the front store and pharmacy but the district was 100% and number one in sales ,service also profit."
good,Was a good place to work. Fair pay and hours. They were just under staffed when I was there. They try very hard to make the customers happy. We had our good days and bad days like most companies. All in all it was a good place to work
good,The job can be stressful as you are taking in a lot of calls daily. The managers will hound you at times for reasons that may not always be clear. overall the company has a solid system and is an ok working environment.
good,CVS is a great company to work for however some of their protocols can be repetitive. Overall my experience for working for CVS have been average. My most enjoyable part of the job would be impacting patients lives. The hardest part of my job would be how stressful it can get at times. I have learned all laws and regulations along with medical terms.
good,The Company is good to work with if you are dedicated and focused. Being in retail the hardest part is Customer Satisfaction and not every customer can be appreciative of your efforts but the key is to keep going and not stop.
good,"Typical workday is very busy and could be staffed a little better, not to where there is an over abundance of staff on hand, but adequate staff on hand."
good,The job i had would be better suited for a single person the hours i worked were total opposite of my wife. It is a fast paced environment that requires some medical knowledge as well as medical terminology.
good,You have to be ready to work a long day. Everyone who is not a manager is should look to work at least 10 hours a day with day going as long as 15 hours.
good,"while working for CVS i Learned a lot about pharmacy tech duties .cvs has grown my communication and social skills ,i also have received acknowledgement for these accomplishments ."
good,I thought the job was boring. They didn't care if you had a family and you were punished if your child was sick. Could have been a great job if their attendance policy was better.
good,"Great company Just need more money they start out at 15.50, great management, easy work. people complain about jobs but i realize as long as you work for someone you will never be happy. so as long as i get off and get paid im good"
good,I had an amazing experience at Omnicare. I found a passion for numbers within dosage calculations. The staff and management is helpful and friendly and want you to succeed.
good,"The employees were wonderful to work with along with most of the pharmacist however, the main pharmacy manager at the time was very verbally abusive and overbearing."
good,I was a good job to start my pharmacy technician experience. Unfortunately a tech is under pay compared to some other work places. The difference in salary is a lot.
good,Contract ended.Wished a million times I would have been hired as staff and not contract. Would have stayed forever. This was the best employment I have had in a decade.
good,"Buying power and clout across the healthcare spectrum from retail pharmacies to Medicare.  That said, sometimes too big where employers/clients can feel under valued,"
good,"I would like to have more flexible hours and a chance for advancement. CVS has great incentives for pharmacists but not for the pharmacy techs. I feel that as a pharmacy tech we get looked over and all bonuses are given to the pharmacist. Techs do a lot of the work and need acknowledgement just as much and opportunities to excel. Also, the computer optimization for scheduling is not very effective for a job/life balance. A computer can only compute what it’s given and not what is truly needed in a pharmacy."
good,I worked as a pharmacy tech with CVS while I was going through school. I learned a lot from my pharmacist and wouldn't trade the experience in for the world.
good,A great place to work for learning and training. Lots of overtime and lateral positions within the pharmacy to learn and train. Harder to move into management due to seniority standards.
good,The working experience was great. The cvs team was family like people friendly.  We got along good.  All my co workers had excellent positive attitudes which made working there excellent
good,"Overall, it's a good company. Like any office, the quality of your life there depends on your manager. I have a wonder manager, so it's good. There are others that do not have good managers, and their experiences are quite different. But I am lucky and would like to convert to a full-time associate before my contract is up!"
good,"No complaints except for poor pay. The breaks were always timed but covering shifts were hard due to corporate slashing the hours for each store."
good,"Okay place to work, Stressful and fast pace. I don't have any other positive things to say. I don't like the way they calculated the older hands pay when they raised the starting pay."
good,"My experience with Omnicare was beneficial for me in that I learned about long-term care pharmacy and IV compounding utilizing the 797 Sterile Compounding procedures."
good,Pharmacy at a fast paced department was different from my previous job.  I found the change in computers from one company to another easier than the upgrade in computers made by the company.  I realize that being one person with incomplete information is easier than all of us trying to work a new system.  I also realize that training on a live new system is always a rough 2-4 weeks.  I worked extra in a number of other chain pharmacies  and found it helpful in updating my site.  I enjoyed working with good technician support at all the sites I worked .  When I experienced a death in my family the pharmacy team covered my absence very well.
good,This company is amazing they pay you well and have amazing benefits no complains at all the culture here is great you can here music and enjoy the people that work there.
good,The people I worked for were absolutely wonderful and it makes it so much easier to work there. My manager was the best!! The hardest part of the job was dealing with unruly customers.
good,"good people to work with, lots to learn and gain. management was helpful and helped to teach many things, I'm sure each store is different but i enjoyed the work location which brought in great customers."
good,Filled with opportunities to grow. Just have to work a little bit harder. Customers are the best part of the job. Keep head up and don't get discouraged.
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working for this company.  I have learned a lot about the pharmacy business and insurance,expanded my network and built relationships with many key people.  There's always something more to learn or a project to take on.  It's a very collaborative team environment but yet still laid back."
good,"The management was good while I was a employee at CVS, there was always a clear system to the schedule and the manager was always willing to work you."
good,Cvs was a great place to work at my only complaint was the change in management. I worked with CVS for a year and 4 months and had been through three store managers.
good,"CVS Health/Caremark is a good place to work. They have reduced some of their benefits to some of their employees, but it really depends on your campus and your job level/role; not all employees are the same."
good,"CVS is okay to work temporal not for long term, unless you plan to go to Pharmacy school and become a Pharmacist. You should plan to only work there not for the long term."
good,I worked there for over 10 years. everyday was different. training new employees was simple. stores were clean and ready for costumers.  i have recommended this company to friends
good,"CVS Pharmacy should reevaluate how they introduce and train their interns to the live day to day job responsibilities of a Pharmacy Technician, it would only benefit them in the long run. I think they overlook and dismiss interns that would have been loyal assets to their company if only they knew how to train properly."
good,Not hard but doesn't keep my interest or keeps me engaged. It's standard retail fair with a bare bones crew and little work hours to actually get anything meaningful dune in one day.
good,Very fast Paced. A lot of phone calls. I have learned a lot from working in this company. I enjoy helping the patients and getting my job done on a timely manner.
good,Great place to work. Management and team members are great. You support your zone as if it was your own business. You learn new skills and stay competitive.
good,I worked but things I'm shows and cleaned the carpet when they had carpet and I am returned the carts to the cart return section and that's pretty much it
good,"Aside from everybody essentially almost promised to be laid off going after a company like CVS, it was fun, it paid well and the only thing we really worried about it when is the next CVS layoff going to happen. Everybody who doesn't get laid off, ends up having a great time and moves up the corporate ladder eventually."
good,"My only complaint about this job was the management my first 3-4 years here. It was literally like an episode of Jerry Springer every single day. Nothing but drama all the time between people on the floor. One manager was never there to police it, the other almost seemed to encourage it. It was very literally the most toxic work environment for a long time. It was only after switching departments from private pay that I realized that there was management that cared about their employees and knew what they were doing. I wish I'd have made the switch a lot sooner"
good,"Stable company with many opportunities for advancement and personal development.  Most non-retail pharmacy operations are consolidated in hub markets of Scottsdale, Dallas, Chicago and Woonsocket (corporate)."
good,"Management was partial to workers. The work load was very heavy and at times impossible to achieve your work goals and demands. Supervisor was ""on and off"" personality."
good,"CVS/Caremark is a wonderful company. Engagement is high, and nobody is really gunning for your job or trying to start drama. The downside is no matter how you slice it, it is a call center. Prescription coverage has a bit more red tape than other call center type jobs, so expect better training and more focus on HIPAA when you start out. Attendance is a major issue, but if you are willing to work, and volunteer to take on more responsibilities, you can easily advance in the company. Management is completely transparent regarding goals and expectations, so it is easy to adapt to meet your desired performance metrics. Wonderful place to work as far as culture is concerned, but if calls get to you over time, no amount of potlucks can fix that."
good,"the company recently announced that they would be purchasing Aetna which sounds like a great idea for a bunch of reasons but it has resulted in changes to the district structure which may not be so great for the stores and most store got an hours cut in both the front store and the pharmacy which is going to make it tough to take care of customer as well as they should be, and will definitely impact overall store performance."
good,"I had a great career at CVS health with many different positions.  I learned Sales, Product management, Audit and regulatory support to name a few areas. "
good,"Great job while you're in school, hours are very flexible and loved my team. i learned a lot while working here that i can take with me to my future nursing jobs."
good,"I had fun. Work was fast paced but everyone would chip in so it wasn't bad. Management cared and actively resolved issues within the team, client and processes. It was a very goal oriented experience and I believe everyone felt like a team."
good,"- Work Day:  High Stress, fast paced, quick turn around, managing multiple projects across an enterprise"
good,"I am unable to provide any feedback as i am not authorized to discuss the company with any third party."
good,"CVS is a great place to work they are flexible with my schedule and the management is great too"
good,"Data entry for patients. Filing prescriptions. Verifying legitimacy of prescriptions. Checking in orders. Filling prescriptions, organizing medications on shelves."
good,CVS is a great place to work. I work with a great group of people who all genuinely care about customers and want to provide the best customer service.
good,Enjoyed working with hourly and salaried staff.  My job was part-time and temporary.  I learned a great deal about the Workbrain payroll system.  The atmosphere was professional and management did a good job.
good,Typical work day was more stressful then my other pharmacy job. I did learn a lot from other employees since this was my first pharmacy job. But the work balance in this pharmacy was not well balance. The pharmacy manager was awful and was the problem in this pharmacy.
good,"Mostly fast-paced, busy work days with plenty to do. Lots of opportunity for overtime. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting. They also used a staggered work schedule."
good,"Super busy i worked in one of the most busiest CVS in town, fast pace. My experience was good because my pharmacy manager helped me to learn. I was just getting out of School."
good,You can learn about many different facets in the pharmacy and what it takes to make a well oiled machine work cohesively. Coworkers and management are all readily available to assist with whatever tasks that you might need help with
good,"I enjoyed working at CVS, it is a fast paced work place and very rewarding, There are some good coworkers her and they are always willing to help others."
good,The people I work with are helpful.  There are great peer group exercises. You will feel like your in family environment.  Like working for this company.
good,"I enjoy working with the customers, as well as my coworkers. Great training program for the SMIT position.They are very accommodating in matching one's hours of availability with the stores needs."
good,Just go their with open mind!!!!! Put your best food forward try to learn as much as you can.Some people will love to put down in some will love to help you to sucess.but alway do your best no matter what.
good,"A fast-paced job that is truly helpful to patients on a daily basis. The best part of the job is helping the patients. The worst part of the job is not having enough tech hours to serve the patients as needed. My workplace is very good, and we are all like family."
good,Fast paced work environment. had to be a very detailed oriented individual. scan medications placed them into the right order. then we will print the manifest and prepare the bags for shipment.
good,Call center which provides excellent customer service. They provide great insurance benefits but have very little time for breaks. Overall okay working environment
good,"The ability to flex your time is a huge benefit from this employer. Most management personnel are encouraging, helpful and supportive. Team mates are great."
good,"A typical day starts with an immediate, fast- paced need to help the customers or begin with processing prescriptions. I deeply appreciate my superiors as they can multitask in a high stress environment. I work well with my colleagues and have a high regard for their work ethic. The hardest part of the current job situation is not knowing whether one can advance even as the volume of patients grows. I appreciate my colleagues as they can ground me as well as providing an enjoyable work environment."
good,"Good place to learn, grow, and take what you learned to move up the ranks or take the skills to a different company.  Management is easy to talk to, and get along with."
good,This job teaches you more details on how to help patients with getting their medications assistance. Helps open doors for more opportunity in the health care.
good,Worked 12 hour days at 4 days a week.I was provided ample support staff to get the daily tasks completed. Received ample relief support when asked. I was located at a single pharmacist store.
good,If you are searching for you first experience in the USA CVS pharmacy is a really good place to start even if the compensation are not that good still the multi cultural staff will help you integrate your self.
good,"I personally liked working in the Pharmacy."
good,"Face pace work day."
good,I work the overnight shift at a 24 hour location.  I work 7 consecutive 12 hour shifts followed by 7 days off.  I like all of my co-workers both in the pharmacy and the sales floor.  I do not get a scheduled lunch break so I grab what I can when the Computer system goes down for about 20 minutes at 3am for end of day processing.  I have good relationships with my pharmacy manager and staff pharmacists as well as all of my support staff.
good,"Working at CVS is very challenging on your body and mind. It is a non stop working environment. Many time I go 9-10hrs without time to take a lunch break. However, it has been a great learning experience. Managers are very knowledgable and eager to help you learn and develop."
good,"nice people, very fast paced and have to adapt quickly in the pharmacy department. The management is excellent but do mix up schedules which can be annoying."
good,"i would receive incoming calls from doctors office,pharmacy or patients regarding patients mediations. i would approve medications if i could . Transfer any calls that were not from our dept."
good,CVS Caremark is an industry leader constantly striving to improve the health of the community it serves.  CVS spares no expense with advanced technological improvements designed to deliver efficient and effective service.
good,"fast paced, and sometimes stressful but my managers coworkers always made the job fun. My managers and coworkers are really laid back.  The hardest part of the job is trying to do so many things with so little help."
good,The offices are very old and outdated which is unfortunate. The culture is lacking a certain bonding element because so many people choose to work from home.
good,"CVS is an OK place to work.  There is plenty of work and the days are busy.  However, for a fortune 7 company, there are things that could be made smoother for the colleagues."
good,"When I worked the re the environment, the culture and the atmosphere was amazing and incredible. I would definitely work there again if the opportunity came."
good,Working in the pharmacy at CVS is very fast pace. There isn't any time for breaks and most days you would eat lunch as you work. The time would go fast because of how busy it is.
good,"Came into work logged in and called doctors offices.  Manager wanted to get a response every time, but the doctors offices would not give a response most of the time"
good,"I enjoy working with my coworkers in this fast paced environment."
good,"I learned that there is cost effectiveness for current existing conditions with prescription co pay "
good,"typical work day, work all of my assigned accounts, assist responsible party or patient with payment arrangements, account resolution, update account information, Microsoft office management."
good,Customer Care Representatives need to be able to handle angry and aggressive calls from members.  Supervisors are always willing to help.  Very competitive among other representatives to make their stats and get rewarded.
good,"The job was 5 days a week and at least 10 hours days. We filled scripts for nursing and group homes, so we did not deal with the public only medical staff."
good,"Great place, depending on management and how well your associates work as a team. Very nice customers, feels great to go out of your way to help customers in need and to be kind and patient to them. Seeing their smiles was the greatest feeling everyday."
good,Good place to work. Not alot of upward mobility for non clinicians. Good solid company that you can learn a lot about Pharmaceuticals. Work place is clean and friendly.
good,Working for CVS was retail summed up. Being a 24 hour store schedules always changed. Employees were hit or miss. Customers could be challenging. But all together it was a good experience.
good,"as with other pharmacies, not much help for the areas needed to be covered. typical work day was 200 rxs in some stores to over 700 in others, depended on area. management at time I was there was not good, however that has changed. loved the employees in pharmacy. hardest part was lack of help"
good,"Enjoyed my Job and learn to do it well, Obtain skills that I'm sure will be beneficial in my future employment. work with a great team of people. "
good,"I learned a lot on the daily basis as a student that is pursuing pharmacy as his career, and recommend it to other future pharmacy students. As a student, my boss was aware that school came first for me and worked around my schedule a lot."
good,"It's pretty low for techs to work at honestly. Some district manager doesn't care about techs, just like pharmacists and interns. PICs are kind chill and very helpful to techs like me."
good,"CVS Health is a great place to work. Yes, sometimes it gets boring but overall the customers who always come in, are great. You hardly get a raise...."
good,"If you want to go to school and work, cvs is a great place to do both because there's a variety of positions and hours that are available. I love my"
good,Good company to work for besides a few issues with the management. Good working environment for the most part with the exception of a few not so professional co-workers.
good,CVS is a fast-paced work environment that forces time management to optimize work flow in a timely fashion. CVS offers lots of training to it's employees to ensure we are properly equipped to serve the needs of our patients.
good,i would clock in and go to get started in the deep freezer. then i would go stock the shelves. Also have to go to the freezer and put these foods and other items clean the shelves off and also stack the water.
good,"You learn a lot as a pharmacy tech. "
good,"I am new to this field, only having worked with CVS for approximately 1&1/2 years.  It is a very computer/insurance focused job, without a lot of real patient contact.  My pharmacists and co-workers are great people to work with!  Since I am only part time, I don't receive any benefits from CVS.  The only job advancement there is to look forward to is if you are anticipating pursuing a career as a pharmacist.  As a full time employee though, CVS has a great deal to offer."
good,"CVS is a steady paced pharmacy. I learned that there are multiple ways to get a job done, the end result is the same. We had a good management staff. It was a great enviroment to work in, everybody got along with one another.  The job wasn't hard, but if I had to pick name something that was hard about the job, it would be having to call a customer and tell them that their medication was on back order or that their ins. didn't pay for their prescription. It's hard to pick the most enjoyable part of my job,  I enjoy waiting on customers so I love pretty much every aspect of my job."
good,"I got very lucky to work in the specific store/pharmacy I was working in. I loved my coworkers and my 2 RPhs. There are many flaws within the higher people of the company chain, and they are a very cheap company. With that being said, I started from the bottom (Pharmacy tech trainee) at $10/hr and when I left a year and a half later, I was almost at $15.11 with the title Lead Technician and Inventory Specialist. My store manager was chaos though. So glad I didn't work up front. Overall, I'd say your quality of job is going to just depend on the store you get placed into. They are all slightly different."
good,"This Job is great, But management and team have a big impact on the culture. Most locations Ive worked in were great but one, make sure to check out team ethic, and customers experiences at the job site you're applying for."
good,"The company is enjoyable to work at from a personal fulfillment standpoint. However the pay could not support a household even at full time, which was unfortunate."
good,"A  major part of our position is to help people on their path to better help, just not sure if our method is the best way to help. I do not see myself getting the opportunity to grow with the company and feel that we are not compensated enough for what CVS expects from us."
good,"CVS has limited job growth and limited raises, You have to be friendly and patient, as well as fast and efficient, Managers can be amazing and occasionally buy you free lunch, Most of the time there is no breaks besides your lunch because the pharmacy is always busy, but there are times when you can take very few breaks. Sometimes the front store manager mess up your hours and are payed few than what your suppose to. The pharmacy manager is the only reason why i stayed so long because they are amazing and friendly and worth working for."
good,CVS/Pharmacy provides a great opportunity for individuals interested in working in healthcare. It is a great place to gain experience for those who are pursuing a career in the medical field.
good,"when i first started working there it was okay, everyone helped me as much as they could and i picked everything up pretty quickly. working in a fast [aced place isn't for every body, but i have tried to keep up and have gained a lot of knowledge. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with how many tasks that have to be done on top of every body that comes in and drops off prescriptions. The most enjoyable is my coworkers and how we can be a team and do so much together"
good,"I loved the customer service part of my job, however, stocking the shelves wasn't much fun.   I didn't mind checking in the vendors nor ""fronting"" and cleaning the store."
good,"I found that CVS was more about the score card than they were about the patient. When saying that I do not mean that they did not care about the patient, I simply mean they seemed more concerned with numbers and whether you used their method over how was the experience for the patient."
good,"overall work environment was good.  No room for advancement, during my time there company was being restructured and I was laid off, they did not offer a lateral move."
good,"Although this place can get hectic, it is a great place to learn team work and time management. You are not only responsible for the medications placed to order but you are also responsible for a persons life. Every bottle of medication is a person that you are helping into a better and healthier life."
good,Lage company with many great people to work with.  Great culture and good managment that makes you actually enjoy your job. Would recommend this employer to others.
good,Genuinely a good job to have whether part time or a career choice.  Salary can be a bit higher but still enough.  Always busy so shifts fly by.  Must be able to adapt to changes in state laws regarding certain medications.
good,"Fast paced environment, company that provides a great deal of information for analyzing your pharmacy practice. A great place for people looking to advance in retail pharmacy."
good,"Worked as an intern.  Spent three weeks at the store helping with routine pharmacy practices.  For the most part, I filled scripts with the occasional patient calls.  The experience was part of a school requirement."
good,"I learned a lot while there. The people was very helpful and understanding; the job was easy and worth going back and forth to,I honestly missing working there."
good,"I had a great 27 year career at CVS. my experience was excellent. have been gone for 7 years now, much has changed. business used to be more driven by talent in the field. now management is far more corporate driven. the company now ""manages to the exception"" does not look at the long haul picture. still overall a great place for someone to settle in for a career. Huge company with many pieces and opportunities to grwo"
good,"Can be kind of stressful depending on who is working. Some people I work with do not get stressed out over little things others make a big deal over nothing."
good,"I did not work there for to long so I can not really give a review, the supervisor was amazing to work with and the people was great as well. the company moved."
good,this company is great in the aspect of working well with your school and personal schedule. its a fast paced environment so time goes by quickly. the only thing that isn't great is the starting pay for a technician compared to its competitors
good,As a pharmacy technician I had a lot of stress for the amount of pay. I was on my feet for 6-8 straight hours with very little break time. There are (rightfully so) many regulations involved with the job. Our unit was in a very heavily bilingual area and the pharmacy staff only spoke English. This does not really serve the patients who speak other languages.
good,"Typical day at work consists of typing and filling prescriptions and customer service. I have learned a lot with CVS as far as how to be a pharmacy technician, insurance issues, customer service in a health care industry. Hardest part of the job is being short staffed as many CVS stores are."
good,"I m in my last year of high school and will be going onto college.  I m looking for either a weekend position or after school. Open for holidays as well, as I need to save for college."
good,The work environment is great because of the laid back mentality of some managers. Requires to meet tasks in a timely manner and perform tasks with great attention to detail.
good,I've learned very much over the past 2 years and met many great people. The management puts a lot of weight on their statistics; more than the happiness and ease of life of their employees which is a major downside. There also aren't any team building events like other big companies. Overall not terrible but not great.
good,The job in itself is fulfilling a typical day at CVS is pretty easy going however it does have some difficult parts just like any job. communication is key is this position you have to be aware of your surroundings and laws. The only real downfall to working at cvs would be the pay. the patients and building those relationships are a great asset to why you would want to move forward with the company. as a young women growing in life I would like to work for a company that compensates there employees based on there skill level and there ambition and genuine care thanks.
good,"Training is not the best and people hold on to a lot of their knowledge  Moving up is extremely difficult since Senior Level positions are filled."
good,Great part time position for students who are looking to learn pharmacology and advance into medicine. Not so great a place to work full time with no plans for the future.
good,Love my job as a pharmacy tech but at cvs the benefits is terrible & pay rate is a joke for the work the want us to do. Cvs is always having pharmacist & techs quitting.
good,Very physical some long hours easy work once you get a hang of it. Good money some good people very helpful when you need help. Help to advance to different places in the company
good,"The pay is not worth the work that is expected. We are constantly short staffed which causes a stressful environment, on top of getting hours cut often."
good,"I do not have any major complaints about the company as far as culture and management go, I do feel that corporate makes the pharmacy the number one priority regardless of sales or volume at any location. It never feels like there is enough time in the day to get all of the work done."
good,"A typical day at CVS in  the Pharmacy was very fast, from the time you get in at 8am to the time you leave at 3pm you are always busy helping patients. What I learned at CVS was definitely customer service skills and everything that goes on in the Pharmacy. Management was always on the ball also, in the Pharmacy your manager is the Pharmacist, I do give them good credit for all that they do but that also meant that they were usually very crabby. The hardest part of the job was working drop off where you were pretty much the patient's ""go-to"" for any problem they had, weather it was insurance, prescriptions not being ready, or that their prescription was wrong, that station is usually also on the phone all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was counting the pills and getting the prescriptions ready for the patients."
good,I have learned how to work more efficiently and how to provide exceptional care to patients. Manager worked hard to please hour expectations and to improve as a whole team as well as work with individuals performance. Hardest part about the job was learning everything you needed to know to become certified. The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling that you were improving patients health and even go to know some patients on a more personal level.
good,"Fast past sometime stressful environment, but with great management team make thing less stress and fun. Was great place to work, great co-workers."
good,Worked as a pharmacy assistant during nursing school it was a great way to learn the drug names and practice discussing them with patients. They were flexible with my schedule
good,"it is a good place to work in. i had a good experience working in my district the only negative is that i have to drive more than 3 hours every day, it is a very big district and most of the time they need help outside my home store"
good,The work place is very customer centered as you would expect in retail MY ORIGINAL MANAGER was awesome he went out of his way to help any of his employees the staff was very close knit there was no shortage of work to do the worst part was having to do either the vitamin section or first aid section the best part was my team
good,"My position consisted of me working as a clerk, cashier and customer service representative.  Each day I would have different positions to take care of, such as using the register, stocking items, cleaning, and assisting customers with various needs.  The management is well handled, supportive and incredibly friendly, and the environment is acceptable.  The most difficult aspect of the job was trying to please every customer as possible, while the most enjoyable aspect was being social with customers and giving them a wonderful everlasting impression."
good,"I like my job and responsibilities with CVS, the hardest part of the job is to handle difficult customers and provide them their desired products or items. "
good,"Pharmacy is always busy, customers are rude. Pharmacy employees get along and work together very good. Upper management allways help if needed."
good,Working with patients that have rare and terminal diseases is a rewarding job.   It is a large company with room for growth.
good,Great supervisors and a steady workflow. Flexible hours with room for change. Store transfers available if needed to change locations even to a different state. The learning and training never stops. Retail and pharmacy billing experience.
good,A lot of changes have occurred over the last ten years. The changes have resulted in many unhappy workers and pharmacists quitting. It resulted in a change of major for me.
good,"It's a call-center... be ready to answer the phone as soon as you sit down. Most calls are back to back and the pace is very fast and can be stressful at times. Management is not very helpful, and those that are... are swamped. Eventually worked from home... and this I LOVED. I was let go for personal reasons but I would go back if asked."
good,CVS Pharmacy was a good place to work at. Most of the store follow the same guidelines. Management is flexible with the hours you work and they will work with you if you need a day off. Good benefits. Full/part time positions available.
good,I had an awesome team that I worked with and I learned a lot from the company. My supervisor was a very hard worker and she made sure our team was on top of things and we got treated fair.
good,I assisted 52 branches of Coram throughout the US.  I worked with Alpha One patient files.  We began and finished the process for approval for a life long therapy.
good,"great job for those with good communication skills."
good,"Taco Bell was my very first job I've ever had. This is where I learned the true value of a dollar. I've had customers come in and would have their order memorized- which entailed great customer service on my behalf. I've learned to be patient the customers in the dining hall who would leave messes behind. I enjoyed when families, couples, friends would come in and dine in."
good,"El trabajo es muy emocionante porque siempre aprendes algo y tienes siempre algo nuevo que aprender y debes ser capaz de tomar decisiones y resolver problemas."
good,It  was  one  of  the  nicer  places  I've  worked.   They  really  worked  with  me  on  my schedule.  I  met  some  good  people  while  there at  CVS.
good,"It's hard to retain career employees with mismanagement and a broken chain of command, but from the corporate side benefits are wonderful and job advancement as well."
good,Working at Omnicare is a whole new experience for me. My day consists of searching for Insurance or a Med D plan for people who have no insurance on file and checking to see if people who applied for Medicaid were approved.
good,As a Student intern this eas a great environment to be working and learning in. The employees and the customers were all great people to work work with.
good,"Working at CVS Pharmacy helped me a lot expand my horizons in the pharmacy world, I learned a lot from everyone around me varying from store manager, pharmacists and even patients. The hardest part about the job is adjusting to the patients and their needs, some may be very hard to work with, but that is the beauty within it, finding a way to cooperate with even the hardest of hardships."
good,"Overall, I good environment to work for especially if you just want something part time if you have a family or other obligations"
good,"Everyday you process refills and new prescriptions. Depending on location some retail pharmacies are much busier than this location, but there is a steady flow."
good,This job was a very fast pace job. The pharmacy was a really busy one who had a lot of customers. Working there was very fun and I learned a lot of things.
good,"A good place to work-they do hire ALOT of part time people so very hard to get full time hours.  The computer system was very easy to learn.  Co-workers were super nice and helpful at my location, still friends with most."
good,At CVS everyday was a different challenge to face. Most of the work is working with your co-workers. The hardest part of the job is keeping a fast pace and not mispicking.
good,"Greets, instructs, directs and schedules patients and family members.  Work with all patients to schedule appointments that best meet their needs.  Assist patients with the selection of a primary care clinician stressing the importance of continuity with a primary care clinician. Handle prescription requests, medical chart information, schedule referrals with other physician offices and ensure that insurance referrals are made if required.  Answers the telephone and directs calls to the appropriate party. Collect co-payments and deductibles at the time of service and accurately posting CPT and ICD-9 codes and their associated charges and payments in the computer; balancing same with the computer printout at the end of the day and preparing the daily deposit."
good,"Never had time to get to know my customers, was always asked to do relief work at various stores. Was able to work part time."
good,C&S Was good to work for. It taught me to how follow times and care plans and risk assessments. Also how to be around different people.
good,"The project I was involved is for a merger. Typical day at work involves meeting for migrating applications from previous environment to CVS environment. Which involves testing the applications on virtual machines, create packages physical or virtual applications and have them test it with SME."
good,"I worked for a Brand new Store located in Forest Hills, New York. I love working for this company, but they did not have enough hours to give employees. They are willing to work with your schedule and most of management was very kind to employees."
good,"It is a nice place to work at, especially when you have no training at all they are there to walk you through everything step by step."
good,"Decent work environment for a self motivated individual. Management cares greatly about numbers and figures ans don't always take the time to assist in assuring employees make the ""quota"". Flexible with schedules as long as you can work with their guidelines. Employees themselves are friendly and welcoming and more than willing to help. Opportunities for advancement are few and far between."
good,"Great management. Work environment is chaotic. "
good,"Good company to work for if you can get the hours and benefits to become full-time employee.  They would rather work people more part-time than full-time.  They crunch numbers more than work efficiently.  Corporate cuts too many hours, therefore, leaving many employees with less hours and less money to be able to pay for bills.  Many employees are not trained properly and pharmacies are not run efficiently due to shortage of trainees being worked."
good,"A typical day started for me at 7:30am opening with the Pharmacist. And from that moment moving forward we didn't stop with one task being piled on the other. I loved my management, because they saw I was will to go above and beyond to gain as much knowledge as I could and they were more than happy to teach above the normal skillset. My co-workers were very tight knit. I could count on them to do their job proficiently without me having to babysit them. I would say the hardest part of the job was dealing with older patients who couldn't afford their medications and there was nothing I could to help them. Most rewarding part of the was truly being out there making a difference is peoples lives. All It takes is a genuine smile and concern to turn an entire situation around."
good,"The work was fine but very hectic. Even though we had a good team we still faced a lot of challenges due to budget limitations"
good,"Whether you are opening or closing, your day is never dull. There is not much down time as there is always something to do in the Pharmacy. Getting to know the regulars who come into the Pharmacy is very enjoyable, you feel a part of their way to better health."
good,"pays well, long days, nice co-workers.typical high volume stores with high demand for customer service. multitask and micromanagement of inexperience pharmacy technicians required. pharmacist  are hard working, my primary duty to quality assurance and to provide patient care."
good,"Great place to work, great staff strong company ethics, very minimum turnover. Training is one of the very low point of getting your work expected of you done."
good,I start my day by cleaning up any mess that is left from the other shift. the I log in my first assignment and begin to pick it. for instance. 401 1-d which is scope large size green bottle. my paper says that I need two in the tote. I get two and go onto the next item. the hardest part of the job is trying to keep everyone on the same number of work. that way no one is behind and no one is ahead. to make sure that everything can go out at the same time. the best part of the day is when everything is going right and there is no kinks in our day. if everyone works together and makes it a easy day
good,You will requires a lot of hard work and it is indeed a very highly motivated work environment.  You will learn a lot and prepare yourself for a good career
good,"the job was easy to obtain they kept the environment of the job easy to work in and adapt to our work area/desk was very comfortable, it was fairly easy to move up in the company. Management was maybe my least favorite thing working here with cvs health they seemed very impersonal, it was very hard to get coworker to feel like family/friends there was really no coming together on working our files down to holiday potlucks."
good,"You're always working by yourself; helping customers, stocking and cleaning the store. You have to be very flexible in all of your duties and move at a high pace."
good,"Good customer base.  Different challenges each day.  Teamwork among co-workers.  Clean, safe store.  Opportunity for advancement with paid training.  Cross-training available within store."
good,"Learned office products "
good,"This company is great company to work for, but not for your career advancement and long term goals you have planned for your future."
good,The pay wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. The challenges were there and I liked it. My crew was very good. As far as my customer service goes I was excellent.
good,This was my favorite customer service job. It allowed me to improve myself as an individual and improve my work ethic while working with all kinds of customers and interesting managers. This was also my first job where I was able to reap rewards with my progress as I moved up in the workplace.
good,Work hard a good excellent worker stay on time and stay focuse all about her work and wanna get to the next level of being successful.
good,One the best jobs i have ever had. the management was absolutely amazing. always put their employees first. always worked in teams everyone was always willing to help each other.
good,Loved working here.  Great opportunities for advancement. Can be extremely stressful though. Coworkers are great as well as benefits.
good,"A day at CVS consist of, answering phones, ringing customers, helping them find items that they need. A lot of running around. Co-workers and management are easy to get along with. As a new comer they usually will guide you to do whats right to get the job done. The hardest part may be, keeping your cool with a customer that is very upset about a situation."
good,"•	Knowledge of EMR/EHR with experience in Allscripts."
good,"Prior Authorization rep, Pharmacy Technician. Answered phone calls from Doctors offices. Trained new Reps, Managers and Pharmacists. Learned 3 different systems."
good,"I learned plenty of medical terminology and pharmacology working here at CVS. The pharmacists and pharmacy technicians expect fast-paced associates because of the high customer volume we had. Not only should we provide excellent service to our customers by being efficient and have their prescriptions ready as quickly as possible, the attention to detail is critical here. The detail ranges from updating drug manufacturers, switching from generic to brand-name per customer request, making sure our seniors have easy-to-open capped bottles, insurance updates and inventory to name a few. Other essential details are with the customer and interpersonal skills are required to gain their trust and confidence in us. The hardest part of the job is to keep up with the diverse personalities and characters we encounter during the day but despite the rollercoaster moods of these customers, the best and most enjoyable part of the job is when they appreciate us in the end for our service."
good,A typical day of work mostly involves filling prescriptions and ringing customers out. There is a decent amount of downtime but even that is used for cleaning or inventory. Staff is decent and though every group has their difficult ones the team isn't bad.
good,"Basically acquired customer service experience while addressing any concerns with problem solving"
good,"very busy"
good,"I learned a lot but my position was temporary.  We answered phone calls, and directed customers down the correct path for broken printers, and faulty scanners.  There was an article for everything, and that's how every problem was solved."
good,"I would log in on my computer at the beginning of my shift.  We had to log out for breaks and lunch.  All calls were recorded and reviewed.  I worked ten hour days."
good,"A typical day is answering 50-70 calls from member with questions about their pharmacy benefits, and taking refill prescription orders."
good,I come into work and am immediately put into one spot instead of rotating. I have learned to multi task. Management doesn't take care of any issues they push them off. My co-workers are not willing to help cover open shifts. The hardest part is a language barrier with the Spanish.
good,The job was actually cool. They have extended the hand out to me to come back and work but I haven't gotten back with them. But the fact that I was able to grow within the company was definitely a plus.
good,Fast pace and fun workplace. Hardest part of the job was to give every customer special custom care while meeting or exceed company's requirements calls.
good,"Smistamento del materiale bancario da lavorare e collaborazione con le altre colleghe per procedere alla giornata lavorativa. Lavorazione di riba cartacea, riba magnetica, cambiali di proprieta' e protestati.Stampe giornaliere ed imbustamento del materiale per essere spedito."
good,One of the busiest store in the area. The production of the pharmacy is non stop. Friendly and very helpful employee. Since its a busy retail store it requires a lot of standing most of the time. We enjoy serving the customer and seeing happy and satisfied customer.
good,"daily you see pretty much the same patience/customers. very family oriented, easy to climb career ladder. it was a delight to work for this company"
good,A typical day at work consisted of a lot of phone calls and being yelled at by some clients. I learned how to manage to different accounts. Management was not always the best. Some to majority of my co-workers were pleasant to work with. The hardest part of the job was learning the system. The most enjoyable was being able to help other with their medical needs.
good,"Busy place to work, always learning something new. Great experience working in the health care field. Never short of hours."
good,"As an employee, I was treated well by my coworkers and managers. However, the customer service aspect was very difficult because customers are not always patient. The terminology took a while to get used to and it creates an environment of constant learning."
good,"Fast pace atmosphere where multitasking is definitely second nature. Everyday is a learning process, since new drugs are rapidly being introduced."
good,"It is a good job, staff is great. You will learn alot such as how to adjudicate Rx's, and learn what different Rx's are for."
good,"Be prepared to multi-task, and have pressure to get things done. Must be a self-motivated individual to excel at the job. Management and staff are very accommodating; work well together to get things done. Most times working individually with one manager on shift is common, however days of inventory and stocking include almost all staff, and team collaboration is needed. Routine-functioning is crucial for this job position."
good,"Working in CVS for past 2 years and one of the fun place to work with secured job."
good,I do not feel like answering this question. I think that the pay is low for the work and knowledge that is required for some of the staff.
good,days were very different at cvs which included work change and duties. I learned to use a shrink wrap machine also how to stack a pallet properly
good,"-Filling prescriptions in a timely manner as well as accurately"
good,"I think working hours are not great for me, can't talk while you working work with moving belt co-workers are great lunch & break are great"
good,"This job was a big change from being a workers comp examine. I lost my job in the recession because with everybody being unemployed we became unemployed as well.  I decided to stay busy on a plan B so I went to pharmacy technician school because there seemed to be a lot of work in Tampa for that type a job. Even though the money was minimal, the work was far less stressful than my previous career. Omnicare was a good place to work. You didn't have to worry about  making a $200,000 mistake. The work was done at the end of the day."
good,I have customer service experience so mixing science and retail skills took me much further than I had imagined.  I made some very good friends here and know many of my customers on a first/last name basis.  I enjoy taking on challenges and know the need to multitask in this type of environment.
good,"Great place to work, busy and days go by fast, never boring, intense and challenging yet extremely satisfying. I love to help people and I have the pleasure of doing this daily."
good,"This job enables me to find and understand the needs of my patients, and to offer solutions that may help them. This job requires me to pay attention to detail, one mistake from me or any of my associates could directly impact the health of a patient.  This job has helped me understand the importance of having a relationship with my customers and has taught me that every detail matters."
good,"CVS does a great job of retaining employees, and encouraging advancement and growth within the company.Great place to work if you are young and looking for an opportunity to grow within a company"
good,"Working for a company which I grew up with was very rewarding,good benefits and"
good,"I loved the on the job training and the willingness for management to help with studying for certification. Daily tasks were easy. I wished the hours more flexible, but overall, a great place to work."
good,"The people are very nice at Coram Infusion Services. Work was good, very busy place.Enjoyed learning the hands-on experience of Medical Billing vs in the Classrom. Realized that Medical Billing & Coding are very important, in many different applications. Example not just clinical, or hospital, but in home services, also. Enjoyed the daily meetings to keep people updated on upcoming events, and current events, appreciated to be kept in the loop. Supervisors were well informed, and shared information. Pot-lucks were a nice surprise, good variety of great ethnic foods from all over the world."
good,"i loved this job until i get very sick and got fired after too much callouts, i loved serving the customers. very busy work environment, extensive training."
good,The company was great to me. The co-workers were awesome and the pharmacist was the coolest. Hardest part about my job was explaining insurance problems to customers.
good,Typical day is just checking out items and any other tasks the manager assigns. Many of the days would be easy and steady. Don't expect much of a raise tho.
good,"Call Center environment.  Process prescriptions and utilize computer programs.  Research accounts, answer questions, and work with new customers and other technicians and pharmacists. Assess client needs and recommend appropriate modifications. Develop credibility and confidence with customers. Answer and direct general calls. Perform all aspects of customer service and satisfaction, including answering busy multi-line phone system, coordinating special promotions, and providing detailed information for various requirements per DEA regulations.  Primarily responsible for Controlled Substance compliance, distribution, and working with a high call volumes while multitasking data entry for Long Term Care Facilities and Acute Care Facilities.  Filed and numerically organize prescriptions, make outbound calls to physician offices for clarification and compliance.  Other duties as assigned and learning and taking on more than job description."
good,This is a fun place to work most of the time.  Many of the customers have been going there for years so you get to know them and its fun.  There are limited benefits and it is hard to work more than one job while working there.
good,Supportive management and well balanced team. Able to be independent as well as make my own decsions and still be productive
good,"A self-defined health care company means CVS is a pioneer, and an exciting place to test market-leading advancements."
good,"Greeting customers and receiving written prescriptions or refill request"
good,CVS is an excellent company which is doing very well in it's field. It is a mover and shake in it's industry and in the world.
good,"I love the variety of people I get to work with at Coram.  It is a culturally diverse company who knows how to do home infusion really well.  They are always working on improving delivery of care and they go the extra mile for their patients.  The most enjoyable part of my day is knowing that I did a good job, and that my patients feel cared for.  I am never bored, and I love the variety of patients we serve.  I care for patients from ages 1 month to 98."
good,"I loved working here. I loved my manager and the people I was working with, we all had relationships with each other and we always had fun."
good,"The group in which I worked was great and provided a  high level of visibility to  every aspect of the enterprise. There is quite a bit of red tape, as it is a Fortune 10 company. Numbers and performance driven."
good,"I love working for this company! There is always room for improvement and advancement. I have never had a problem with any of my coworkers, and management is usually pretty good about working with you for things such as other employments, appointments, ect."
good,"-> work life balance is maintained"
good,"Some managers were excellent while others needed improvement. Hours were decent but the hourly pay was detestable for NYC, as is expected when working without a Bachelor's Degree."
good,"I do sale signs, stocking, help in the photo lab, do passport photos, organize the shelves, work the register, and help  customers find what they are searching for. I enjoy working here, but I do not enjoy being on my feet all day and the low pay. I've learned how to multitask and do it effectively."
good,filled prescription meds everyday and entered medication information into the computers. answered phone calls and dealt with insurance quit often.
good,"very good atmosphere to work, friendly environment and flexible timings, my co-worker are very friendly, very good scope to learn new technologies"
good,"Typical day:Helping customers feel better with a smile and positive words"
good,"pay isn't very competitive but it's a great place to work because I like the people I work with and the customers aren't so bad in the store. They're just unaware of how things works so I show them what to do. The downside is that there aren't many opportunities to work up or pay increases. But that's perhaps more of the fact that minimum wage sucks in the US rather than CVS not paying enough, although they could set a precedent for increasing the minimum wage by paying more."
good,"CVS Health is a company that is paving the way for pharmacies to become a true extension of our healthcare system. "
good,"I think CVS is a wonderful company to work for. They seem to care a lot about their employees and promotes and environment of all inclusiveness, that's rare in corporate America and commendable. There is also a lot of promotion potential and different areas to explore. Depending on the position you have, the option of working from home on a full or part time basis is available. "
good,It's a packed day of work: Opening financials ...daily price changes....cycle counts on inventory....payroll...scheduling ...daily work load planning....vendor management....ordering...inmore detail on resime.
good,"Fantastic people to work with and a very high quality clinical team.  It was a real pleasure to work with them and provide the highest level of care.  Management was poor, however, rather weak and much more often than not unwilling to make hard decisions and/or see them through."
good,It was fun to work there and after getting into the swing of it I'd have 3 hours if not more with nothing to do because I had already gone beyond my normal responsibilities. However being tossed around to different shifts when you primarily work 3rd shift is not fun and for that  I give a lower rating otherwise friendly and fun.
good,makina ağırlıklı bir firma olduğu için inşaat biraz daha 2. planda bırakıyorlar
good,place was ok to work for.. felt like most of the time people who been working there for quite some time got better treatment then others. very fast past and made time go quick. that's the best part about that job.. plus the people that I worked with were very respectful and helped out when we needed it.
good,"a typical day goes as following, I go into work and immediately i am sent to production, which is the station where the pills are counted. I am the tech that counts the meds fastest so I am sent to fill the meds, the tech where i will go is moved to register checkout. When the lead tech leaves the pharmacist will take over verifying and counting the meds and I will be sent to prescription entry station, know as Drop-Off. One must be fast in this because if you go slow or can't handle insurances, your day will get backed up because the prescriptions are just building up."
good,"On a typical day going into work it's actually quite frustrating to try and get my work done. The company has cut down hours and therefore we are short on help some days. I juggle between two different jobs, sometimes three, when I go in on some shifts. I try to get everything in my department done first, while juggling being the backup cashier, and then try to complete the tasks on the sales floor that management gives me. The managers I work for are the best, I must say. My boss is very laid back as long as everyone is doing what they're supposed to be doing and he's very flexible and understanding. My supervisors are the same way which creates a relaxed work environment when I'm not running around doing several things at once. My co-workers are great and there isn't a single person in the store that I dislike. I get along with everyone and have become close to many of them over the years. They are the best part of my job. The lack of hours comes from higher up and it's become more frustrating to me over the past year. It's the one downfall of working to this company."
good,At the pharmacy I work we always steady. I've learn to keep to my shut and ears open to learn more. Sometimes it can be a strain on you because there is always somebody calling in and that makes more work for you to do if you can handle the pressure. And by me being the only male tech. more is expected from me.
good,"I start my day with a smile at 0700, when the first customer walks through the front door.I get to help my customers each and every minute of the day whether they are trying to use the picture kiosks and are getting frustrated with the machine, I will take the time to sit and help them through it so they will be able to do it themselves the next time.  I learn so much from my customers that way.  My one customer she really seemed rude to another coworker of mine, but when I sat with her to help her with the kiosk, I found out she had just come from her sister's apartment because her sister had just passed away 2 days before.  she was trying to get photos for the funeral.  The more I sat with her, the more relaxed she became, and I was apart of that moment.  That is what I love about CVS.  its not just about saying hello to your customer when they walk through the door.  It is connection is a way that will help them to feel better about there day.The hardest part of my job is picking up the slack of other employees.  I like to work and earn my pay check others seem to think it is ok to sit and relax and just be for there 8hrs.  I am a hard worker to the core.  I give 110% of myself to everything that I do."
good,Awesome management that will work with you and are all very nice people!! If you are able to sit all day it is a great place to work. They have reasonable quotas that are not hard to meet.
good,"Customer friendly with patients at the Pick Up and Drop Off counters"
good,"It was a fun work environment with energetic and positive people. Management was relaxed and understood a student's schedule and easily made accommodations. Of course customer service is a taxing position and requires a lot of patience, so it is not a job I would like to stay in. Minimum wage is no fun either."
good,"I learned a lot over the years working for this company."
good,Assisted in training all types of people country wide.  Project has finished and working has become more of a cleanup effort than a project in training and coordinating.
good,"great place to work, good manager, down to earth employees, over all good place to work, only downside they did not hire/promote from within."
good,it was a fun place to work meet alot of new people learned alot of new stuff
good,"Great first job! Had a blast with my co-workers and loved them all! Customers, like them all, could be ridiculous at times, but it was worth it!"
good,CVS is a great place to work as a first job. although it seems upper management is a bit slow to get things done. the hours are flexible and the staff is fun. this job however is not a career.
good,Working in the pharmacy is a great experience. The people I work with are hard working and do everything they can to help the patents we see.
good,"I enjoy working at this company. Fast pace, high energy on a daily basis.  This company provides endless oppertunity if you are willing to work hard. The company is rapidly growing,"
good,"A high volume retail pharmacy focusing on serving the community. Adjudicate insurance claims, enter and fill new prescriptions, order and maintain inventory levels of prescriptions and OTC medications."
good,It was my first job as a technician.  I only worked here every other Saturday for a year. My manger was nice. I twas a small pharmacy but it was a great place to finesse my skills as a technician.
good,"Overall it is a pleasant working environment and training is provided from day one. The hardest part of the job is that it never closes  but that is the life of retail."
good,"That is the gist of it: somehow they succeed in assembling great clinicians - pharmacists, registered dietitian nutritionists, and nurses - and others who provide fantastic clinical services to very ill patients.  However, so very much could be done SO much more efficiently if parts of the division were very differently run."
good,"Overall CVS/Caremark was a nice place to work. The team I worked with was a great group of people and my work needs were always met in a timely manner, i.e. (requests granted to take PTO), etc."
good,I have been able to perfect my customer service skills and feel I am making an impact on patient care.
good,A typical day for me entails quality assurance with verifying prescriptions for accuracy and safety.  I work at a high-volume store and the biggest challenge is managing workflow to deliver medications in a timely manner.  The staff is courteous and professional leading to great service. I enjoy serving the community and interacting with patients.
good,"Extremely busy, good coworkers, great location, the hardest part of the job is learning everything inside and out about different insurance information to submit based on the card given to you."
good,I like working at CVS. I meet a lot of people and enjoy the atmosphere. This Job taught me a lot the last few years. Just wish there more oppurtunities to go higher with in the company!
good,"CVS is a great place to work and advancement opportunities are around the corner.  I truly enjoyed a typical day working for them and hopes in possibly returning to them later in future.  The only complaint I have is the pay.  It isn't great at all.  Other than this, I don't have any complaints."
good,I gained experience in different areas of pharmacy. Always opportunity for overtime. Growing company.
good,"Data entry- Entering new patients into the system, entering their medications, entering doctors and nurses orders so the medications could get out in a timely manor."
good,"nothing to say"
good,Help desk setting in a team environment call center. Management working with employees to meet common goal of high customer service
good,"At CVS as a pharmacy technician I am required to be my pharmacists ""right hand"". Since they are busy verifying prescriptions and speaking directly with doctors I do most of the direct interaction with the patients unless they need direct consultation from the pharmacist. At CVS I learned how to not only think fast, manage my time between data entry,production and the register, but how to create relationships with customers so that they not only wanted to get their prescriptions and leave, but they also looked forward to seeing me. Being at a small store I work one on one with the pharmacist, they have both become almost family to me. The hardest part abut running a pharmacy with four stations with two people is not being able to be two places at once. This hardship facilitated my face-paced work ethic. It was imperative that although we were under-staffed sick, and tired patents were able to leave the pharmacy as quickly as possible. My data entry skilled improved drastically from this to the point where I get comments daily how quickly I type and navigate the computer system. When patients leave happy, and feeling better than when they arrived is the most enjoyable part of this job."
good,Nice place to work. Room for advancement. Nice atmosphere.
good,"A typical day at work consists of helping customers on their path to better health. What I've learned so far at CVS Pharmacy, is important communicative and leadership skills required to be part of a management team. The management at CVS strongly depends on location and the particular skills, knowledge and experience of the manager of the store. The hardest part of the job may be dealing with problematic or impatient customers, or worse shoplifters. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you were able to help a customer to the fullest extent and building a rapport with them."
good,"Busy, constantly moving around getting plenty of exercise, meeting and assiting a large number of interesting people."
good,"Helping customers, how to read and execute planograms, and work out seasonal. My co workers were great to work with."
good,"i loved the fact that i was able to aquire quite a bit of  knowledge working in the pharmacy, the stress of the job is very high because you have quite a lot of patients that require your services along with the pharmacist needing it as well..you have to have  great team work in order to have a pharmacy that works well, the one i worked in did not and was always there was always an issue"
good,"CVS Caremare is an amazing company. The compensation and benefits are great. The job experience is varaible depending on the store location. Customer Service is highly valued in the company and when one delievers likt the company wants, results are shown. The company ins't so hung up on personal image, they hire those that are original and creative. Management is sometimes hard to deal with as they are under high pressure to deliver results. The stress level can be high in an ill-managed store. THe most enjoyable aspect of the job are the Customers."
good,Not a bad place to work unfortunately i had to stope working due to school .
good,cvs is a great company to learn about pharmacy operations if you want to be a pharmacist
good,"Technicians at CVS are expected to run the show.  Greeting customers, entering prescriptions, filling, filing, answering phones, correcting insurance rejections, stocking shelves, organizing, completing customer transactions, return to stock, out of date checks, drive through, ordering, calling doctor's offices for follow up, calling patients regarding refills.  All of which are technician duties, and expectations, however when you have a staff of 3 technicians to a pharmacy processing over 400 daily it is simply exhausting and unrealistic."
good,"was good start and huge push up and great start for me"
good,"I decided to try my hand at a different aspect in life. CVS/Caremark was a great place to work. I had my own cubicle, computer, and personal space. I chose to end my job with CVS/Caremark to obtain my CDL."
good,Great learning center.  Gave me a good hands on experience especially in the IV Infusion Department
good,Busy some down time. Learned how to process returns n refunds. Management is okay. Great co workers. Hardest part of day was not being able to full fill all demands.. Most enjoyable part of my job was my co workers.
good,I did enjoy the environment and learning how to order and maintain our inventory.  I liked working with the customers and helping them understand their medicine.
good,"I would work either at a register or at a group of self checkout machines helping customers."
good,"I love the atmosphere here. The customers are nice, except the ones who yell at you for not knowing what kind of cigarettes they smoke 2/4 managers are lazy and brings personal life into the business where it affects the work place."
good,Work behind the counter and help people with any needs that they needed including cashiering from 4 pm - 12 midnight. Not hard at all as long as you did that and maintained the store.
good,"diversity with people.. caring for customers. management stressful, very demanding.. love to care for patients"
good,"Diverse product line with variety of insurance carriers.  Fast pace, professional atmosphere.  Colleagues and clients were most enjoyable part of the job.  Consistently being challenged was hard to come by at the job, would have enjoyed more research and advancement opportunities."
good,assisting with mail order prescriptions to see if plan covers the medication and further research
good,"Very demanding and intense work environment.  Good pay and benefits, but extremely long hours and rigorous standards to uphold."
good,Can be busy but the company will work with your schedule. Had a great time working with this company

good,Pull and pack orders in a timely manner non-stop. Loaded and unloaded 48ft. trucks with a pallet jack in a fast pace environment.
good,Going in to caremark i had not had previous call center experience but i quickly learned how to navigate through the systems in order to help my members that called in.I dealt with some irate members and escalated calls but in customer service you must learn to cope with that and learn how to make a bad day better. All my coworkers were friendly and i was greeted every morning at work.  i overall enjoyed working at caremark.
good,Not a stable compamy and not change or place to grow. Great Co-Workers and good management. When you are very good training the work is good.
good,"there's always something to do, ive been there for almost 8 years and I felt secured as long as you work hard and show the higher ups what your capable of then you will be just fine."
good,"I have the opportunity to meet many people and I love this part of my job. My co-workers are wonderful and make the job more enjoyable during busy or difficult times. The most difficult part of this job is being a cashier, customer service representative, and trying to keep the store straightened - all by myself. I have learned that a smile and a friendly ""how are you today"" can really make someone's day, though many people just look at me with a blank stare if I say that... People are not used to good customer service anymore, and this honestly makes me sad."
good,"Your day goes by pretty quickly, You start answering calls as soon as your shift starts. There is a lot of information to learn and new information comes up all the time, The management is upbeat and enthusiastic. The co-workers are friendly, encouraging and supportive. There are two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch, Adherence time is strict. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you are able to provide good customer care."
good,"A typical day is busy, constantly filling prescriptions and taking care of customers with very little down time.  This job has taught me time management and extreme multi-tasking.  Co-worker generally work well together at their stations to create a good flow.  The hardest part is when we get behind and have to twice as hard to catch along with trying to keep customers happy.  I enjoy the people I work with.  I also enjoy my regular customers and having developed that person acquaintance with them."
good,"CVS was a great place to work with nice and friendly customers.  I enjoyed working at this place, because I love helping people."
good,"fast pace "
good,Each day was very busy processing scripts for delivery. The best part of my day was delivering the prescriptions to the customers and meeting new people.
good,Excellent job. Great Benefits. Good experience in call center environment. Shift bids are fair.
good,CVS is a great place to work but little room for advancement...Typical day is fast paced with many demands.The hardest part of the joib is standing for hours with out any break. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping others
good,"mostly dealing with customers i also input third party insurance, prescrition data entry, medication production, and organaization."
good,"Coram is a national corporation and Knoxille is one of 3 TN branches.  We provided home infusion medication and supplies as ordered by md for patients to recieve in the home.  We provide education for patients and their caregivers about the medications and administration.  We also provided inservices for local HH nursing agencies that helped care for our patients.  Responsible for working with admissions personnel to obtain data on pt referrals and data entry into HCN clinical computer program.  Responsible for initial call to patient/caregiver to instruct on Corams services and pt responsibility.  Arranged HH Nursing when needed as we do no yet have a CON at this branch to provide nursing.  I performed daily 24 hr followup calls to newly admitted pts and 60 day assessment calls to our specialty patients. (cardiac, ivig, alpha 1 inhibitors, etc) .  We are a small branch with 8 employees.  The job could be stressful at times when many referrals came in at once but the work enviroment was laid back and informal.  When needed everyone pulled together as a team to get the job done.  Our branch manager tended to stay in the background but was there for us when needed.    My title was nursing supervisor but at the tme had no nurses directly under me due to the CON status.  One of the reasons for my job was the goal of obtaining the CON and opening an ambulatory infusion center later this year but this seemed to have stalled when Coram was recently bought by another large national pharmacy."
good,"- Input prescriptions written as physician orders from contracted nursing facilities."
good,I work at a 24 hour pharmacy that is always busy. Its fast-paced and you have to learn quickly but this puts you ahead of the competition when branching out. CVS pays for certification after first 6 month of employment
good,"Through CVS Pharmacy, I was able to succeed throughout my six years at MCPHS University due to being exposed to various medications, OTC counseling, and working directly with pharmacists. Furthermore, the experience allowed me to garner a better understanding of pharmacy with respect to the community setting. The management was easy to approach to with respect to various such as pay and vacation days. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with patients and helping them with respect to medication adherence, adverse effect mitigation, and helping them choose an OTC product with respect to their presented symptoms. The hardest part of the job excelling in insurance claims."
good,Was always a joy to be at work everyday. Good place for growth and development.
good,"Working at CVS Caremark is a wonderful place to work. The staff their is very committed to there new employees and helping them achieve their goals. As a new employee, I feel very comfortable approaching a member of management with questions I may have as a new employee in a corporate environment."
good,"I been working for CVS 10 years now, what i learned is that you take your day, 1 day at a time! i respect my customers and my co-workers. Everyday, I walk into CVS, not knowing whats going to happen. The hardest part about CVS is taking care of the customers, there are people that are mad and want their meds quick and then there's customers that are respectful and know we work hard to get their meds done!! I enjoy my job everyday, 24 hours a day, 365 days."
good,My co-workers are great people and make the day fly by. My supervisor really works with me and understands when something family related happens.
good,This is a great place to learn about the PBM industry.  CVS is like many other large corporations with red tape.
good,"Very busy environment and different from my career however provided with the ability to touch up on customer service skills. Enjoy working with the public and helping others in a retail environment. Hardest part of job is inability to control customers that are not happy with what is/isn't ""in stock"" within the store or items returned for refunds."
good,"Very busy and growing company.  Lots of room for upward movement.  Management has moved towards a front store oriented company instead of a pharmacy oriented company but I believe that is only temporary, after all it is a pharmacy and the pharmacy patients are what make our business."
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced. I work in one of the busiest stores in my district. You must understand time management, and proper procedures of working. Making sure to communicate with co-workers is crucial. In order to get the job done efficiently you must work as a team. The most rewarding part of this job is your customers happiness."
good,CVS Caremark is a great place to work. Some of the management lack professional leadership and professionalism.
good,"Like any job, you have your pros and cons. I love CVS I would recommend it to anyone on a job search. Co-workers make you feel at home, along with management. The hardest park of the job was not being able to help out everyone (financially struggling) most enjoyable part was knowing you could help people and how generous every satisfied customer was."
good,I loved my job as a pharmacy tech. and I loved working with the customers and people I loved knowing that I was doing a good job for the people and helping them in many way and learning new things about medicine and medical advancements.
good,A good solid company that provides knowledgeable  training for employees
good,very fast paced department which makes the day go quickly. lots of training provided by the company opportunity to advance. Co-workers were very temperamental some where only there to keep getting welfare checks and had no pride or concern with  they were doing. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers
good,Ability to review store daily through walk throughs and reporting. Resources to then react to build the business.
good,"Travelling around the area's of WestMoors, Ferndown and Dorset providing personal care and other tasks to clients within their own homes. I built many working relationships and found the job so rewarding in so many ways. I gained great trust and friendships within other members of staff working together to double up on the clients who needed it most. The hardest part of the job was not having a driving license so cycled to work and around my daily calls in all weather conditions. The most enjoyable part about the job was seeing the smiles on the faces of the people i helped."
good,"The employees are fun to work with, but the customers can be difficult and unsympathetic due to the fact that they are usually not feeling well. But I learned to handle all sorts of difficult customers,"
good,"Depending if you work in a high or low volume pharmacy, work can be enjoyable especially if you have a good staff.  I've had the pleasure of working in lots of different pharmacies within my district and have met very interesting people along the way. The hardest part of the job is when you work at a higher volume store and the pharmacy is understaffed.. so the pressure to get things done becomes overwhelming. The most enjoyable part of the day is when an issue is resolved and the patient is very thankful that you could help them get their necessary medication."
good,CVS is a great company to work for.  Plenty of career growth opprotunties.
good,"great entry level sales position, busy atmosphere, some/little experience in pharmacy"
good,Overall I like working for CVS Pharmacy. I absolutely love the people that I work with and I enjoy interacting with the customers as well. The hardest part of the job is there are so many small things that you have to worry about that you don't really spend as much time helping the customers as you would like.
good,A solid company with management that keeps projects under control.
good,"This job is great for anyone who loves working with people, whether you are behind the counter or out on the floor there is constant communication and contact with customers. Its amazing to see how much you can help someone out when they are looking for a product or have questions about their scripts or insurance. Cvs employees are a giant family. You get to know each other and care for each other. Management is great as well always trying to be helpful and very appreciative when they ahve a good worker. The worst part of things would probably be the lack of hours."
good,"The typical day at work is busy non stop for 98% of the day, which is one of the things that I like about the job. You learn to multi-task in a fast paced enviorment. The pharmacist manager is really laid back and fun going, so even after dealing with difficult customers all day, he still keeps a calm demeanor and laughs it off like I do. Most of my co-workers are really heplful and easy going, but like some jobs you have the co-workers that need a little guidance to push past the chaos that can occur in a fast paced workplace. The things that make the job great is the fast paced enviorment that I'm able to learn new things and identify more medications and there purpose."
good,"Running the registers, filling prescriptions, talking to customers on the phones and in store. My management was always helpful if anyone had a question or a problem, co-workers as well. The hardest part of the job was being able to keep up with the ""rushes"" during the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and creating a friendly environment for everyone."
good,"Most people rely on competent individuals to make their life easier.  Pharmacy is no different.  As a pharmacy technician everything must fall into place from the start to keep a good flow going to ensure the ""rights"" of the customer.  We all have to learn each duty that is expected of us corporately as well as customer related.  To keep the customers' needs met and exceeded we must work as a team and everyone having basic product knowledge stemming from experience and book learning.  We also must have individuals who truly care for another's well being.  This is why I chose my career and want to continue to showcase my empathetic nature in a professional setting."
good,"I started in the reports department with in 2 months I moved up to receptionist, then 10 months later I was promoted to the administrative assistant. I loved the company and the chance to advance so quickly but once i showed what I could do and what I had to offer the company I became very quickly over worked and hardly got to see my kids."
good,"Basically worked alone up at the front running the cash register, photo center, stocking merchandise, running ads. I learned how to process film. The hardest part of the job was having to run the store on your own although the manager was present most of the time they were in their office doing ""manager"" stuff."
good,My co-workers are enjoyable to work with. My supervisor always lends a helping and is also a team player.
good,"I have worked at this location for a little over a month now, and I like it. I work in the Medical Records department and the staff has been great!! My floor manager had been very helpful and he is always willing to make sure that I have a grip on my workload. He tries to boost employee morale. The atmosphere is very diverse in culture which I like. The department supervisor is helpful a well, but a little intimidating-meaning she is very.........stern? While she is very polite,I certainly do not want to ever see her bad side and I don't think she realizes how her words come across at times. But I like her she makes sure things get done and she went out her way to make sure that in starting I was comfortable. Over all I am glad I came to work here. Except for the bathrooms, which are gross....they scare me as well as some of the ill mannered employees in some of the other departments."
good,Start off in the stock room breaking down pallets. Then once all the stock is out go help out at the cash register..
good,Because of my excellent management team. I love going into work. My coworkers are fun and energetic. I have learned a ton of new skills. There is room to advance and grow with the company if you desire. Starting pay is less than mediocre but it is company policy to reward long term employment with raises.
good,"Very demanding , understaffed , not sufficient training time , learn as you go , experience perferred , I learned alot working here as far as how to work at a fast and demanding pace will keeping errors to a minimum. Constantly learning as new drugs were introduced as well brands and generic."
good,Lead casher for December of 2011. Helped to increase sales for the month of December. Learned more about the POS register.
good,"On a typical day I will do production, pick up, drop off, drive thru, and handle any basic drug questions or insurance complications. "
good,"I am a pharmacy floater. Each day i work, continue to learn. It's the slow time of the year and hrs are cut. I really like the job. Hope to fine a open spot as a tech."
good,"My day at work was always busy and enjoyable, i was a lead cashier, and always making sure our customers were well taken care of, my co workers were always there if any one needed help. "
good,"Typical day is checking out customers, stocking the floor front and processing picture orders effectively. I've learned a great deal of customer service and it has impacted my life since then. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of my job was a lack of communication from management. The most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction I shared with customers. "
good,"A very busy and uptempo environment that mildly limited me to be able to learn as much as I wanted. I still enjoyed the opportunity so I now know what environment to expect when I work in a retail environment. I worked in a Faced-paced environment; Strong customer service needed at all times; Answering incoming calls, pull outdated drugs, filling prescriptions, counting pills, printing labels, used Cardinal Inventory software for ordering drugs, changing NDC’s."
good,"•	Perform as a consultative resource to plan participants in need of assistance with clients prescription  benefit plan demonstrating behaviors that contribute to the department’s achievement of service level goals."

good,A typical day would be showing up for work greeting everyone with a smile. Get to my desk find out just what it is that's going on. What needs to be handled or any urgent matters.
good,Some days are easier to handle than others... The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure all the customers were satisfied with the services that we provide to them.
good,"Decent company to work for, they make changes to policy, procedure and store standards last minute. All employees are expected to be aware of changes the moment it happens however slow communication doesn't allow for this. Recent changes in labor hours put stores in a stranglehold to get any projects done in the time frame the company expects."
good,Some days can be crazy busy. Company has way to many training modules to complete after initial training. Company calls patients WAY too much.
good,"Waiting on customers in drive through,and at the counter. Typing prescriptions for drop offs, filing and filling prescriptions. Pulling drugs, and putting away drugs pulled for filing. Trouble shooting calls for customer's with insurance issues. Faxing requests for refills. I learned a lot about medications,and what they are used for to help people. After I was robbed while in the pharmacy by myself, it became hard to work there anymore, so I had to quit. I loved all my co-worker, we got along great. I got along so well with my pharmacy mgr. that we still talk from time to time."
good,A typical day at work consisted of making our clients our first priority. I learned that in healthcare it is impairative to make sure the customers are well taken care of due to the importance of the specialty medications they urgently needed. I enjoyed assuring the satisfaction of customers on a daily basis. With great management is was very easy to continue to put smiles on our customers faces. The hardest part of the job woulb be to see someone not giving their best to take care of the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that i succeeded in going the extra mile to take care of the customer. Even if it ran over into my luch 15 minutes. Their lives is more important than me eating a burger or juice for lunch. I was very grateful to have co-workers that were pleasant to work with. Thats a plus to working together to please our customers even more.
good,It was a great place to work with a great management team. I was only temporary staff but it is great job security for permanent employees.
good,"I never knew my work schedule until a day in advance usually or the same day. They seemed to have hired extra help they did not really need so work hours were few, not enough to really make it worth working there but for the needed experience and not having anything else to do."
good,"I work daily to fill prescriptions and handle clinical issues with my staff in a collaborative fashion. We have a great workflow and layout in the pharmacy in order to provide essential drug dispensing and information. We are faced with issues constantly and find a way to tackle them with effective communication and teamwork. I most enjoyable part of my day is getting the opportunity to train a colleague in any aspect of the CVS workflow and tasks. On the other hand, the job can be strenuous at times when there are staffing issues and during specific holidays in the year."
good,"I work mainly in Photo making sure all of the orders are completed in a timely manner. Multi- Tasking is a huge part of this position, because I am also providing customer service, and cashier along with the work that has to be completed. I enjoy working with the customers on the Kiosk making their pictures how ever they want them. I have fun working with my co-workers they are all extremely friendly and kind people."
good,A typical day at Cvs was pretty simple. There were alot of things to do on the to do list. I tried to get as much things done as i possibly could. Every week myself or whoever worked that shift would tear down the old ad and out up the new ad. I also checked out the customers in a timely and fashionable manner.
good,i enjoy working with my current co-workers and enjoy helping my customer/patients. will miss them greatly
good,A typical day at CVS/Pharmacy is busy at times but can be great.
good,* more than 200
good,"Reasonable benefits, some stress in the work environment, beneficial work, quality service orientation, limited advancement opportunities"
good,wonderful depending who you work with. I enjoyed my experience there but theres really no room for advancement.
good,"I worked for CVS/Pharmacy in the pharmacy department for about four years. A typical day included typing prescriptions, filling prescriptions, answering phones, and counseling patients about their prescriptions. I learned an enormous amount of information about prescription drugs and their effects. I always learned the values of customer service. The hardest part of the job was trying to manage doing so much at one time and the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help others."
good,Very different then where I have worked in the past. Gives me more experience under my belt.
good,1. Working with insurance companies and case managers
good,"While I only worked at CVS for a year, I did have enough experience there to learn several things. I had no knowledge how photo development worked until I had to operate the one-hour photo machine, as well as ring up the customers at the same time. It took some time to get accustomed to doing several things one after another, or even at once. I would sometimes be quickly running negatives through the machine or preparing rolls to be developed as a customer was looking through their purse or wallet. There were times when this took a toll on me and physically wore me out or gave me headaches. Most of my co-workers and managers were fun to work with, though exceptions did exist. However, I never actually had any real problems with any of them. The pace of the job was really the hardest part for me, and probably was a factor in my increased and more frequent headaches which caused my resignation. I did, however, enjoy working with most of my co-workers. They made the work go much more smoothly and boosted my morale."
good,"It's a small home health care agency, we have about 55 patients but I am the ONLY one running the whole office daily. I provide the billing for medicare and medicaid, PAS for the state, filing, scheduling for the nurses, payroll and doing typical office duties. I love the contact with staff personnel, patients, family members and physicians. I love to make sure patients are getting the max care that they need."
good,"It was only a temporary job. I was an extern and needed 120 hours of on job experience for a pharmacy technician class I was taking. Although I wasn't getting paid, I was still getting more hours than my paying job. It is a place I would like to get a paying job at."
good,"have worked for cvs for 7 years,really enjoy the customer interaction."
good,like family
good,I enjoyed working at CVS Caremark as a call center representative.
good,"fill prescriptions, paper work , take orders over the phone and walking ."
good,"Working for CVS is not always the easiest. Strong multi-tasking skills are a must as you are often the only person responsible for completing many different tasks while also maintaining excellent customer service as it is needed. Needed it is, most locations I have been in have a revolving counter of countless customers to be served and several more floating down the aisle with question to be answered."
good,"I have endured so much pain from leaving the B'ham facility you would not believe. First of all, I was one of the best top performers in the place as pharmacist, and all that worked there will tell you it is so, but because I walked off the job, I was stabbed in the back by the company and given a 'non-rehire' status, and was denied many similar jobs across the country due to the narrow-mindedness of this company's higher ups. And I have tried nearly everything legal to try to change this. What was even stranger was that my former Supervisor personally told me that she would give me a grand review, but I found out that she was not telling the whole truth and that I was not given a decent recommendation and it hurt my future in pharmacy immensely. What I even did was not that bad, but when you tell someone, ""he was a great employee up until the last day"" someone could easily assume the worst! It was a great place to work and initially I wanted to work my way up the leadership ladder, but when I saw that many capable RPhs could do it, I decided to just be a good follower and work the hardest I could. I became too much of a top performer and less of a socialite and a kiss booty type....lol, but no one complained, so, so what, right? Wrong! I learned that one must kiss 'it' to all up until your last day or your back will definitely get stabbed! Oh well, life goes on, just that it may be a different career or owning my own business in my future possibly."
good,"if you've been a courtesy clerk anywhere else before, you'll get the same thing here. stocking, register duties, horrible customers, and store maintenance."
good,"CVS is a very fast paced work place. You walk in and you don't stop working till you leave or get a lunch break.Time goes by really fast this way so i don't mind it. Although, it can be a bit stressful. I've learned alot about inventory working there, which (what Ive learned) is very important. I've always enjoyed everyone i work with , i learn to adapt to other peoples personalities.I think the hardest part of my job would probably have to be the over all stress, which i feel i am pretty good at handling. I always enjoy seeing our regular customers come in and call you by name just to say hi , that definitely makes me feel good to know i am recognized."
good,Fun co-workers and exciting customers
good,"I work on the Mirena project-a form of birth control for women, I'm a go to person on the floor if any co-worker needs help or a question answered. The best thing I like about my job is, work independently with minimal supervision and I like that I exceed in my job performance every day as what my manager/supervisor expects out of me."
good,"Great place to work, caters to the needs of their members. Competivite wages and benefits."
good,I enjoy working with people and providing a needed service to our community.
good,Great opportunities for advancement for employees with limited education and work experience. This company likes to promote from within. Great place to learn a new career due to their on-the-job training and continued education opportunities.
good,"My day at work would start out getting a forklift and being assigned to a door where a semi truck would pull into. After getting the door opened and checking the freight, I would use my forklift to remove the merchandise fromt he truck. I had lumpers who would breakdown the skids and seperate the merchandise onto different skids where I would receive it and give it a location for the put away department would put it away. We worked mainly on our own, but I could always rely on my co-workers and supervisiors for help if needed. The hardest part about my job was learning the forklift, totally different then driving a car. I really liked the people I worked with must of all. When needed we all came together as a team to get the job done."
good,"overall i enjoyed working at cvs, everyone was very helpful while i was learning their computer system. my experience there was positive."
good,"great place to work. clean stores, great customers. seasonal sets are fun. truck day is a team effort. lots of opportunity to advance."
good,"I start my day relieving the previous cashier. At the beginning of my graveyard shift check out is very busy. After things quiet down I shift to restocking, correcting misplaced product, cleaning, building end cap displays and returning go back products. I've have had an opportunity to be apart of an organization and experience what it takes to run this type of business looking up through all the layers. Store manager is strong and direct however sometimes not always are mistakes dealt with equitably. I have two differant shift managers who are total opposites. I blend with both. Hardest part of the job is cashiering while restocking. We are a 24 hour store so we have customers in varying numbers throughout the night. The most enjoyable is solving a customers urgent or nonurgent needs."
good,Manage the pharmacy with a staff of 8 technicians. Very busy work schedule with no time for lunch.
good,Not very consistant when it comes to the hand book rules and policies.
good,Omnicare is a good company to work for. benefits are excellent. company has made improvement in changing customer relationships.
good,"on a typical day works with Medicare and Commercial Durable Medical Equipment claims, followed up on aging reports ,take incoming calls from patients,disburse refunds to patients, send monthly statement, and verified insurance, post insurance and patient payments"
good,"Everyday was different for me, sometimes i would close and others I would open. Each day basically consist on the samething, inventory, typing, providing grat customer service, and working as a team."
good,"I was a college extern, went to work and assisted in different departments, I learned mutiple things daily. the coworkers are super friendly. there was no real hard part to the job. The most enjoyable part of day learning something new."
good,"I did my hands on training for Pharmacy Technician. I learned how to count the pills, generate labels, read prescriptions, restock the medicine shelves, and how to have complete control when handling upset customers. (Not that there were very many of them!)"
good,"I enjoy working with this company it keeps you interested. You get the experience of multiple personalities of people along with learning the medical terminology. I had the option of speaking with different roles of the medical field such as prescribers, legal affairs, and government assisatance."
good,"Mentor co-workers, work directly with management, manage a strong book of business, manage/lead projects"
good,Working one on one with customers to get them what they need. Its always easier when you make the customers happy.
good,"This job intrigued my investigative nature, whenever the need arose to debate the need for a medication to be dispensed. Here, I learned the basics of medical billing and coding. My duties varied in regards to administrative tasks, such as filing authorizations, contacting care facility staff, or verifying insured demographics. The bulk of my responsibilities was to resubmit a queue of rejected claims directly to insurance companies via third party billing software."
good,"Great for anyone interested in a field that pertains to chemistry or biology. Most of the day is customer service. Although you have understanding customers there are always those who try to get under your skin. To this company, the customer is always right just like that of any other big name companies. Work is easy once you understand the day to day operations. The only downside is that they work on a percentage table where everything is recorded such as how much time it takes to pick up a phone call, address the customer by name, surplus inventory. This is overwhelming for most because some things are not attainable."
good,"CVS is a top company. Very successful business model which sets the model for the chain pharmacy/healthcare sector. However, the in store and lower mid level management staffing levels are dangerously low as service suffers and employees are not properly heard above the store level."
good,"I loved cvs for the fact the customers I grew to like we’ve built a great relationship. Some were really nice and loving. I had two managers that, really loved me and worked with me threw anything a"
good,"Lots of customer service, handling customers and maintaining store appearance. "
good,"Typical call center, monitored environment, plenty of assistance and room to advance. Emphasis is on attendance and quality.   Flexible schedule availability. Great training program, with plenty of one on one time."
good,"CVS is your basic retail job. It was a great job for me while I worked towards my Bachelors Degree. The hours were fairly flexible, but can quickly turn into longer hours depending on holidays/location."
good,"A good company to work for, for sure they do have great benefits and if you do want to advance there is chance of advancement if you follow up with the manager."
good,"If you're looking for a long term job with room to grow, this is a good company to invest time in. This job is very hands on even for store managers so be prepared to roll up your sleeves and get dirty. Store managers are a jack of all trades when it comes to running the store."
good,Clean work environment. Fair pay. There are opportunities for advancement for the right employees. Three shipping errors in a year gets you fired regardless of how long you've been there.
good,"Very good company to work for,  however, it can be challenging for new practitioners  because the job requirements can be overwhelming. Patients are appreciative. Stable environment and pleasant and helpful colleagues."
good,They do not pay enough for the amount of work that is expected of you and there is no support from colleague to colleague if you have not worked for several years previously.
good,The people at CVS genuinely care about their work and each other.  CVS is a good  company to work for but it unfortunately has limited room for a colleague to grow laterally in certain Networks.
good,"I learned a lot working as a Pharmacy Tech at CVS. The team was supportive and we got our work done efficiently. Everyday was not perfect but with a suportive team, it made it worth it in the end."
good,"Management was very flexible with their schedules to accommodate for my college courses. It was a well managed pharmacy, that tackled every challenge head on. There are a few testy customers, but the team always managed to resolve the issue."
good,"i am excited to go to work as a way of giving back to the community, and living a purpuseful life. "
good,"Easy going and alot of knowledge to learn. Opportunities to help new employees get trained once hired , fast pace environment. Inbound calls assisting members with their benefits plans"
good,"Good company.  Many ways to move forward in the company. Learning is encouraged.  Training is ongoing.  Management is at times,  hard to connect with and give ideas to."
good,Co-workers always helped each other out. Friendly place. Store was always clean and organized. Every week items were checked for outdated products. Even ringing people up we always checked to make sure we weren't selling customers outdated items.
good,"CVS was a sure thing during the recent recession. Strong customer service skills are a must. The high deductible health insurance is a problem - be sure to use the savings account they provide (which lowers your base pay but whatever). Not all stores are the same - some are run much more poorly than others - so your mileage may vary. Overall though, CVS is a good job and you can make some real friends there."
good,"CVS?Pharmacy is a great place to work.! As one of my first pharmacy jobs, everything i know to this day is from what i learned there. This company offers good benefits and new opportunities to employees and will even pay for your first license exam.!"
good,"CVS is a great company! However, there is no work-life balance. The hours and stress of a retail pharmacist outweigh the benefits of working for this wonderful company."
good,Working at the CVS store as a front store retail worker. I been blessed with decent managers and good coworkers. It's a decent job to build some experience but nothing too crazy.
good,Culture revolves around providing good customer service merged with corporate culture of managing payroll and budgets. Lots of opportunity to work. Always hours available for pharmacists.
good,"You will always be busy.  Job offers many learning opportunity"
good,I was only a store manager in training for 3 months as a training opportunity while transfering out of the military. The team I was assigned to work with was fantastic and always will to help. There is a lot of office work to be done while it is also very important to make rounds around the store. Needless to say it is a very fast pace job.
good,"Its very quiet,calm and easy working there you will learn geat customer service the hardest part of the job is stocking while being a cashier managment was okay."
good,"Good place to work only if you are in management"
good,"Typically I work 3-6 hours per week as I have another full time position.  I make myself available to fill in when someone is out sick of on vacation.  "
good,"Hours vary depending when manager assigns the time."
good,I enjoy working there. There some thing to learn that I don't know of. Helping the customers what they needs. There away something to do for restock the items.
good,Very busy work environment. More tech help would be a plus. Management expects results with daily and weekly reporting. Front store staff and pharmacy technicians generally as helpful as possible given time and staffing restraints
good,"I loved most of the people I worked with, as we mostly all got along great. After working with them for so long though, you get tired of all the little things. Regular customers become people you look forward to seeing, but you also get tired of the abuse from customers when things don't go their way, but hey, that's retail for you. The people in corporate are nice enough, but they want you to hit all these metrics or if you don't then you're a bad store. Your customer service can be awesome, but if you aren't hitting these other things, you're going to get yelled at. If you want to advance anywhere above a shift supervisor, good luck. You may be part or almost part of the next level, but you'll be there for a while so don't trust the 'rough' estimate time frame they give."
good,"I worked for two different stores with a total of 3 managers, and had problems with 2 of them who either focused more on their store rather than trying to work with me and my schooling or let other people run the store and take advantage of it"
good,"There was constantly something that needed to be tended to and that allowed for a good workflow. "
good,Work stations are very spacious and support groups are always readily available. Breakfast and Lunch are available in the cafeteria.  Jeans and polo type shirts were the everyday dress code.  Very pleasant atmosphere.
good,Good place to work and have to have good attendance. Good management and Supervisors. Very stressful at first but once you learn and get used to everything it's a good place to work.
good,Great place to work! The pay isn't that great and benefits aren't the best but you do have numerous opportunities to grow personally and within the company if you'd like. If you are in management they do cross train you for the pharmacy.
good,I enjoy having a great working relationship with all the staff. Each day has its new challenges that I look forward to overcome. Having the answers for others is very rewarding for me.
good,The staff I was surrounded with were so amazing to me since day one. I never felt like a newbie and they make you feel so welcomed. Glad to know that I made good friends with some girls there.
good,"In a typical work day, there is pick up ( where the customer comes to pick up prescription orders), drop off (where customer comes to take written prescription, order medication already in the system, and insurance claims), production (where prescription orders are filled), and drive thru (at select stores; mix of pick up and drop-off). With CVS, the customer comes first. So if, a patient walks up, you always acknowledge/greet them, finish up what you are doing, and take care of the customer. While working at CVS, I've learned how to effectively communicate with a patient and great customer service skills. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the patients. For the most part, our patients are very understanding but can be very demanding. Working in the medical field, you have to keep in the back of your mind that most of your patients generally don't feel well. With that in mind, you learn patience and you learn to leave your personal feelings at home. This is also the hardest part of my job as well. But for the past 2 years, I've gotten a pretty good grasp on it and learned to just listen and do what I can to help the patients."
good,"fun and a relaxed place to work with no dress code, its also a place for getting into shape, walk about 10 miles aday, paid lunch and break, in season get overtime."
good,I find working at CVS is rewarding but unfortunately a company restructuring has made advancement near impossible. Only a candidate with a pharmacists schooling and equivelent degree can advance to District Manager.
good,"I worked at CVS for 2 and a half years and really enjoyed it. Management changes frequently but I liked all of my managers. Pay is a little bit better than similar jobs at other companies. Benefits offered to full and part time employees. Vacation time increases each year for full time employees. Annual performance reviews and raises. Management is very supportive, They will back you when it counts. Fairly flexible on scheduling but you do have to work at least one weekend day every week which is standard for retail. Many regular customers made work fun. Never a dull moment. I only left because I was ready to leave retail."
good,"Cvs was a very fast environment, if you do what you are told and exceed expectations you will get promoted. Cvs pays fairly and above min wage in TX. As an assistant manager I learned enough to go straight into the store manager role for another company. Great place to work for all positions the benefits are good"
good,"Nice company to work for, as most retail companies: more work demand than hours given to perform tasks at hand. Management required to work 9 hour days and frequently more than that. Pharmacy is King, most of support goes to them."
good,There area lot of tasks on top of serving customers. Fast paced environment. Downsides are work life balance. Enjoyed people but heavy lifting involved.
good,Working for CVS is fast-paced in that your first priority is assisting customers but there is always a project and/or daily work assignments to be completed. Must have excellent people skills; not just like people but be friendly in a way that matches whomever you may be assisting at a time. Build instant rapport.
good,Take care of employees.especialy holiday pay.medical great.etics line available for employee benefit.room to advance in company.plus customize your retirement.
good,"At the store I worked at, the management was great! The regular customers were always friendly."
good,"The environment is fast paced,non stop. It can get boring, you have to have the right mindset.  If you want to advance, you have to kick down doors or you can get overlooked."
good,"Enjoyable atmosphere.  I enjoy working here.  The company has strategic goals to improve healthcare and lower costs, which is a great mission to get behind"
good,"CVS pushed me and gave me the opportunity to show what I was capable of doing. I enjoyed working there it was like small family. but it was hard to reprimand a worker cause it was of the family environment, but I had to do my job. I learned that life is like a box of chocolates you really don't know what u will get with store managers  cause I went threw 6 to 7 store managers"
good,"I worked for Omnicare, a CVS Health Company which is LTC not retail. It paid more and had better benefits and perks than retail. There are also more departments and opportunities. I really enjoyed the job and would've stayed but I got fed up with a bully who just wouldn't quit."
good,"The job is very active, and fast pace. They do have daily goals and incentives if you reach your goals. Which I was a high performer. Reaching goals and at times I was a trainer in both areas I worked."
good,CVS constantly cuts it's pharmacy hours sometimes unable to get more then 34 the 36 hours. This becomes an issue when you're relying on 40 hours a week overtime is non-existent.
good,learning a lot in the health care field with insurance and customers service. As a tech i collaborate with the pharmacist to fulfill the needs our our customers.
good,The hardest part of working at CVS was learning the billing information and how to submit claims properly to insurance companies through the CVS system. It took a long time for me to truly understand the system and I am still learning as I go.
good,"Great place to begin a career, however they do overwork you and under pay you as a Tech. Training is hard to come by as management is expected to teach you and they often don’t. Great place to start working, but not to stay"
good,Love what I do!!! Just a lot of work and little help!!! Not enough pay for the amount of work and they should offer overtime!!! They have great benefits for their employees!!!
good,"Whenever you're there, you don't always feel so stressed out and like you can't get nothing done. I always work with a group of people I can get along with and it's a very easy job for the most part."
good,The management could use some work but I enjoyed my time at CVS. I learned how to interact with customers and how to operate a cash register. I also learned how to stock shelves and keep track of inventory. Also was helpful to answer phones as that gave me some experience.
good,"A good place to gain experience with customers and cash handling if you apply. Also, you will never have a set schedule, and you’ll most likely have to work afternoon/evening shifts, since daytime shifts are mostly reserved for Management, which sucks. You get paid minimum wage until you become a supervisor, and if you do become one here, it will be very stressful. But overall, it’s not too bad if you’re a cashier and the people I worked with was super chill and sweet including management."
good,Pharmacy technicians learn a lot from working there for the first time. Great learning experience for all looking to enhance their pharmacy technician skills.
good,"Great company with good benefits. Very fast paced and requires good physical condition of you are managing a store. Always plenty of work to be done "
good,"It was great work for CORAM / CVS I got to learn to prepare TPNs, Hydration bags, IV syringes, IVs for home infusion and inventory control and management."
good,"Overall I would say that working at CVS is relatively easy going. My main concern is it being so easy going that going against the grain is seen as going overboard. For instance making it to where all shift supervisors work a weekend and night or actually having a weekend day off without having to request it."
good,"Looking for a career in retail. CVS is a wonderful place to start. Easy to advance, easy to work with scheduling. Crazy customers. Must put in the hard work to get the benefits back."
good,"It is one of the busy, fun, productive workplace to in retail. The customers are very friendly and the coupons are easy to fix if they are wrong, no one ever gets mad. If you fall behind in a lot of work it can get a little stressful but as long as you manage your time and continue putting effort into your work, you'll have a good time.."
good,The management needs improving. The company overall is a great place to work. They provide ways to advance within in the company. Such as training from a cashier to a pharmacy tech or from a cashier to Shift Supervisor. The pay starts out good as well.
good,"1. Day to Day Operations: Daily tasks such as monitoring my teams attendance, reviewing and pulling team statistics. This also includes hiring and managing performance of new hires as well as the current team. Other examples include compiling monthly, semi-annual, and yearly performance reviews for employees to discuss performance and manage to those performance outliers. Providing consistent feedback through delivery of positive feedback using the rewards and recognition programs as well as addressing performance concerns via corrective action."
good,The January overtime killed this job for me! It is mandatory to work 20 overtime hours a week during the 1st 2 months of the year. I loved my paychecks but never had time for anything but work.
good,A wonderful work environment that challenges one's work ethic. Cvs Health provides an employee with an opportunity to change peoples lives for the better.
good,"I was part of a lay-off within CVS, I will miss working with my team and working with a great manager with integrity, people skills and knowledgeable."
good,Working at CVS is fairly easy where the only difficult part is dealing with customers who are generally terrible but the job in itself is very easy give or take some.
good,Friendly work environment fast pace very helpful great learning experience room to grow a lot of training to keep up to date with whats new and things you need to know to grow with the company
good,"Not a terrible place to work. the pay is good and the people are decent. i had the benefit of having a great team of people to work with while some other teams are slightly mismanaged, but are still able to pull through with the help of other teams"
good,"Under my first store manager, I was offered a multitude of time to develop, to better myself in both home life and work. I was given the tools to succeed."
good,"Working with customers was fairly easy but,"
good,"CVS is a great company to work for. "
good,"The work days were consistent, the pay use to be fairly good but the contract changed shortly after boarding on, depending on the department, the hours varied."
good,Pharmacy is very fast paced always moving and helping customers. keep you busy at all times. I have learned about insurance as well as how to communicate better with customers. hardest part of the job is dealing with unruly customers but once you befriend them they will eventually open up and make your day better knowing you help them beyond measures.
good,"I worked in waterfall methodology for CVS pay module and Shop module, Involved in combination of native and angular mobile application. Involved in the ratings and reviews project."
good,"CVS is a great place to work especially if someone is looking to get some experience in the medical field. Working as a Pharmacy Tech, helped me get experience in the medical field that I could apply to other places in the future. My favorite part of the job was filling prescriptions. I enjoyed counting and labeling the medications as well as getting them off the shelves. The hardest part was learning how to handle insurances and what it meant if the insurance wouldn't cover it. Overall CVS is  a great place to work to get started in the medical field."
good,Loved the team I worked and our customers. Very rewarding to assist  customers with such an important part of their healthcare and to help them navigate through our complicated insurance system.
good,"If you are new in your career development, then look for some good start ups. Here growth will be less in terms on learning. You will learn much better in a start up."
good,"I really enjoyed what I did at CVS Caremark. Benefits are actually pretty good. The coworkers are great. Management can be a bit better, some are good, others are not. Turned into a lot of favoritism towards certain coworkers that were part of a pack with supervisor. If you can avoid all that drama, then you will certainly enjoy the job. Pay can be a bit better for the work but still is decent for starting out.  I think it is around $11 now to start. Every job is easy. Wish I had stayed but I was one that thought grass would be greener on the other side......not always."
good,"Fast Paced with poor work life balance.The management was very hands on with each department.  success in this company is possible, however it may take some luck."
good,"Working for CVS was not bad at, I learned lots of things working for this company and the people I worked with were all good people. The hardest part of working for CVS is, working in the warehouse."
good,"i loved my store and my bosses at the store, they were understanding of live and, me being a single mom, i needed that. however, the company is flawed. they live by the ""there's 10 people behind you that would love this job"" the ""higher ups"" don't care about you."
good,CVS is not a bad place to work.  I am looking to advance my career.  There is little to no room for advancement.  CVS managers and my supervisor are not bad to work for.
good,"Apoio de toda a equipa e colegas de trabalho durante o trabalho."
good,"I enjoy working at CVS because of the multi-tasking, calendar entries, expense reports and all of the daily tasks that keep me busy through out the day."
good,There is nothing hard about the job. You work at your own pace. Management is okay. You learn a lot about chronic diseases. Typically it's a okay job.
good,Data Analyst Contract over Jan 28th. Have Skills you need in both analyst and hospital vocabulary and experience. My work ethic and attendance is above average even having to drive 68 miles one way to work in Scottsdale for CVS from Casa Grande. see references.
good,I gained more knowledge about billing and how to deal with insurance claims. I also gained more knowledge on how the pharmacy works and collaborates with other hospitals.
good,My transfer employers waited me out of their sister until I no longer had a job. they did not provide me with hours and instead of talking to me they waited until CVS sent me a letter in the mail.
good,"When i worked there I enjoyed it but i was working two jobs already so that was my reason for leaving.  Interacting with customers was great, the people i worked with were nice, and the job was pretty easy to pick up on."
good,Everyday we had to set up for the day and make sure that we followed the schedule so that later in the day everything would be smooth and we could dispense everyones medication properly. Patient care was a definitely the number 1 priority.
good,Fast paced job that requires you to develop multitasking skills as you will constantly be challenged against time.  Leadership skills are required as you lead your team to achieve company focus results.
good,"It is a very good job. Not too keen on the management skills. I learned how to work independent and to take full responsibility. The hardest part of the job was working together with general managers, they were never on board with your agenda."
good,I have gained serious customer service experience while working at CVS. I have learned how to see where the customer is coming from with their anger about prescriptions.
good,"CVS is a good place to work, there are a lot of benefits. You get to interact with the customers and build a relationship with them. Its nice to feel like you are really making a difference in someones life."
good,"CVS is a good place to start as a new pharmacy technician because of their structured training systems and daily workflow. Also because of being a big chain, there is room to float between stores and have ability for a flexible schedule."
good,Hours are very flexible. Most of the managers I had worked around my schedule with no problem. The hardest and enjoyable part of this job is the customers.
good,"I work at busiest store, so you will never have easy day. Its always busy. I have learned to work under pressure. I leaned about medicines like generic/ brand name, what is it for, control substance."
good,I loved working here. It's very laid back and a fun environment to work in. I made some good friends there. At the time the manager was nice but she no longer works there so I'm not sure who the manager is now.
good,"A typical day at work at CVS/Pharmacy was very relaxed but also busy. I would have to handle the customers as well as handle other tasks such as stocking shelves, keeping the work space safe and clean, manage orders over the phone, and also set up seasonal decorations or items. I learned that it is much more easy to start your tasks earlier and efficiently rather than starting much later and with bad quality. Using your time wisely can help improve your shift tremendously. It was a very safe and friendly environment with enthusiastic workers ready and willing to do their jobs. The hardest part of the job for me was handling the money orders, prepaid cards, and other transactions that would require me handling cash and credit. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers happy and having a successful sale."
good,"I enjoyed meeting and getting to know my co workers"
good,"With CVS Health, you get what you are given.  Sometimes your supervisor is supportive and helpful, others are not.  Some of them are knowledgable and others are not.  Just make sure you know what you are doing and you will be just ifne.  The attendance is strict so make sure you are ready to be there."
good,"Hardest part of the job is trying to make patients healthy and happy at the same time. Sometimes what is in their best interest health-wise is not what they want to hear. Insurance billing has become more and more challenging each year. "
good,Being with CVS has taught me to always push myself to be better than I was the day before. They are always about improvement. The company is always looking for ways on how to improve the system to make our lives easier on a daily level.
good,A great outlook for CVSH and is future within health industry. Current acquisition of Aetna will help to change the healthcare landscape in the next couple of years for positive.
good,"CVS Health is a great place to work"
good,I have no complaints about working at CVS it just didn't work with my school schedule enough for me to stay on as an employee. The job was very simple and the hours were well spent
good,"I would recommend working for CVS. Turn over is often just due to colleagues not wanting to work. If you want a busy work day, this is the place to be!"
good,"CVS has a very good and intense training program, both classroom and computer modules are used. Call volume on dayshift is intense, be prepared to answer a LOT of calls!  It is a satisfying job, in that you are helping people and Customer Service, Customer Satisfaction is important to the company. The management team is knowledgable willing to share their knowledge, and unlike some companies that I have worked for - they CAN do your job, and still do take calls as needed. From that perspective, if you need help, they can and will help you. The people that I ahve worked with are friendly, willing to assist if they can . The hardest part of the job is telling people that their co-pay is going to be astronomical, and not being able to really help. Mostly you are able to offer avenues and get them help and that is very rewarding."
good,"You print out the prescriptions in bulk, fill them, let the pharmacist check them and it goes to the back to be scanned and put into appropriate bags."
good,"I work in a team of trained pharmacy technicians, lead by 3 pharmacists. They're the leaders of the operation on a daily basis, but techs have relative freedom when helping customers."
good,The hardest part of the job is working is retail. The hours vary significantly. Those who have seniority get the most amount of hours. Some of the managers are ok to work for.
good,The job to life ratio was very difficult. Every time you think you have time off they are calling you to come in or to work at another store. there was nearly no personal life due to this on going issue. I did learn a lot about the work system and stress the pharmacists go through daily. the hardest part of the job has to be almost never having time off. The best part was helping the costumers and seeing how relived they were when I could make sure all their insurance issues were taken care of.
good,"Standard 9-5 mentality, but with flexible hours. A great environment when working with the right team. Rare opportunity for advancement unless you're working to become a pharmacist."
good,I had an amazing manager at the facility I worked at - he empowered me as a supervisor to ensure the company received the needed technical support to continue its mission.  I left the company when that manager was forced to go to another facility to get it up and running.  The new management did not have that same level of commitment - and as a result I left
good,CVS Health provided me the opportunity to practice Prior Authorization in Managed Care environment. Formulary management was the biggest aspect of this pharmacy practice.
good,A typical day at work consists of shocking shelves and mopping floors. The managers were really cool and laid back. The workplace culture is friendly and welcoming. The hardest part of the job is stocking candy bars and them keep falling down. The most enjoyable part of the day was working with my Co-workers.
good,Usually really busy so you can't spend too much time with any one customer which can seem counter-intuitive as a healthcare provider. But the people that you do have the time to really help makes it feel worth it.
good,very fast paced call center. Monthly performance coachings made it easier to understand what was expected of you. SOME of the managers were better than others.
good,CVS Health is a great office setting environment to work in. There is plenty of diversity within the company. The work days are spent mostly at a desk on the computer but also include a series of presentations and meetings.
good,"its a very productive place to work it is always something to do, you have a lot of opportunity to learn new things, helps you with customer service skills and computer skills"
good,"In all, CVS is not a horrible job but not something that is meant for me. Hours are also getting cut and I personally cannot live off of 20 hours per week."
good,I worked in the pharmacy for 10 years. They require a lot without giving a lot. Short staffed and management is always on staff about things that they have no control over.
good,"I have been working for CVS for 5 years now, they have treated me well. However, the wages need an improvement. starting slightly above minimum wage for Pharmacy Tech position is not enough due to the heavy work load each technician is responsible to handle. the work can become stressful dealing with different patients who are under various mood changes and can take a toll on employee. CVS Pharmacy is a place where patients come to purchase their medication, but they also have to deal with MD clinics, offices, hospitals, health insurances, co pays which they most of the time blame the Pharmacy for the incompetents."
good,"Very detail-oriented work that keeps you busy all day. If you're salaried, you can expect to put in some OT, but you'll be compensated pretty fairly. Non-salaried employees will be expected to refrain from any OT."
good,I enjoyed working at CVS as a Pharmacy Technician. It could be stressful at times but the staff are very helpful and gives support and the team would work together to create an efficient working environment.
good,Nice place to work if you enjoy helping people. Easy going environment allows you too work at your own pace. Some workers are friendly others are so so like any other job. The best thing about this CVS is that the level of stress  doesn’t get very high unless it’s Christmas time.
good,Very fast paced with incoming phone calls for prescription fills and  checking on ship dates and questions regarding medications. Almost always calls were in queues.
good,"Work is demanding but it takes time to get acquainted. Help from technician varies. Not everyone is properly trained. CVS tries to train technicians but it’s not structured or rigorous enough in my opinion.  "
good,"well I did pretty well so far, I do excellent as I do as my previous job to be honest. Alot of duties and things to work on but it'll be great the more experience I get."
good,working here had some good days and some bad days. Sometime customers would be rude and would have any patience which can be stressful.The pay can be beter
good,7 years in the company is pretty unreal especially starting off in my teens. I’ve gained a lot of connections with customers and colleagues. I’ve got to experience each department and was able to grow within myself.
good,"Pretty good environment with opportunities to move around within the company. Offers an onsite gym, weekly fun things that we celebrate, like popcorn Fridays, hat day, pajama day and more."
good,"love, love, love the people and the environment. the only thing I wish was better is the pay. the pharmacy and the store managers are great. I  would recommend this place to anyone to work at!"
good,CVS is a good company to work for. I have been there over five years. I have been a transporter the entire time I have been an employee there. But honestly I wish CVS Health paid more to their employees.
good,"Took too long to achieve next career step. Made promises to advance with out follow through. However, pharmacy management was knowledgeable and equipped with appropriate tools to communicate with their staff as to what was expected of them."
good,Nice environment and place to work. The management is fair and friendly. I learned a great deal about the photo service and money services that id offered to the guests. the most enjoyable part of this job was helping the guests with their purchases.
good,"CVS is busy busy busy, CVS provides jobs for individuals with in house promotions to a certain extent. Pay could be a little higher for employees because its gets busy to the point that it is very tiresome manage"
good,"This is an extremely fast paced job that is not for the easily stressed out or slow learners. Even the slower days are busy in most locations. On the plus side, the days will fly by quicker than you realize. Depending on your store manager you may get a free lunch on the occasional weekly shipment. On the downside, you are heavily monitored on the results of customer surveys and metrics and are very pressured to do well even if you don't have much control (i.e. lots of cranky old people with bad insurance plans unhappy to have to pay outrageous amounts for their medication when you have no control over it)."
good,"Data entry, customer service, insurance specialist, production management, inventory specialist. It can be a stressful work environment, but the thing I enjoy the most is helping people. Depending what store I work at. If I go to another store the people at other store are rude, and act like they really do not want to bothered other than to do production so the day goes by sooner. I have sat and observed other stores and It does not matter if it is CVS or Walgreens, the staff act the same."
good,"CVS is a great starting point for Pharmacy Technicians.  They offer you the certification test at no cost to you, including study materials.  The pay is decent at best.  There is a lot of gossiping and management doesn't do much when confronted with concerns.  If you don't know something, you will probably get a ""Why don't you know that?""  Other than that, I got along with everyone and they trained me at a slow pace.  Probably could have been faster, as it took almost the whole time I was there to reach the last step of training, but would be good for someone that's not catching on very quickly."
good,"1. work days go quickly (my store was right across from an ER)"
good,"This company is a nice place to lay the foundation for your career and yourself as a person. This is the chance to really get yourself in order so you can figure out where you want to go next. This place with provide you all the tools that you need to exceed in your life whether that is inside the company or outside. All jobs are going to have their moments of frustration and that is always expected, but at some point maybe when are increasingly frustrated maybe that is a sign of change that's either you advancing in the company or taking your talents elsewhere. Whoever reads please consider this as an option to further advance yourself, it's a great place to start or in some cases restart your journey and what better place to start then CVS."
good,It’s about who you know and not what you know. The leadership team make all decisions on who should be doing what and they base that on who they like.
good,"•	Work under pharmacist to drive quality patient care and excellent customer service."
good,"A good place to work.  You must be able to advocate for yourself to obtain the training you need and to be allowed to work at all the pharmacy stations."
good,"Been with CVS for 8+ years. Love my job, love the challenges, love my colleagues - but outside hires are paid exceptionally more than than folks who have been with CVS for several years. Only way to make a fair wage is to leave and then come back as an external hire... But then you lose your longevity."
good,CVS is a fast paced job. I found it to be a fulfilling job.  It is also about team work.  The pay rate is very fair and you can receive compensation if you pick above rate.
good,"Not the worst place to work, but I make wages from a different state, but this isn't worth minimum wage. Everyone crams everything into a week and expects it to get done with just a week to do it with 5 people."
good,Good place to work and great colleagues. Good stability. Good long term clients and projects. Great opportunities. PAce depends on which group you belong to; business or information technology.
good,"Advancement and pay is low, pay increases are really minimal. Management is helpful and supportive when giving tasks. Overall this is a great place to work."
good,Good company fast paced environment are able to work overtime for many positions as well as holiday pay. Also ability to advance in company to tech and benefit verification positions from the call center.
good,Good company to work for depending on your role and department.   Company is expanding and a lot of restructuring taking place to accommodate the changes ahead.
good,I enjoyed my time spent at m.  I worked 30 years with them and it was hard to leave a company that I had worked with so long.  They trained me in the pharmacy program and I enjoyed the management very much.
good,"The experience taught me that my real talent is in customer service  and I know I would be a major asset in a role like this one, which focuses on improving the customer experience."
good,In this fast paced work environment every day is a learning opportunity. Working in healthcare has taught me many of the skills I have today. I truly enjoy my field of work and I love being able to help others.
good,"Busy Chain store pharmacy, plenty of help, good computer system, plenty of support from non pharmacy personnel, non pharmacists became district manager which became problematic"
good,If you can stand for 8 hours a day and multitask fairly well then this would be a great place to work. Weekends can be stressful due to lack of staff available.
good,Collaborative but competitive work environment.  Provides industry standard benefits and opportunities.  Making strides in improving customer experiences.
good,"My position requires multitasking, communication, leadership and constant diligence throughout the day.  I have learned to continually train my team and engage them in workflow so that they may understand all measured metrics."
good,Job security is definite as long as you strictly adhere to your schedule. They take attendance and QA very seriously at this company. Attention to detail is a MUST!
good,"Independent walk in setting with emphasis on autonomy. Schedule and ability to pick up extra shift were dependent on local work mates. "
good,"CVS Distribution Center is close to where I live. It's fast paced and is a large work environment. You can keep to yourself for the most part, but a large part of the work is a team effort."
good,"A typical day consist of greeting customers, packing out merchandise cleaning the store ,cleaning the stock room and unloading incoming merchandise.   ..."
good,the pharmacy I worked at was very busy.  A lot of the time it felt understaffed and a lot of pressure from the district managers were placed on emplys
good,"Pay could be better for the lower level employees, but still a great place to get experience. I worked with pharmacist everyday, making sure patitents get there medication."
good,"CVS Pharmacy is a subsidiary of the American retail and health care company CVS Health, headquartered in Woonsocket, Rhode Island.[1] It was also known as, and originally named the Consumer Value Store and was founded in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1963.[2] The chain was owned by its original holding company Melville Corporation since its inception until its current parent company CVS Health was spun off into its own company in 1996.

good,"Responsibilities were clear and thought out. Training was very good."
good,"In the Incident Management role at CVS, you are responsible for managing the restoration of service to all critical systems. You learn the key players in each application/service space, and who to call. You also learn how to summarize action items and restoration steps, as well as business impact statements that will be provided to leadership from both the IT and Business sides of the company."
good,"I've been with CVS for 2 years and it's been unpleasant, because my previous manager was under paying me the duration of my time there. I've received increase in compensation."
good,the previous pharmacy manager was ridiculous. now theres a new pharmacy manager and would love to come back. I worked at the store in warren ohio and it was really a great store to work at! it truly needed new pharmacy managers and now that it has one its a great store as a customer
good,CVS is a busy pharmacy had you gotta be ready for the good bad and ugly. Lots of sick customers and they wanted their medicine like yesterday. it was part time job for extra $$$
good,Fast paced and can become very stressful at times.  My employment is prn/part time and I enjoy working there.  Have gained so much knowledge in all different areas of the pharmacy.
good,"My typical day at work consists of filling prescriptions, helping patients check out their prescription orders. I process the scripts that we receive from the doctors as well as those that we receive electronically. I also assist customers that need help finding over the counter items and any other needs. I also call patients to remind them of upcoming refills and to follow up with any inconsistent records on their profile."
good,What I have learned at CVS is that you have to be able to multi-task in a fast pace pharmacy such as the one that I worked at. The customers can be demanding.
good,"the environment is quick paced and sometimes stressful. The patients are the best part of the job and sometimes the worst depending on the situation. Once you catch on, it's pretty easy."
good,Worked well with other employees that I managed. Lots of customer service and marketing done on the phone as well as visits to other 
good,Workload is massive and management doesn't care about life balance. I work 12 plus hours and because I am salaried; there isn't extra compensation for it.
good,CVS Distribution is a good place to start a career in the distribution field. You can learn quite a bit about different programs used in the distribution process. You can also learn how to operate powered equipment.
good,"It takes a lot to get anything done and lots of politics involved in many decisions. Certain groups are better than others, really depends on the work and the management group. Many are frustrated by too many inflexible processes and lead times to launch digital products."
good,"I started off working at CVS Health (then it was CVS Caremark) as a data entry clerk in the mail in pharmacy. I worked there for a total of five years, even coming back after leaving for a  better paying job. Once I returned, I promoted up to a Team Lead. Throughout all of my roles, I learned a lot about health insurance, medicare/medicaid, developed customer service skills and public speaking skills. When I became a Team Lead, I would train new employees and retrain employees that were struggling on  a number of computer programs and processes throughout the department. "
good,we were robbed for the 1st and 2nd time in less than a month apart and they still didn't get us a security guard. also the pay was very low for how much is expected of you.
good,"Daily you see polite and very nice customers, some very rude ones."
good,A typical day at work was a lot of police around me at the time and transfer over to the cvs by my school its quiet and I have a better learning choice
good,Constantly changing. Payroll is extremely tight in stores and as a District manager you are asking managers to work long hours impacting their family lifr.
good,"stressful at times, bad time-management,some friendly coworkers,making the customers happy,short staff,every day i learned something new.we have a lot of snow birds."
good,"1. typical day i imagine that i will always come in time, early morning. I will check the schedule to see if the tasks from yesterday were done."
good,"Have awesome experience with most pharmacist. they are willing to teach you. If you have good team spirit, then working with others will not be a prolem"
good,I enjoyed working at Omnicare/CVS Health. I was very sad to have to leave my position. My position became obsolete and I was laid off. I believe I was treated as fairly as possible.
good,Show appreciation to your techs. Place them where they are best at not based off where they want to be in the production line. Listen to the advice given.
good,The community I work in was an upbeat inspiring one.  The customers are very friendly.  The position was relaxed and the manager was exceptional.  I would definitely recommend his store and would return if need be.  The company overall is good.
good,You will have a lot of bosses to report to due to the corporate structure of a major corporation.  Many managers are easy to get along with yet others can be difficult.  Overall a wonderful company to work for if you can deal with corporate politics
good,"If your like to challenge yourself & learn new skills, working as a Pharmacy Technician is for you."
good,My current position at CVS Health is with a wonderful collaborative team and a brilliant decisive vice president.  Developing new business for the company was interesting and exciting work.
good,open store at 4am unload truck and stock merchandise on shelves set up for opening open store at 9am and  bank deposit and setting up draws to start the work day.
good,"Great management, bad training, good people high turnover, fast paced fair treatment overall good place to work, the call volume may be a problem for some but it makes the day move fast."
good,It is a good place to start. You can really develop skills that will be useful not only here but you can apply to other jobs. This place has provided me the opportunity to move up and to develop.
good,My typical day at work is quite organized. The system is very friendly and has the needed tools for fast learning. Modules easily give me the other needed heads up.
good,this job gave me an introduction to pharmacy. worked with re filling specialty medication phone orders. you have to  be ready to take calls from start o shift to end. talking to coworkers wasnt much of an option. you are being tracked all your shift and must be on the phone. most thing i enjoyed the most was PTO given. you dont have much time to meet your peers.
good,ita a good place to work but you will work ...cvs never closes so the balance is tilted to the work side.. money was good 18 to start and the benefits a good 401k match
good,"I love my front store manager. He is always there and supportive. However, my Pharmacy manager is more unfeeling and cold.. Even if you are sick or have a sick child you are expected to come in. If you don't know something then you get reprimanded for it. And most of the times you were not shown how to do that part of the job."
good,My job was simple at CVS. I used to love working / exercising at the same time. Also I only had 2 duties on the job unload and stock. Also the employees pick the other's slack if one was too slow on a shift
good,You tend to get lost in the shuffle of 600 plus employees in one building. Wonderful location and work breaks and lunch are good. They have flex time with the availibility of working 4 10 hour days.Relocated to another state was the only reason for leaving.
good,"CVS is a good place to work, but they are short staffed most of the time. There is only one pharmacist and one technician working at a time and it can be very very busy. Customers can by nice, but many are just fed up with the short staffing situation,"
good,"I always enjoy the fast-paced environment but not when they don't let you finish what you are doing and at the end of the day you kind of feel like a puppet that they move at their will. I love my spanish speaking customers and they love me because I understand their needs and give them the time to explain in detail and then I refer them to the appropriate person to help them."
good,"A typical day at CVS Pharmacy was hectic. As the Inventory Specialist, I managed the other technicians as well as have to keep great count of all medication that was in stock. Management helped as much as they could when days were extremely busy. I learned how to read prescriptions, type them in, fill them, and file them away. I also learned how to work with health insurance companies to better assist our patients."
good,"epathetic with customers, knows customers and co-workers at a personable way.  great work ethic, always on time. great customer service. always first on board to try new initatives."
good,"Workplace ambiance is peaceful, you get to manage your time, patients and you own workflow. You get to work in advance and finish off 2 to 3 days worth of work then focus on other important parts. Friendly staff."
good,"I learned about there ordering system,how they added in and restocked medication. I felt safe and secure.manager did not want work around my 1st job, which was only 2 days a week and the first of the month which was only 4 hours a day. i loved my job at CVS it is a great company. There was nothing i disliked about CVS. they worked as a family."
good,I had a difficult time 'working' with some people.  You are not doing your job if your on Facebook on one scree and Sports on the other monitor. Boss was good easy going.  I was RIF.  My position was no more.
good,I currently enjoy my position at cvs health but would prefer to work in the other states I am licensed in (CA&HI)due varied working conditions(like labor rules) and climate.
good,"This is a wonderful place to work! The work is fast paced and dynamic, good fun challenging work for a business professional with a wonderful work culture."
good,this was my first professional job after working at a fast food restaurant. gained a lot of experience thru this. Also learned how to handle with angry customers in a professional way.
good,"Communication as a representative the department of specialty prescriptions."
good,CVS is a good place to work.  They provide ample opportunities to grow professionally.  There were a number of great people I met throughout my time at CVS.
good,"It is a great place to work. Only down side is there are budget cuts which means lack of hours. As a person trying to survive,  not getting guaranteed hours is s huge down side."
good,"I started working for CVS/Health as a contractor at their website support call center. After my contract period was up, I was urged by leadership to apply to a permanent position on second shift. I was hired as soon as I applied, and got a decent raise from my contractor rate. "
good,Overall it is not a bad place to work. The location that I  was employed in had a Cafeteria which also had a very healthy selection on the menu. People are generally nice.
good,"Collaborate with the Pharmacist to fill customers written or electronically sent prescriptions and verify with the pharmacist that the information is correct."
good,i liked the job and the people at cvs. My manger was a nice person. My schedule was very flexible. it was nice work with other people. I had leave the job because i moved  to Washington state.
good,"I was able to learn various  aspects of working in a pharmacy including compounding oral and topical solutions, prepacking medications, and performing returns and credits of medications."
good,"Working at my location is a plus except when management start cutting technician hours in the wrong time that include flu shots , snow birds and sick time of the year. Managers and DM cares about budget and numbers more than caring about how much impact did you have on patients. Hardest part is not having enough tech help and standing all the time with minimal food and bathroom break and the most enjoyable part is making connection with patients that you feel you are home talking to your patients."
good,Working at CVS as a pharmacy technician has proven to be a challenging but rewarding position. The management team has been supportive in helping me grow within the company.  During my time at CVS I've been able to develop great customer service skills and obtained a vast knowledge about pharmaceuticals.
good,"I enjoyed my work here and I enjoyed the people I worked with. It was a quick paces and high volume pharmacy, but we always made it enjoyable. I would have worked there longer if the pay was better and the hours were more available."
good,"I, regretfully, only worked at CVS for a short period of time several years ago, so my memory of the place is a little foggy. I do remember that I loved going to work every day. I also remember that the rewards program was awesome."
good,I started at CVS through high school.  I trained to be a Pharmacy Technician.  I enjoyed the customers. After several years they became like family.  Loved working with my pharmacy manager at the time I worked there.  I left and moved after almost 13 years with the company.
good,"Cvs health is a pretty good company to work for. Though some changes could be made. For the most part, a very enjoyable job. Does offer some room for advancement."
good,loved CVS. and will go back if needed.  presents everyday challenges that can be satisfying when completed. can be boring at times.  developes your professional skills. wish break times were longer. wish training taught you everything you needed to know. most of the skills you'll learn is on the job.
good,"I actually loved my job working with the public.  Customers can be difficult but it was a challenge trying to make every transaction and every customer happy.  The work was easy and my job consisted of tidying up and and keeping my area clean, the place stocked and assisting customers on the floor so there was always something to do.  Management was helpful although during my time there I had 4 different managers and that was an adjustment but my job remained the same.  The turnover for cashiers was somewhat consistent but overall I enjoyed the people I worked with very much we were a ""team"" and that helped with the morale of my work environment.  I think the hardest part of the job was working with new management because the turnover was so frequent on managers."
good,"Long hours, travel, excellent pay. Not great for work / life balance, but great for job security and advancement if your do well in metric measurements"
good,"Great pharmacy, all the staff is great and friendly. Always helpful they make sure they go out of their way to make customers happy. Take care of any issues."
good,"I appreciate the fact that my regional supervisor has done everything he has to make me feel comfortable along side with all of the pharmacists I've worked for. It is a demanding job, but overall, I still enjoyed work. I've learned a whole lot from all of the pharmacists I've worked with, and they have all been very kind to me and my situations. I couldn't ask for a more understanding team at each location I've worked out, or every pharmacist I've had as a mentor."
good,But if you're educated or experience look somewhere else. The pay is low and there is at least 1 day a week in which there is no work to be done. People are great and the team building activities help out
good,"With a strong manager, CVS teaches good work ethic, the importance of time management, and rewards those who put the time and effort into their tasks."
good,"I give it my all every other day  loading, unloading, sorting and moving products and materials manually and using material handling equipment and carts. I learned to reach my goal to put 1000 boxes in slots everyday as I'm multitasking and working overflow off of pallets."
good,"CVS is has a fast pace retail company with long hours and very little flexibility in schedule.  The pay and benefits are excellent, however the workload appears a little unrealistic at times."
good,Management in pharmacy changing constantly without notice. Too many slackers and chit chat. They do give you all the hours you can work as so many do not want to show up.
good,"This is an amazing company with big opportunities, you can go far and advance at your own pace. The big con is the politics and how its at others discretion when the advancements start."
good,"Protocol for work changes every month or so; New responsibilities are added. If you want to stay busy and have a challenging, yet somehow mind numbing job, look no further."
good,"Cvs is a great company to work for, the shift flies by and the people you work with are great. The only downside is it can be very stressful at times."
good,"Enjoyed learning everything involved with being in a pharmacy"
good,"I have been with the company for 16 years and i have seen it all . "
good,I love working here I have great employer that are caring and understanding. I have built great relationship with the patient and would consider them friends.
good,"I really enjoyed going to work everyday, managers and coworkers made the working environment pleasant. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that the customers received the best customer service possible."
good,"If it weren't for the insurance, I'm not so sure I'd stay. The workers are nice, the management is OK, but there's a lot of improvement that could be had."
good,good people to work with. got the proper training that you needed to be able to do the job. management was always helpful if you needed help with something.
good,High pay with great 401k-plan.  Management flexible with schedule but overly serious to the point that daily workflow and basic tasks is a struggle.  Mediocre Health Insurance benefits. Company really nice and caring but overstressed about minor issues.  Hardest part is extra stuff that distracts from primary pharmacist responsibility.  The most enjoyable part of job for me is standard pharmacy tasks.
good,"The job is organized for the most part, you know what you have to do when you arrive. You know what is needed to be done for the day unless a late order comes through. As long as you do the work before it needs to go out to the patient you should be fine. Some days are longer than others you just need to know how to schedule your things to do to make sure you get everything done on time."
good,There is a lot to learn here if you want to learn about the pharmacy industry in the long term perspective. You should be a fast learner because you will be expected to pick up on things quick.
good,"I loved working with the customers, enjoyed getting to know all of the regulars. The people that I worked with were awesome. I was not a fan of the district manager or the store manager - just because they only had their own interests in mind.  However, the cashiers, pharmacists, and supervisors always had fun together and were easy to work with."
good,"good job to get experience, easy to move up to supervisor positions within a year. as a supervisor you count down registers and supervise the floor, as well as accept all the incoming orders."
good,"CVS Shared Service Center  is a great, and for the most part a great career choice. There is a lot of change  with management,  but change is sometimes good."
good,"As with any chain pharmacy, there are challenges in meeting specific company metrics. At times, there is not enough staffing to be able to finish all tasks and reach those metrics. The environment can be intense at times but CVS does provide tools and aids that can help over come certain obstacles. Since I am currently at a lower volume pharmacy, I am able to meet customer's expectations and needs a little better. Sometimes, the customer's expectations can be unreasonable but as long as I can reset those expectations, things become smoother.  This in turn can make the environment less intense and less stressful."
good,"I worked at CVS years ago. When I worked there it was a great work life. I advanced from cashier, to photo tech, to pharmacy tech. Great advancement, just had a hard manager to work for."
good,It was a fast paced place to work.  Became more familiar with compounding.  Management was great.  Fun Place to work.  The hours.  Meeting and make new life long friends.
good,"Great company to work for if you're looking for advancement opportunities. Only negative thing to say really is the fact that just this year, most recognized holidays we now have to work. Excluding, Thanks giving, Christmas and New Years. My direct supervisor is wonderful. The management urges and assists you to exceed."
good,"a lot of the work can feel a little monotonous after a while, like stocking the shelves, but getting to know the customers and really seeing how you can help others  in having better healthier lives can feel really rewarding."
good,"We changed managers several times where I was there had to adjust to what they liked .it is a fast pace environment  we would stock shelves,on load day organize shelves hang tags pull down old ones do plan o grams. We were constantly checking dates too"
good,I currently work there under a temporary position but the people that have been hired for five plus years complain all the time how they make the same amount people that get hired in make. No bonuses at this job for staying with this company.
good,"I worked there out of high school into college and I loved everything about the company and management. I was promoted with in four months of being hired and remained a supervisor until we parted ways. Hours were good for a student and flexible. Store manager was great with teaching the inner workings of the day to day management of the entire store. Loved this job, it was my first job!!!"
good,"the management is nice, they actually care about you as a person. the benefits are terrible. the work itself isn't bad, pretty easy as long as things don't get behind.job can be a little boring."
good,Everyday is a new day that you have to give the customer a greetings to make there day brighten up. Its always busy that you can  forget your break time. Management is very helpful specially for trainings. The hardest part of the job was when someone called in and no one can replace that person. I enjoyed so much when I make our customers satisfied to all our good service where giving them. to me that's my accomplishment everyday I worked at CVS
good,"The company has values, and aims to follow them. There is always somebody you can talk to if there is an issue, doesn't matter if it's a manager, supervisor or a team member... You can learn a lot about everything, concerning your health. A typical day at work is busy, but in most cases rewarding."
good,the day can change at any moment due to new starts or different things that arise during the day.   enjoy working with a variety of people .  must be able to handle several things at once and work ahead.
good,I love my job and the people that I've work with. I have a sense of purpose and pride of doing my job. But things change for the worst. New management need improvement on how managing employee.
good,"On a typical day, pharmacy techs collaborate with pharmacists to ensure customers receive quality care and meet all health and safety standards and protocols. Specific job duties include sorting pills, creating labels, reviewing medication side effects, greeting customers, and ringing up purchases. Some CVS locations also contain drive-thru windows, which pharmacy technicians often operate."
good,"I am a Randstad contractor who works remotely so I am unfamiliar with the workplace culture, job security, or benefit structure.  The ability to work remotely has been invaluable to my work/life balance."
good,"Definitely is a learning experience, you learn new tools and new information everyday, always a training that can provide further knowledge about the company and ways to improve your job skills"
good,"The work environment is very well managed. Depending on the store and manager, the work environment can change completely. CVS has taught me how to professional, courteous, and enjoy having conversations with patients about their medications or any problems that they might have."
good,"I was a part-time pharmacy technician at CVS/Pharmacy for a few years. It was my first tech job and I really enjoyed it my first year, but soon after I realized it just wasn't my thing. The plan was to get through it while I'm in school, I just couldn't any longer. It's a job you either love, hate, or learn to resent. The pharmacists are fine to work with, if you know what you're doing. It's a very high-paced job so on-the-job training is the only way to learn, i.e. trial and error. It's frustrating and sometimes you'll feel helpless in the beginning, but don't give up and just be patient. I have acquired a lot of meaningful skills in my time as a Pharm Tech including the ability to multi-task, molding into an employee that can handle stressful situations, patience with impossible customers, genuinely working as a team with your co-workers each shift, etc."
good,CVS Pharmacy is patient centered so employees tend to care for the customers first. I have learned many skills required for being a pharmacy technician. The management have helped me in many areas of difficulties. The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy with the service provided.
good,Pharmacy is busy. but I enjoy my job. The hardest part is explaining the benefits people receive from their insurance. I feel overall the job is very fulling and I like to help people live heathier
good,"The job is great if you are able to multi-task and share your focus amongst many, many aspects of the job. You're in constant contact with your customers and are responsible for the maintenance of their overall health. There is a lot to learn from top to bottom. It can be stressful and hectic at times, especially if you work at a busy store and you don't necessarily get to learn what you need at the pace that you're used to."
good,"Job was good for a single person with no kids, that lived in the city.  The commute wasnt bad, some of the people were a bit much, but wasnt a terrible place"
good,"The job really isnt bad at all. I am able to study while at work and still manage to get my work done (when working in the front store). As for the pharmacy, it is a completely different story. If you do not like basically being confined to small spaces, working in a pharmacy is/will not be for you."
good,good place to work just need to be more focus in trying to advance to the next level something to llok forward in the company... benefits are good but a little expensive if you dont make enough money or hours
good,"A typical day included 50+ Calls per day in an office environment. Your Coworkers are friendly, willing to work as team, and managers are there to assist at a moment's notice. During my position there, I was challenged and pushed beyond my believable expectations of myself. In it I discovered many talents in myself and made incredible friends along the way. The benefits are great, the experience is phenomenal, and the people there are have created a culture for you to succeed in."
good,"Working together to keep the whole store in shape was well worth it. Although there was no security in the store, there were times were i did not feel safe myself. But I didnt mind going into work."
good,"Easy job, decent people, good pay. Be on time. This place hasn't been open long and recently fired half of the employees that started there because of too many points. They have had the points for months but because there was a high call volume they kept people. When the call volume died down they fired them. Don't give them a reason, show up or quit because they will fire you."
good,"Cvs is a fair place to work, but it depends on the store your working for.  My store, was flexible with hours and management was easy to talk to.  But, CVS has a lot of rules to follow."
good,Ample training is offered. Not a lot of room for job growth. Patients are the #1 priority but sometimes corporate seems to forget that they are a\our most valuable assets. That we must keep our customers happy
good,"I changed jobs because I thought I was going to be making more money due to all of the overtime they were getting but then I started, I got sent home early and my checks are only around $730 every 2 weeks bring home. I'm a single mom and I need more money so I'm looking for another job."
good,"- Work is mostly remote"
good,Loved my job!! Advanced to where I wanted to be. Fun crew to work with. Moved twice with company. Seen facilities come and go. Was my all time favorite job
good,"The time that I spent for CVS was amazing. My pharmacists were great people who were a true pleasure to work with, and I have nothing bad to say about them. The company on the other hand, was no so amazing. There was never any kind of positive reinforcement of policies. There was no real way to advance in the company. I worked there for three years and never made over $10/hour even though I was told I did exceptional work."
good,"Its nice working to CVS, working is fun and exciting. There is a lot of scope to develop individually and also as a team player. I would love to go back to CVS Health anytime given a chance."
good,This is a good place to work but not if your just starting off in the pharmacy world.  It's a very fast pace job that requires you to already know a lot of things.
good,"Once trained you work pretty independently, I learned anything I asked to get trained on.  Management was new, however they were very understanding in all matters. I loved my co-workers but the pay wasn't great."
good,"CVS is a good place to work, and depending on your manager you can get good hours and work with a good crew. However unless you spend your time at school getting a four year degree or have worked at CVS for two years, you won't advance far."
good,I really enjoyed working with my patients on a daily basis most of them actually called at least once a week. It is a very great place to work with constantly changing workloads along with positions available. You can work your way up.
good,"Decent company to work for. Nothing special, enjoyable for the most part. Must be good at customer interaction/service to succeed. No real room for advancement besides shift supervisor which is triple the work for not enough pay in my opinion."
good,"Originally worked for Coram Healthcare and merged with Apria. CVS took over a couple of years ago, and everything was doing good until they decided to close the billing center in Rancho Cordova as they opened a new facility in AZ!  Now, majority of the people impacted from the lay-off are still unemployed!"
good,I met a lot of different type of people. My job was always something to do. I was treated very nice with a lot of opportunities that was offered to me
good,"As in any retail business you are always making sure the store is ready for customers and patients. Customer service is the key to success, fast friendly and making a daily difference for the return customers."
good,CVS Cares!! I do as well. This statement made me work harder everyday to show how much we all should care. Achieved goals were always recognized by CVS.
good,Good place to work I would recommend to anyone starting out in pharmacy to get into Cvs for the learning experience.  Because of my training there it lead me to even more amazing opportunities.
good,"It's nice to work in this company coz they have good benifits, long hrs sometimes which is good for extra money... I relocate here in Ok is the reason I gave up that job... that job helps me to on time, alert and be responsible whatever the management told us to so..."
good,"CVS is a great company to work for. There is a great deal of opportunity for advancement. If anyone is looking to really advance in their career CVS is the place to do so. The people are nice and friendly in each department I worked in. The downside is management is not so great, need more experienced managers in some departments. Also the benefits are terrible, you pay a very high premium and the plans are high deductible plans."
good,Working in the pharmacy environment was wonderful! I was able to learn so much. I was able to learn new skills and get the chance to experiment with something different. It was definitely a teamwork type of company and I loved that.
good,Working with the your co-workers is great. They have great management. Schedule very flexible to your needs. The location of the store is good for bus users.
good,"I learned how to deal with customers effectively but quickly. I would go in and help make the board to where each person would spend their day. From register, production, drop off, or drive thru, we all shared this task and had to work together to get them all done. The workplace was nice but we did not have much time to joke around because there was always a task at hand. Most enjoyable part of this job was drop off, where I handle prescriptions, answered phones, and talk to patients about what was needed."
good,"Working at CVS has helped my communication skills tremendously! I am able to fluently hold conversations with customers and help them buy the necessities they need. At first it was very hard. I was a shy person and afraid to greet customers because I thought they would not greet me back. However, overtime I became comfortable and people actually began to greet me back. Its not what you say, its how you say it. Greet people with enthusiasm! I also learned how to do planograms which at first was very difficult, but eventually I ended up being the best one to do it. I was able to pick up my pace and I would complete the task in a few hours , the most a day ."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers. We are fast paced and enjoy working with great people. I gave learned at lot from my co-workers. We work very well as a team.
good,CVS Health is an ok company to work for. The pay isn't great but its a great company to have on your resume. Advancement is possible but with such a big company it can be difficult to be noticed.
good,"It was a pretty tough job. Being a new technician was a tall order, but   the learning curve was the best part of the job. I learned customer support skills and communication skills the most on the job."
good,I've worked for the company for 14years. I started as a cashier and later was promoted to Market Investigator.  It took several years before this promotion occurred.  I am along with another person are the original people who began the program and are still working in the company.
good,The salaries are not good. At all. But the environment is positive and easy to get used to and the work is challenging. I don't really know what else to say. It's an okay place to work. I wouldn't recommend it to a person who's trying to live off the salary.
good,This was a very good job after just graduating school. I was equipped with the tools I needed and confident in my role as an ARNP. The clinical managers were awesome and always there to guide you if needed.
good,"The people I work for make my job the best. The management is awesome as well. The hardest part of my job is trying to agree with the way CVS does things. I've learned so much, how to talk to people in so many different circumstances. I've learned how to work with people, more so then before. It has been a great experience but it's not for me anymore. I am currently going to school to become a teacher so to find something more along those lines would be amazing."
good,The workplace culture is very supportive of individual professional growth and places a high value on collaboration.  There is a genuine concern for employees at the corporate level and high expectations for performance.
good,"Busy, customer service, multiple tasks, basic knowledge, store management is nice, top/head management is strict. Hours are not stable. One week I have 30 hours, the next week I have 40"
good,Working here was really nice place to work.  Communication was not always there.  The people were great to work with.   Some management was nice others not so nice.
good,My typical day was very busy. Management was ok but was rarely available in my department.The manager was not willing to work with peoples schedules when it was promised
good,"The pharmacy I work at is low-volume, meaning we fill a low amount of prescriptions each day. Because of this, the pharmacy only staffs 1 technician and 1 pharmacist per day. On busier days, the work is almost overwhelming. On slow days, I'm left wondering what to do with myself. "
good,CVS/Minute Clinic offered an excellent work environment for anyone that prefers to work alone.  The training was adequate.  Management was present and accountable.  Some work rules were vague and negatively impacted one's work/life balance.
good,"managing the front end and helping in the pharmacy at times."
good,"J'ai été entouré de bonne personne, ma tutrice était quelqu'un d'agréable elle nous aider beaucoup quand on avait des difficultés. Je me suis bien plu dans ce travaille."
good,very busy and fast paced environment. learned a lot about medications and insurance. I learned how to be patient with frustrated customers
good,"Fast paced work environment requiring multitasking, can be stressful with customer requests ans insurance contingencies"
good,"Equipe de trabalho muito boa, empresa com valores bem definidos, grande oportunidade de aprendizado, porém escala de trabalho ruim, não possui muitos benefícios como vale-refeição."
good,CVS is a Great company to work for. It's just to be such a big company the pay really sucks to deal with some of the people you have to deal with on a day to day basis.
good,I worked at the corporate office and it was a great place to work at. The people there were friendly and easy to work with. My co-workers were the best. It was a lay back environment with easy work.
good,"enjoyed every moment of my work. Earned a lot of retail experiences, multi tasking and taking care of customers and keep up the corporate culture. great experience"
good,"The days are always busy. The work is always coming. Makes the work day go by faster. However, understaffed, which allows for error and unsatisfied wait times. With the fast-paced environment, to be understaffed just makes the job less enjoyable. Schedules for 8 hours with chance of having to stay an extra hour or so with only one 30 minute break. On top of that, the break room is in the hallway of the public restroom so customers come in and start asking questions. "
good,"A typical day as a pharmacy technician can be a bit hectic, but with a great team of coworkers, I have enjoyed my time working here."
good,"A good place to work, with great benefits and several positions available for growth within the company. Must be flexible for scheduling and be able to work in a fast efficient way."
good,"Always have tasks that need to get done. Learned how to manage my time better, enhance my critical thinking skills, and enter correct data appropriately."
good,Overall they are a good company to work for. They could pay the technicians a little more but the benefits are pretty good. You get a good amount of vacation depending on years of service. The management overall is supportive.
good,"work hard, make more money....cvs will only take you as far as you are willing to work hard. If you dont plan on working hard then this will be a dead end job but work hard and learn all you can and you will go far"
good,CVS is a good company to work for. My supervisors understood I worked a second job that paid more and allowed extra time for my studies. I just think the Policies that the CEO is making is not improving the company in any way. I believe my boss and supervisors are the best and more understanding.
good,It is a good Company to work for the only down fall is that they never have enough cashiers to do everything. the benefits were very good  it was a good job
good,"Great place to work for a new grad.  Clinic protocols are all laid out, so very easy to follow what treatment plan is necessary for a patient.  Great support from health educators and immediate supervisor.  Scheduling is awesome ... lots of flexibility.  It's a bummer though because they are open weekends and holidays (although only specific clinics).  Benefits suck.  I think there's a high turnover because of that.  Pay is pretty good for the San Diego area."
good,I enjoyed working for CVS for 10 years. I was encouraged to continue my education and was compensated by CVS for eligible classes at University.
good,"I'm giving Management 5 stars because of the amazing Pharmacists I worked with.  I learned a lot from both of them.  A typical day at work would be assisting regular patients with their medication needs.  My most enjoyable part of the job is seeing our ""regular"" patients.  They were the reason why I come in to work. Hardest part would be when hours are cut, but I am able to manage along side the Pharmacist.  I learned everything Pharmacy related in this store"
good,"Nice costumers,co workers are nice too, store manager are good except one that racist ,busy store, the hardest part of the job ,when somebody call in sick and its very busy."
good,"Highly productive environment .I work with time sensitive issues. Alot of contact with healthcare providers and nurses. I handle daily reports ,electronic funds transfer request as well as electronic remittance details. I triage high dollar Hempholia claims working with nurse case managers, upper management etc. Responsible for handling provider issues and addressing claims which were processed incorrectly. Lead for researching misdirected payments by working with finance to assure that correct providers receive their funds. Handle CMS audits gathering all requested details and addressing potential questions or additional details that may arise during the audit.I assure that all pharmacy details are up to date and correct based on a daily feed."
good,We have a great work place and awesome team members. The manager isn't the sweetest person to employees (maybe just me) but great with customers. The work is fairly easy and working with the customers and patients are always great!
good,Providence Hospital is a good place to work. There is always a lot of changes going on so job security was a problem. They always did big cuts so I was very nervous if I would have a job or not. Overall my employees are awesome. Great place to gain experience
good,The management needs work. I believe in people who have worked at a place longer then others to be able to get do do certain needs as in getting off early everyday but not taking complete advantage of it.
good,"I started with this company immediately after school and it was not easy especially since i was new to the medical field, but 5yrs later i have learned and grown so much i would recommend Coram to any of my friends in the medical industry. the company is continuously growing, the staff is diversified, the work is challenging, management is okay, but the rewards are endless from room for growth, traveling opportunities, learning, sharpening your skills, 401k, and yearly pay raise."
good,"The location I am working in is always busy and never a dull moment.  "
good,Busy store with customer service. Making sure that shelves are stocked and employees are busy. Cash handling for supervisors and making sure customers leave happy. Every now and then helping out with the phamacy and the customer service.
good,"CVS is a good place to work. Especially when you're just starting to work. Management is pretty cool and the customers are too. As a cashier you have many duties. Helping customers, scanning in new inventory, sending items back to the warehouse, handling confidential papers and products etc. The hardest part of the job is that there sometimes isn't a lot to do on certain shifts at the store. Over all, it's still a good job."
good,"Come in clock on and start counting out registers and doing morning paperwork and bank drops."
good,Family owned business so the care of their employees was important. It was a factory job but not stressful. Funny people to work for and with.
good,good place to start a career and to get advancement in a collaborative practice setting with different department of hospital where you work as a team for the overall benefits of the patients.
good,Working for CVS allowed me to work full time and go to College. They have opportunities if you wish to advance in business administration career.
good,CVS is a top ranked pharmacy.  We were challenged daily to give caring customer service in a high volume pharmacy.  We had an outstanding team with techs from different backgrounds that we encouraged to use their strengths to help bring each other to a higher level.
good,A workplace where relationships are encouraged in order to get though a daily shipment. Customer service was also a big hit. Coworkers were talkative and friendly to everyone that came in and any trouble anyone had (including workers) help from workers and management with ease thanks to their experience.
good,"A typical day included data entry and filling prescriptions.  There were always different issues to handle daily as they came up.  I enjoyed helping customers either with their insurance or doctor issues, and being able to save them money on their prescriptions."
good,"At FFC I attained many leadership skills which has helped me in my roles as manager and team leader. All 12 years at Fulham were brilliant! The people and the role was brilliant, but i left to persue my career in caring."
good,"It is a calm environment, the place I work at is very coupon-friendly. So therefore, its main goal for the store is to reach a sales goal that will help benefit from the store. Also it also helps customers to better health through different options."
good,"At the time I was working for them I had no kids and had another job as a direct care worker. It was a wonderful job. It taught me a lot about the pharmacy world. I left the job when I got pregnant and because I felt that my other job would benefit me more at the time, If I got paid more I would love to go back."
good,"Overall, its not bad however there are days where the job can become extremely stressful and overwhelming. It is extremely fast paced and you must learn quickly. Management could be better, in terms of organization and communication."
good,"my customers, co-workers,and manager its a great place to work. I walked in knowing nothing. Now I can teach some people some things thanks to my awesome team"
good,In my experience working at CVS Health a typical work day is working with people to get their basic needs met. I learned how to approach customers who may need help and may not full have the patience to wait around by helping them as fast and efficient as possible. My management and co worker team also does an exceptional job because we all work together to get results.
good,"Typically a fast-paced and dynamic work environment. Co-workers really become like an extended family. We try to make the best of the work day by joking with each other, but still being professional."
good,"A typical day at CVS in the coding department would consist of checking my e-mails for new or existing clients that need updated benefits to provide their employees.  I have learned a great deal in regards to Microsoft Office and Excel spreadsheets.  The management staff were wonderful and very helpful with information on how to handle certain clients.  My co-workers were also very helpful with the learning process for coding in general.  The hardest part of the job was getting the programs to work for some clients that have had existing plans with us that needed drastic changes.  One thing I enjoyed most was the work environment, very positive."
good,"Company is customer focused and staff supportive, they encourage investing in home, health, family, education and future funds. I learned much in future fund investing, health responsibility and how critical effective communication is. A typical requires you to learn quickly and retain it even though you may not use it again for some time. Taking care of a patients medication and helping them understand the treatment is the most enjoyable part of the job, it can also be the hardest. Management provides development tools and training and colleagues are expected to motivate and help each others growth which there is little time for."
good,CVS was a very enlightening experience. My management gave me my first opportunity to engage in expanding my field of study. They were very positive and encouraging. I love my patients and miss them terribly. I learned about insurance billing and how to give my patients the best opportunities to afford their medications. The hardest part of the job was learning when a patient or spouse was no longer with us. My heart was always with their families.
good,"Our pharmacy team was  fabulous.  Working as a home town pharmacy in a small town, allowed us to truly connect with our customers and ensure their ability to get their medication in a timely manner."
good,"The benefits at CVS are AWESOME! If that is a deciding factor for you whilst looking for a job/career they are definitely worth mentioning. The training is decent and there was support from out of state by ""vet"" reps that give tips and tools that allow you to really learn the job fast. If you are the person that can do the same thing over and over without much versatility (without being bored) then this would be the job for you! The hardest part of the job is not going above and beyond and sticking to the numbers/stats that the policy would like you to follow because people that you deal with seem to be somewhat blindsided by the fact their insurance uses cvs mail order service for their prescriptions and it's hard to be cut and dry to really sick people who do not have clue as to what is going on!"
good,"I love the company's vision- ""helping people on their better path to health."" The most enjoyable part is helping people get healthy and easing stressful situations relating to patients' healthcare needs."
good,"Daily functions are resonable and well managed."
good,"A typical day was Busy, and  Challenging"
good,This was a good company to work for however hard to advance. I loved working with customers in advancing the lives to better health. There was some hard times due to policy I could not assist like I would like but that's apart of the job.
good,The company as a whole is a great company to work for. Most of the time they will work around anything that comes up in your life.
good,Busy clinics. Learned more about vaccinations for all ages. Flu season was difficult due to giving flu shots. Managment was always helpful for anything question or situation.
good,"My First day at office"
good,"I still work for Omnicare in the Salt Lake Pharmacy which also hold the billing office upstairs.  I work in the billing department which is a great job.  The managers know what they are doing and are always willing to acomadate you if you need to leave for an emergency, time off for an appointment or just want to take a little bit longer lunch to have it with your child.  We have potlucks at the pharmacy, and try to make it a very enjoyable experience for everyone. It can be very stressful at times though when the bills get to the facilities or patients and everyone calls in at once to complain.  And of course lots of people like call in on Fridays which is very frustrating."
good,Time always flies because there is always a million things to do. Taking care of customers is important but sometimes the hours were limited - so that there weren't enough employees on staff to get the job done as expected.
good,"really nice, fin place to work.  Learned how to input insurance data.  fellow team members very helpful.  management was not very helpful in pharmacy, relied mostly on fellow teammates to teach me new things.  most njoyable part of job was the ability to assist customers"
good,"Arrive at clients home prepare clothes , and bath ,prepare all meals administer medication make client comfortable."
good,Outbound calls insurance carriers to follow up on status of payment. Incoming calls from insurance carriers and patients. Billing of claims to insurance carriers. Mailing letters to patients for balanced owed.
good,"I am able to help customers of various ages, backgrounds, and ailments on their path to better health and happiness. With my knowledge of customer service, pharmaceuticals, and insurance billing, I can bring exceptional advice and recommendations to customers and co-workers alike."
good,Daily routine was left to my discretion since I remained disciplined enough to complete my projects. Management was flexible.  My staff were some of the best people employed by this company.  The hardest part of my particular job was getting my managers to understand exactly what I did since my area was outside of the normal characteristics of the company.  The ability to remain autonomous was the most enjoyable element of my job.
good,"CVS is a good company to work.A typical day at work consists of testing application/software, fixing issues that may have came forth through the testing phase with the development team."
good,great place to works  as a team and to develop  people interpersonal communication skills  with several opportunities especially individuals  planning to pursue careers in healthcare
good,"ambiente muy tranquilo, momentos para descansar y horarios agradables que permitían estudiar y hacer diligencias."
good,Very productive workplace and the people were easy to get along with. they were very helpful. The pharmacist and all employees were able to help around the pharmacy and were all about teamwork and focused on the customers.
good,"I'm not sure what to say, It was a nice place to work. Friendly customers and a good crew of employees. If not for moving to a different location, I would most likely still be working there."
good,"A typical day at CVS was answering many incoming phone calls daily, but this was the job, you learn new task on a daily basic because issue an plan changes, management was there to assist in any new issues, or cowokers that have been trained to assist you as well, the hardest part of the job is, I don't remember any hard once training was over, and your job became permanent. l enjoyed this jobbecause it was fun to work, the atmosphere, the opportunityto workovertime."
good,"Overall it was a great place to work."
good,I used to work at the financial center is Rancho Cordova. This is a great company to work for when you're just finishing medical billing program. You gain a lot of experience and can take the experience you gain to another company. Definitely room for advancement for employees. I've seen so many people promoted within months because of hard work and dedication. The pay is ok and the benefits are too expensive. Management is professional and not a stressful environment.
good,"The owners are fantastic people. It was a joy to work for them. Took over managing the office so the owners could focus more time on ministry efforts. They wear many hats and run a few diverse businesses, so it was never boring. There was sometimes stress dealing with customers when the owners were out of the country - I felt I had responsibility without the authority to really fix the problem."
good,"Days at work were very easy, management was excellent. the coworkers were very friendly. The work was very easy and enjoyable."
good,As a manager at CVSHEALTH learned more about employees and customers. Everyday is new challenge because you need be patient and cautious so that you don't hurt some customer's feelings. My goal at CVS is to help people to better health.
good,"This company has an extremely great work-life balance and you gain a lot of experience working in a fast-paced environment. Promotions (in the Pharmacy) are limited and are hard to come by. The hardest part of the job is the stress level, but with time and proper training you learn how to handle stressful situations. You get the chance to work with a wide variety of people and the chance to pick up more shifts at different stores. Overall, the job is pretty decent."
good,"Evening shift as a Manager was a little bit more difficult than days shift. Learning to have a lot more patience with out of line customer, dealing with Pharmacy questions was sometimes difficult. Management is top notch, always there for employees, Corporate was always there for helpful advise. Coworkers are fun to be around and always there for a laugh. Hardest parts of the job is dealing with theft. The most enjoyable part of the job was fulfilling all the customers needs and them leaving with a smile."
good,Supportive and flexible employer with many avenues for growth.  Leader in the PBM industry with innovative solutions to health care challenges.  Will learn a lot about the PBM business and prescription benefits.  Will work with many different internal departments as well as outside vendors giving you great knowledge and background into these different areas/ businesses.
good,CVS is one of the top ten Fortune 500 companies.  They consistently promoted from within and offered educational assistance.  Training was made available to me internally as well as externally.  I really enjoyed working with my coworkers.
good,Everyday is different.  It can be a busy work day with some challenging customers and some days can go through easily and quickly.  I welcome everything I learn from my supervisors and managers.  I try to work fast and efficiently as I can. I like the contacts I have with customers I take care of.
good,"I enjoyed working at CVS, I had hoped to gain full time status but in the 3 years I worked there they never had an opening for full time. The crew was awesome and we received bonuses every year for Christmas."
good,Fast pace job with a great crew!  New store grew fast in 6 months. Expectations keep getting harder from management.  Enjoy working with the public but I am ready to explore more options and avenues in this field.
good,Ive learned a lot of skills involving medical billing. The location in which I work has a very friendly and respectful atmosphere. Everyone works as team and does their mandated tasks efficiently.
good,overall it  was nice job very routine a lot of medication I love speaking to knew people on the phone and knowing I was apart of helping them in there health was a great feeling
good,"CVS was a good company to work for; however, the hours and pay were low but the advancement to manager is easy to attain. Nothing else to state."
good,"CVS was a good start up job, to afford me experience with customers relations, and sales.  Management was very pleasant, as well as other employee's."
good,"Overall, CVS is a good company to work for. The managers I worked with work just as hard as they expect their employees to. They are also very friendly and they take the time to get to know everybody on a personal level and are super understanding of any personal situations that may come up. The workload never ends, so if you aren't willing to work hard during your shift from beginning to end then this company is not right for you. It is literally, hit the ground running. Compensation could be better especially for those who bust their butt in the pharmacy and raises should be given more frequently and indefinitely over a gradual time period for those who exceed the expectations. The main suggestion I would have for this company would be to be more flexible with the hours allowed to sustain great customer service to our customers during our busier times and especially when hiring a new team member to come on board so that they get the proper training deserved."
good,I have so far enjoyed working at CVS Pharmacy but I'm afraid it is not where I see myself 5 years from now. The Workplace and overall workflow is excellent management and colleagues are fun to work with. Just wish I got paid a little more.
good,"Not a bad place to work and the benefits are pretty good.  However, the employee satisfaction and job turnover rate may be a little better if the pay rate was better than it is."
good,"A well run company, good to it's employees and very professional but yet personable. Benefits were good and working environment was pleasant"
good,"Always learn something  new ,great work enviroment , and safe. New and creative goals.Everyone works as a team. You get a chance to expand your knowledge.Have a choice to work at other locations."
good,"Rewarding place to work for, and a great place for experience with a supporting staff! CVS is a growing and thriving business and requires excellent customer service."
good,CVS is a great company to work for. The hours are definitely offered and very flexible. The only thing I believe they could change is the pay for the pharmacy workers.
good,"Very busy office, lots of new things every day. Lots of new challenges but a lot of the same problems every day. Only thing I did not like was the long hours every day and working weekends."
good,"It was a nice work place, I liked the fact that they did not just stick you to one job. You had the opportunity to do things all around the store. I was not just stuck being a cashier. I would do add every week, warehouse, Photo Dept and put up displays. There was always something to do! The customers are the main focus for everyone who works there which I also really liked."
good,"Customer Service"
good,A typical day was always long no matter how many hours you worked because of how busy it was on a daily bases. The employees were very kind and also very close. I was known by a lot of customers who came in there on a daily and was always addressed by my first name. I very much enjoyed working there but i just wasn't getting enough hours which means i wasn't getting paid enough to take care of my needs and responsibilities.
good,CVS has treated me well and granted me opportunity to settle into a new place to live. I've polished my people skills and can take a large amount of various experience with me wherever I go. I'm prepared to lead myself to bigger and better things.
good,Always challenged to learn new things. Lots of opportunity for advancement. Need to be ready and willing to step up and put in the hours during crunch time.
good,"CVS keeps the pharmacy staff lean and expects top notch customer service with accurate prescription fulfillment. "
good,"Employees get plenty of breaks throughout the day so you don't feel ""chained"" to your desk. Calls come in very quickly, must be able to deal with multi-line use and some computer knowledge. Management is a bit strict, but that's to be expected when dealing with a customer's health. OT required during welcome season."
good,Offers a steady pace environment with opportunities to learn new skills. Advancement is limited due to low staffing. Company would be recommended to someone who is looking for a first job or a job while in school.
good,"I currently work there now, been there  14 years, forklift operator, did many different jobs in the warehouse, I just wanted to go out and do something I love instead of being in a warehouse 8-10 hours a day."
good,Hectic and Stressful 8 to 12 Hour Days Processing 200 to 500+ Prescriptions. Co-workers Were Hard Working and a Pleasure to Work With.
good,"The people at this company are great to work with and very friendly."
good,"It was a very busy place work, but I learned a lot from the pharmacist by asking him what certain prescriptions were and what they were used for.  I would always try to get patients prescriptions cheaper if I had seen that they were really high and they stated that they couldn't afford them."
good,"I liked the work I did while working at in this field: management, building relationships; working closely with people to motivate and assist in team building.  Billing, learning, teaching."
good,"Due to exponential growth during the time I was with CVS Health/Pharmacy the culture and advancement opportunities changed quarterly.  Management & workers were shifted too frequently at times."
good,"They can provide training to you as a Pharmacy Tech and Cashier."
good,"* A typical day at CVS/Pharmacy is working register and stocking merchandise. "
good,My typical workday consist of entering in patients medication and allergy information. Calculating dosages prescribed by doctors. Being able to work at a fast pace and also being accurate.
good,At cvs I learned many thing on order selecting and how to improve myself as a selector. The managers are nice and holds conversations with there employees to keep a great relationship with all. Everyone is treated with care and respect. The workers are cool some like to complain but I love meeting new people. I haven't really found a hard part in job because everything is fun and easy.
good,"A typical day at work includes,"
good,"Can get a little lonely- only one NP per clinic, and no support staff."
good,"Nice workplace depending on what region you are in. nice work environment. can be overwhelming after a while."
good,Working for CVS was and great and productive experience. My coworkers were all part of a team that helped contribute to a positive work atmosphere.
good,"Log into several systems, including the inbound telephony system. Speak with several federal pharmaceutical insurance program concerning new orders filled at either mail-order pharmacy or local retail pharmacy. "
good,Typical day at work is different every day. Some days we get our breaks and other days we don't. Love our customer base. The hardest part of my job is when our customers pass away. They need to pay more for the responsiblitys that the techs have.
good,Typical day is constantly busy and there is no set rules on who does what in the pharmacy. The ones who have been there longer get to choose where they work and new ones are put as cashiers. You do not get to become a tech here because you do no tech work.
good,"Work was faced pace for a retail job, consisted of really nice people and was well kept by management. would work there for retail if the money was better."
good,"I always work hard and usually enjoy a basic day at work, since I am not always doing the same things and I like do something different. I learned a lot about restocking and hanging sale signs. I also learned about how to operate photo machines and types of items we sell. I like all my co-workers and management treats me fairly. One of the hardest things about my job is learning how to give a customer what they need when they are really upset or angry without making it worse. I would say the most enjoyable part of my job would be seeing all the people I see every day that come in and talk to me or when I haven't seen them they say that they missed me and I feel like I have made a difference in their lives."
good,"I have a great team at CVS who does their best everyday to provide customers with efficient, and kind service.  I learn something new everyday from my co-workers about how to improve my job, and how to help customers better. The hardest part of my job would have to be juggling the different things we must deal with at once. Sometimes we will get about three phone calls at the same time, meanwhile a customer will drive up in lane one, and lane two, and someone will need service at the front counter.  Customer service is a priority to CVS so the customers in line come first, then the phones. This scenario provides quite the distraction though.  The most enjoyable aspect of this job has to be the people: both my coworkers and our regular customers.  I enjoy the conversation."
good,CVS/Pharmacy is an overall good field of work. The coworkers are nice and for the most part very helpful and willing to train you.
good,"In compliance department- I will start my day in collecting paper work from the other department for filing. Working on end of day report which take most of my day. Organizing them by prescription number order for filing. "
good,"My co-workers were some of the greatest people to work with.  Since we had the overnight shift we made the best of it. A typical day is customer service of ALL varieties.  The most difficult part of the job sometimes can be truck night when we would get sometimes 2,000 pieces to shelve and stock. The most enjoyable part of the day was 8:00am."
good,It's an ok job managment was nice co workers were great the benefits were pretty good advanced in the company was there if you willing to go to school for certain positions.
good,"typical work day sometimes 10-14 hours"
good,"My day would start by checking the board to see where I was stationed. Then I would start typing patient's information; such as insurance information, the medicine the Dr. prescribed, how often the medicine needed to be taken and scanned it into the scanner for the pharmacist to see. When I got caught up with the daily prescriptions, I would assist in dispensing the prescriptions, running the registers and answering phone lines. My co-workers were great to be around. I learned a lot of information I didn't know from them; such as what the medicine was used for or how often it could be used. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy customers. Whether something was wrong with the insurance they provided, the medicine wasn't in stock, or the medicine couldn't be dispensed yet. The most enjoyable part was all the customers I met. You learn something new from them every time they came in. I also loved that we stayed busy, there was never a time when we weren't."
good,"It is a job, there are too many restrictions for it to be a great job. The job is not what my certification says it should be."
good,"Good, learned a lot, nothing about the job was hard, great customer"
good,"CVS Is a great place to work if you plan on moving up in a company. Also, since CVS is located in so many places it is a great place to work if you were planning on relocating in the future. The management is not the best but they are working to improve. The hardest part of the job is being able to multi task and do several things at once while keeping your customer No. 1. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working with the public. I love people and I love to smile a smile on others faces."
good,"I learned a lot at CVS, especially how to let the patient when they called in for their meds. I love how I got to help people and how  my co-worker would help you when you needed it"
good,"CVS is a great place to meet all kinds of personalities.  Learning how to deal with irate customers and friendly customers is happens on a daily basis.  There is never a dull moment when you work with public.  The management cares about its employees in some ways, and in others not so much.  If you are a steady church-goer or family oriented, expect to have to work on holidays and church days.  There is no closing down the store in observation of Christian holidays.  The coworkers are friendly and work well most of the time. The hardest part of my job is not being able to meet other obligations that have been made to my church and family life. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to meet diverse people."
good,I definitely love the field in general. I enjoy working for CVS and my coworkers. I am always learning about new drugs and protocols for insurance and I love continuing to learn. Its fast paced and high volume and I enjoy the rush. I enjoy all my regulars and getting to know people. Its a great field and great learning place.
good,I worked as a customer service call center representative.  I answered on average 150-200 calls per day from clients asking about insurance plans for prescription  coverage.  I enjoyed talking to clients.  I was the top customer service representative on my team.
good,"CVS Pharmacy was my first Pharmacy Technician job I had, so needless to say I had to get my ""feet wet"" in the position. A typical day at the CVS where I worked was ""very busy"".  There were stations that all employees where assigned Fill, Drop-Off and Pick-up. I enjoyed being at Drop-off because it was where you learned the most and you were exposed to everything."
good,"It's an alright company to work for ive been there for a long time and didnt have to many concerns."
good,"For anyone still in high-school, this is probably one of the best jobs you can get.The pay isn't the most esteemed but the hours are flexible and the job isn't too demanding."
good,"Nice place to work. Opportunities for advancement are good.  Great benefits This company does not offer relocation cost, however they compensate fair for the cost of living."
good,"Pharmacy technician management"
good,"Everything is good except, one thing, i dont want the management to see my review, i learned a lot, by a lot, i mean everything i need to know in the pharmacy as a pharmacy technician. this store is hybrid of all pharmacy, Retail,mail-order,specialty pharmacy,"
good,"A typical day at work was very busy we handled more than a thousand scripts a day customer service was wonderful, I learned to use the perscription computer and labeling station to which I was used to doing everything by had. My co-workers were great, my managers allowed me overtime when available some of my managers were mean and unorganized but I did what was needed and required and kept my customers happy. The hardest part of my job was when I worked late at night and one of my co-workers didn't show up so I had to cover drive-thru and front counter and put in scripts cause we had a new pharmacist who knew little. I was so tired but I hung in there as long as my shift would allow. The best part of my job is my co-workers, helping people, and learning new things."
good,I learned a lot about drugs and different insurances about patients. I learned to use HIPPA so i don't disclose any personal information about our customers. The co-workers are very friendly and we work together to get everything done on time. I'm very happy at this place.
good,This fast paced work environment taught me how to work quickly but effectively. Management encouraged everyone to have a fun filled day at work!
good,It's a nice company to work for  but they will fire you for no reason
good,"advanced management of multiple task at one time, along with directing the whole team on what to do. Hands on experience with customers. Reatil pharmacy is a fast paced type of job and usually pharmacist work long shifts"
good,"Receptionist, greeting prospective student,processing payments, filling. Coworkers are awesome."
good,"I worked out in the field. I called on existing clients and prospected new business. Relationships with your clients is very important. You have to have entegrety. I learned that not all issues can be settled timely and it takes follow up and follow thru to find the right solutions."
good,"Very busy pharmacy to work at, you learn a lot of things; how to maintain lines, provide best customer skills, and a lot of terminology. Everyday you must be at the top of your game, and must be able to swiftly make it through your day. Although some days were rough in the end it was a very enjoyable job."
good,call center interacting with customers was really importatnt
good,"Our store is very fast pace which i am used to, so i caught right on. No i don't like the hours, but the pay rate is great to me!"
good,A typical day at work consists of making corrections to existing customers Medicare plans and calling them to make sure that the changes were necessary and accurate.
good,"Professional, work/life balance, training opportunities, work from home options."
good,"As I show up each day I am immediately thrown into the fast pace at the dispensary. Each moment is usually one where I have to juggle several tasks at once. However I am grateful I was exposed to such an environment as I am now confident I can function in any high volume pharmacy. Additionally the pharmacy has a lot of foreigners as customers, particularly from Europe and the Caribbean, so having a knowledge of pharmacy from these areas gives me an advantage. As such being able to interact and give advice to customers is the part which I enjoy the most. The hardest part of my day on the other hand is probably being on my feet all day, but that's part of the job so proper shoes is essential."
good,"i would describe a typical day at work as challenging, busy and producive. I learned how to use time management more proficiently, mutli-task, work harder under pressue, and maintain composure under stress."
good,"hectic schedule, but good pay and benefits.  Some weeks would run close to 60 hours but I have been told that problem has solved itself over the last few years."
good,Learn about all different costumer. Always came to work with positive attitude and  a smile. There was nothing hard at work but it was a challenge. I manage the register and payroll. When the pharmacist was on vacation ill be the one in charge of all the paperwork. The most I enjoy in my job is helping those in need and my assistance. As my co worker couldn't asked for better manager and co workers I had.
good,"Even with the high volume of work, our team works very well together."
good,A typical day is working under pressure trying to make every customer happy. Everyone I work with is pretty friendly and understanding so we always work as a team. Management is always helpful even when there busy. I would say the hardest part of the job is trying to assist customers when they are yelling at you. Overall the most enjoyable part of the job is learning about the new changes and drugs as they come out.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of high prescription and customer request volumes. Through CVS I've gained valuable knowledge of medications, insurances, and a higher value for customer service. I loved the management staff and co-workers I worked with daily. There was not much I found difficult working with CVS, the most enjoyable part was working with a highly motivated team and staff."
good,I work 2nd shift and a typical day is working anywhere from 6 or 8 hours to maybe 10 or 12 hours a day. The hours do vary a lot depending on the volume of work and time of year. I learned to do a couple different jobs since I started. The management is good and they communicate pretty good. Hardest part of the job is working so many hours everyday when It gets heavy but the coworkers are great and help the time go by better. Most enjoyable part of the job is being around the other workers.
good,"A typical day was answering 100 to 150 calls, I learned a lot about insurance. I had 3 supervisors in 2 years and loved all them they were always willing to listen and provide support. The hardest part of my job was dealing with upset customers, but I would just let them vent there anger and listen so I could provide a solution to whatever the problem was. I really enjoyed helping people and solving problems."
good,"*Assisting our members with the prescriptions, whether it be if a medication is covered or how to start mail order through their plan. Also enrolling people into a Part D plan, for their initial election period, special election period or annual enrollment period. "
good,"A typical day at work for me is (coffee first) then to check emails, make a plan of which territory to focus on, check in with team members for any priorty issues, meet with families, meet with Pharma Reps., research resources to provide families, attend national meetings. "
good,A great place to work with excellent opportunity to advance.  A typical day involves touring a store and looking for opportunities regarding compliance.  I get to work with some great forward thinkers and I have the opportunity to try new things that make my position more effective.  The hardest part of the position is the travel sometimes required for the role.
good,Depending on your location CVS can be a great place to work I have transferred from multiple locations across the  country and each experience has been different.
good,is a great way to develop skill in communication and increasing a amount of experience in customer services.
good,"Typical work day is busy, calls constantly coming in.  I learned so much about different prescription drugs and how they are filled.  Also how Medicare Part D works.  Co-workers were great.  Hardest part of job was the constant schedule changes."
good,"- worked weekend"
good,"-Relatively busy most of the time"
good,"Overall, this is a great place to work. Salary is a little on the low end, but it's great to have a job."
good,"It was a job that I had for 20+ years and enjoyed , I had a great time of leaders and co-workers. I traveled a lot, but loved it"
good,Was able to learn different types of medicine and learn terms of the medicine field
good,"Come in, sit and turn computer on and just start taking calls, all in coming through a dialing system. Did this daily for 8 hours. The hardest part of the job was just that, sitting for long hours taking calls until your breaks and lunch."
good,"I actually love working here. I look forward to each day I am scheduled.  Of course, every job has its moments.  However, even on the worst days there is a sense of teamwork and that we are in it together."

good,"Temp to hire staffing agency"
good,good training for a call center job. they worked around my school schedule.
good,"Being able to work with Coram Health Care really helped me learned a lot in what they do. It doesn't matter what job title I worked as I was able to learn so much from pharmacist, nurses, admissions, etc. There are hard times when I did not know what to do when a certain caller ask a question that I can not comprehend, but I manage to ask my co-workers or manager to help me. A typical day at work for me is sometimes doing the same thing everyday with my job. Most of the time I would try to find something new and challenging for myself. I enjoy work because knowing that everyone is a hard worker and they just always work in a team, that is what I like about Coram."
good,A typical day at work was very busy; fast pace but enjoyable! I learned a lot about time and office management. Co-workers were very friendly. Hardest part about the job was management was very disassociated; it was more of a leave a voice mail if you needed or had any questions and wait a few weeks for a response.
good,"Good experience, positive outcome. Everyone was nice, manager made it a fun experience for everyone. We were 90% of the time number one in the district of 18 stores."
good,The  staff at CVS is amazing. Very helpful. A typical day includes going to a store and setting merchandise. the most enjoyable part is being able to learn something new every day and meeting new people every day.
good,Pharmacy tech: little room for advancement beyond lead tech; benefits are ok
good,"Processing the tasks was easy, it was a professional enviroment. Love the supervisors, and the team."
good,I loved some of the pharmacists in this company. They were a complete joy to work with. Fellow coworkers were also very pleasant and helpful.

good,"Great place to work and great people to work with, lots of team activities, benefits and employee incentives"
good,Collections. Learned how the collections world works and operates.
good,"it was fun"
good,"I was hired on only as a temp until the other person came back from maternity leave. I wanted some learn more from this company. I learned about how to really look into claims. I would have to try and figure out way claims were denied, partially paid, and aged accounts. The hardest thing about the job was that everyone was busy and I didn't get the proper training. Everyone was so nice they tried to help even though they were busy."
good,Learning the procedures for billing medication and medical supplies and keeping knowledge updated on policies and  Federal/State laws was enjoyable.  Working with people that was helpful both in the office and over the phone. Gaining understanding of how facilities worked and provided care to residents along with providing my services to ensure products were available gave a feeling of satisfaction.
good,"At CVS Caremark employees are expected to strictly adhere to his/her schedule. Punctuality is key, following closely behind is production. Basically if you will have problems being there on time everyday from the start of the day till the end,( breaks and lunch included) and keeping up with daily production requirements then this place will not suit you well.  Other than that it is a solid company to work for!"
good,"CVS is a stable company, their take on customer service is different from mine.  They want the best customer service, and want to save as much on payroll as they can.  A typical day, at any given time there was a manager/supervisor and one cashier on duty to handle all the customers and day to day tasks."
good,Its a great work place with lot of advancement opportunities and great supporting staff
good,i really enjoyed working for cvs and the customers were amazing
good,"A typical day work consisted of arriving at 8am  work started immediately and it was constant all day long  On average we filled between 400 and 500 prescriptions a day  Most of the time I worked 8/10 hours per day but would often work open to close, which was from 8am to 9pm  I didn't mind because although I was on my feet all day, time passed very quickly, due to the fact that we stayed so busy  I worked in a small town and the family atmosphere was very rewarding  I loved seeing the smile on customers faces when we were able to resolve issues for them"
good,"I like the people I got to work with and my boss."
good,CVS is a good company to work for. You are compensated well for your time. The best part is getting to know your customers and their families. The hardest part of the job is when budget hours are cut.
good,"Higher pay scale"
good,"Huge call center but ""family like"" feel. Co-workers are very helpful, always overtime offered. Benefits are expensive yet multiple alternatives are offered. Insurance based company"
good,Shifts range from 7-14 hours. Strong Teamwork.  The hardest part is the script volume at most stores.
good,"I scheduled all pharmacy tech staff, and supervised all their reviews. I also made sure we made every scheduled delivery of pharmaceutical medication."
good,"It is very nice working environment"
good,This was very fast paced. I enjoyed working with all the customers and staff. I worked the window and helped people as the came to drop or pick up prescriptions. I entered orders and also fixed insurance problems.
good,Opportunity to develop business strategies and relationships with health care facilities who depend on life saving/enhanced quality of life products for their customers.
good,My pharmacy is very busy. On average 300+ Rx per day and at least half of those are on Medicare or some government assistance. Old people as well. Lot of dealing with insurances and filling Rxs but sometimes customers can get nasty. Nice people to work with and system works well.
good,"The best part of working in a retail pharmacy is getting to know the customers. Throughout the day, we are continually being told how much our customer's enjoy being around us. Typically, I open the store and handle the inventory management duties. Doctor calls and managing patient's profiles is a common occurrence."
good,"On a normal day at CVS Pharmacy, a patient will drop their prescription off, a doctor would call in a prescription for a patient, prescriptions can come through electronically or through fax. I would then type the prescriptions into the computer under the patients correct name and date of birth, I would then run it through the insurance make sure there isn't any issue and if so I would then call the patient and inform them on the issue, whether the insurance company does not pay for it or might require a prior authorization. If there are any other problems I would then call the insurance company to find out what the issue is and how we can resolve it. After the issue has been resolved and I contact the patient again and let them know what happened and how much their co-pay is, I then go to the production area to fill the prescription, count the tablets make sure the NDC matches the NDC on the bottle, scan the bottle on the computer then slap a label on the vial and pass it to the pharmacist to he/she can verify everything and the prescription is complete and ready for pickup. "
good,nice work environment with commitment to provide good costumer service
good,"Can be overwhelmingly busy and faceless at times, but the goals of the company are very good."
good,"When working at a retail pharmacy you day is unpredictable.If you work in a high or low volume pharmacy, work can be enjoyable especially if you have a good staff. I've had the pleasure of working in lots of different pharmacies within my district and have met very interesting people along the way. The hardest part of the job is when you work at a higher volume store and the pharmacy is understaffed.. so the pressure to get things done becomes overwhelming. The most enjoyable part of the day is when an issue is resolved and the patient is very thankful that you could help them get their necessary medication."
good,"A typical day is going to multiple stores to watch for potential shoplifters in the mirrors in the ceiling. Most of the time you are just standing around waiting, but are not allowed to do anything else in case of missing something."
good,"Enormous selections of daily items you need all in one store."
good,"Great place to work if you don't mind working nights, weekends, and holidays."
good,"As soon as you arrive to work you have to get right in the groove. "
good,"you answer incoming phone calls to assist customers with the CVS.com and CVSPhoto.com website. You assist customers with navigation, placing online orders and product inquires."
good,good company to work for co-workers were wonderful. typical work day included 100+ prescriptions our pharmacy was located in a medical building wich ment it would always be a fun busy day. work flow alway fast pace
good,"A typical day at work would be orienting a new employee on policies and protocols, new hire documentation, benefits and employee expectations.  Bi-weekly payroll would be calculated for all employees and submitted into the Lawson system.  Other duties would include ensuring that the branch invoices would be reviewed for accuracy, approved and forwarded to the corporate office for payment.  "
good,"It was a very nice place to work. I worked from 11:00 to 3:00 . I had alot of nice co workers, My Boss was very nice."
good,working here made going to school and raising a child less stressful which was important at the time but now its time to begin my career.
good,Great programs but need more ancillary help to make them work properly.
good,A great team to be a part of. Look for substantial growth in the future.
good,"The crew I work with are all great and we get along fine, however some customers are very argumentative and the management make scheduling mistakes."
good,"My management team and coworkers work well together. A larger staff to complete the daily/weekly/monthly assignments our location has would definitely be an improvement on not only our productivity, but also on our customer service."
good,I enjoyed working there. I did everything from stocking inventory to keeping the financial books up to date. My co-workers were very friendly but the management could have tried to be more humane. The hardest part of this job was unloading the truck at three in the morning every Friday. The most enjoyable part was getting to help people with their needs and putting smiles on their faces.
good,"Caremark Therapeutic Services helped me to refine my skills in electronic claims processing and allowed freedom to interact with patients, doctors and co-workers to provide assistance to patients for aftercare. Their computer systems were very easy to manage which allowed me time to speak with patients regarding balances, additional needs, and future endeavors. I learned about many different forms and types of medications because Caremark Therapeutic Services is a pharmacy. I also learned how patients benefit from the medicines provided by Caremark Therapeutic Services and how the help from co-workers and myself impacted patients lives. The hardest part of the job proved to be satisfying because it consisted of securing approval and payment from insurance provisions to get the best and quality care for our patients. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving photos from patients while they progressed in life knowing that our pharmacy played an intricate part in improving quality of life for many."
good,"A typical work day for busy season is a crazy one with the flu shots, transferring medications in for snow birds, to the long lines and trying to help each patient as fast and accurately as possible. You always learn something knew whether it be a new shortcut on the computer system or how to find insurance company's. I think the hardest part of the job would be trying to help patients, and considering their point of view, but when their medications are not ready they yell at you and sometimes cuss at you. I sometimes think how can you do that to someone they don't even know? I work in a retirement community so most of our patients are over the age of 65 years. Co-workers are great when they don't bring their problems to work and I think it would be efficient and polite and try and not to have a personal conversation while helping patients. Management is ok but my pharmacist in charge is a push over and his boss is as well I think. Had one employee cost the CVS/PHARMCY not our store but corporate over $5,000 in a legal matter and he didn't get fired for it just transferred to a new store. Even though our patients do have their moments I love seeing our patients and seeing them smile and making them smile because to some of our patients we are the only interaction they have."
good,"Retail pharmacy. Help customers with prescriptions, fill prescriptions, manage inventory. Learned the front end of dispensing medications to customers. In store management was good, but corporate management are heavy and strict. Co-workers were ok at my store. The hardest part was managing new tasks that company launched adding on top of what we need to do in less time and labor. The most enjoyable was having to interact with co-workers in store and serve the customers."
good,"I enjoy working at CVS.  The pharmacists are professional, yet fun to work with.  They really care about the technicians.  I enjoy my coworkers - we really can work well together as a team in this high pressure environment."
good,"I was the billing manager for the medical products division over 8 customer service reps. I was responsible for complete and accurate claim billing, the posting of accounts receivable, the training of all new employees, also responsible for keeping employees up to date on Medicare guidelines and any other payer changes necessary. Coached and encouraged employees as needed, tracked employee time worked, did yearly evaluations and made recommendations to division manager for pay increases. My co workers, we worked as a team each was considerate of the other, we all got along well, which made the office function really well. The hardest part was I worked for a nation wide company where all of the accounts receivables went to a corporate bank account, we then had to track down our branches AR and then post to our accounts. The most enjoyable part of this job was the people I worked with and the customers we served. I enjoyed talking with our customers and being able to help them with billing questions, reimbursement issues and any other concerns they had."
good,"You work with great people. The environment is good, communication is good with management or employees"
good,"A typical day at cvs is filling prescriptions and answering the phone, cvs is the first pharmacy I worked in. The managers where very nice, the hardest apart is dealing with unhappy people, but I enjoy working in a pharmacy."
good,"At my current job, everyday i interact with customers, file data entry into the computer and make sure i am dispensing medications as prescribed. I am preparing the process for the pharmacist to verify in order for the customers to purchase medicine. While working at CVS, i have learned that communication and teamwork is most important and making sure data entry and information is being process accurately and in an organized manner. Customer satisfaction is the number one priority. The management at my job is great. Everything is done both effectively and efficiently and also tasks are done as planned.

good,"I absolutely love my position with this company the only downfall is that the hours are not compatible with daycare. Wonderful place, wonderful people ."
good,CVS Pharmacy has great training programs for front store staff. I started out as a front store supervisor and was moved to Loss Prevention when the position came open. I was partially trained for this position for two weeks. The hardest part of this job is simply doing the job with only partial training.
good,I like the company but for the work that is required and little help I believe  technicians get under paid

good,"Retail pharmacy is not for everyone. It can be quite difficult at times but essentially helping people is rewarding. Its a fast paced work environment which makes the time fly by.

good,"Typical day at work would be interacting with customers, specially the ones who are unsatisfied with the products. "

good,Hardest part of my job is dealing with patients all day and keeping my cool throughout.
good,"A decent job with lots of opportunities for advancement, but the attitude of the workforce makes it feel the same as a high school, extremely strict attendance policies, and some minor things given to the employees such as a ping pong table and an overpriced cafeteria. Lots of politics and favoritism."
good,"A easy going and relax day at work. Smile and greet all customers, go in early so you can go home early."
good,I've been an employee at CVS/Caremark since july 2007. I have to say I've learned alot and have dealt with different personalities. I have also had the ablilty to be cross trained in many different areas. I'm happy I had a great team of mannager and co-workers that were willing to teach.
good,-Meeting or exceeding Beauty department sales and service targets
good,My overall review about CVS Pharmacy is that I am thankful that they granted me the opportunity to develope good skills in the pharmacy field. I went in not knowing anything about medication and they granted me that opportunity to go beyond and certified me with my Pharmacy technician license.
good,"A typical day at CVS begins with filling overnight scripts called in, receiving and taking care of faxes from MD, insurance companies, or other pharmacies, filing paper work, vaccinating, inventory management & counseling patients. Since being with CVS, I've learned how to administer a vaccine, take care of patient problems, counsel patients on over the counter medications, side effect management and disease state management. My co -workers are quick learners, very efficient at assisting the pharmacist, and bring liveliness to the pharmacy. The hardest part of the job is not being able to fill a patient's prescription according to certain laws, knowing that the patient needs it. The most enjoyable part of the job is administering vaccines to patients."
good,"I really enjoyed working with patients and the public in general. I was responsible for obtaining prescriptions, filling them and processing insurance payments."
good,"Great and a busy workplace. It's fast paced and pharmacists are under a lot of stress. The supervisor is a micro manager but that's his way of getting things done, I guess."
good,"Not a bad place to work, unless you want to have a life. Always learning something new, and fast paced. Customers were pleasant, but some could be moody."
good,"I come into work and set up the photo lab for the day and start on any important paperwork or shipment that need to be done. The hardest part of the job is probably shipment day, when we get a ton of bins of inventory that needs to be put up in that day. Other than that I love my job, I like meeting/talking to new people and trying to brighten their day!"
good,"we have a variety of customers and we are opened 24 hours so we have all types of people.I have learned to have a lot of patience with all types of people.our store is a training store so all our managers are taught before they are sent to have their own store,we have some very nice managers.I have coworkers from all over the world so we can see how others live.The hardest part of the job is we dont have a set schedule you get use to one time and they change your schedule.The most enjoyable part of the job is that I have met people who are customers that have become regulars in the store and I believe they feel good about cvs because of my customer service"
good,"Love the co-workers but the work flow is such a headache.. literally! i gained weight, became depressed, and committed social suicide!! However, if the work flow becomes better managed, i would definitely reapply!"
good,"*Customer service representative in CVS corporate privacy department. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to, answering incoming calls from customers requesting prescription record information; providing status checks for lawyers and other facilities; routing calls to appropriate departments when necessary.

good,"Answering phones all day literally, Learned all different kinds of medication, co-worker were fun to work with. The hardest part of the day was more towards the end. enjoyable part of the day was when we first got there"
good,"Besides the routine tasks of training, cashier, stocking, label-posting, price changes, etc., dealing with the customers was probably where I got the most enjoyment from."
good,"The shift stars with a group meeting the supervisor, he talks about news and expectations. We then proceed to our work areas to pick store orders, which consists of reading from a list, counting the right amount, and bending and reaching to pick then lifting trays up to 35 pounds. The shift ends with cleaning."
good,"n estos trabajos se comparte mucho con la comunidad, lo cual se hace un proceso retroalimentador, ademas adquiere mucha experiencia y dejas satisfechos a quien prestas el servicio."
good,"Started the day reviewing KPIs and all stats had been collected.Organised workflow.and appropriate personnel were correctly placed.Reviewed Prescriptions and counselled patients.Contacted Drs when there were possible drug interactions,contraindications or other problems such as having a med changed to one that was covered by the patients insurance."
good,My experience was really good here. They had a good management crew when I was there and the pay was pretty good.
good,Overall CVS/Caremark is a good place to work. The culture and work environment are both above average and the management team is fair and balanced.
good,cashing people out
good,"Not much room for advancement. A typical day is normally busy, however it is never predictable."
good,The staff is a bit lazy. I enjoyed managing. I was very young and gained a lot of real world knowledge. I am very ready to be apart of a new team. The store was an overnight store so the hours were great. There was limited advancement available.
good,an easy steady work flow
good,I worked in productions where i had to re fill prescriptions
good,"At the beginning a typical day at work was wonderful, I was proud to be employed, and felt for once that all my hard work actually had paid off each day I preform my duties. The appreciation soon decreased once the lead pharmacist had stepped down form the lead and another took the position. This Pharmacist would constantly talk much negligence about me loudly to the surrounding employees. Showing a side of her that is somewhat nefarious and truly consist upon nonprofessional ethics. Furthermore, the feeling of aloof, I was uncomfortable in my surroundings. My co-workers on the other hand, were very nice and had manners as well one should. Being able to get along with them was easy and at times became helpful when questions needed answering. The hardest part of the job was having to explain insurance rejections or any money related problems to customers when they do not understand as to why this particular situation is happening. Most of the customers believe that the reason has something to do with the pharmaceutical computer systems when in fact it has to do with their insurance company declining their item or such similar situations. The most enjoyable part of the job was the respect I had for myself."
good,I was a long-term employee with CVS Caremark. I lost my job due to a layoff/facility reorganization. The company I started with was Advance Paradigm. This company went through many transitions and the last was most challenging. I learned many things during my tenure and was well compensated. In the end the company selected to slash costs and my layoff was one of the results.
good,"A great experience learning all facets of pharmacy insurance and mail order pharmacies. Also, received helpful content through additional on-going training and information classes. Enjoyed the opportunity to advance to the specialized Medicare D team and providing information to customers, pharmacies, doctors, co-workers and supervisors. Hardest part of the job was when Caremark merged with CVS and closed our California location."
good,"Loved working in the pharmacy. Obtained for CPT license while working there. Very fast-paced and enjoyable. Sometimes it would get super busy and stressful, but service was always done with a smile."

good,Entered purchases into the computer and processed payments.
good,Delegate task for the best work flow and have rx ready when promised. I learned how to be a great team leader and manage the pharmacy without any problems . Hardest part about this job is to work straight 14 hrs without a break and still put in your 100% in everything you do. I love the winter as its Flu shots time! Love to give out flu shots.
good,"Knowing what your customers needs, was like a daily routine. Building a rapport with each staff member, and customer. Co-workers at CVS always came together and pulled out some very hard days when its like everything seems like its going wrong. Having strong team players made the job and its stress all worth it."
good,"I was only an intern so most of what i did was pre-packaging drugs into 30 day cards. other techs spent their time filling actually prescription orders. when i started at this facility they had two other techs, but soon they let them go because their projected profits did not add up. this is hen everything began to roll down hill and out of control. it didnt take long for the pre packs to pile up, and soon it became impossible to keep up. My co-workers were great, very friendly and helpful. they would always ask if they could do anything to help when they had time. the hardest part of my job was keeping up with all the pre packs i had to do. the most enjoyable part of my job was the feeling of accomplishment i got when i would finish a good amount of pre packs in one day."
good,* Having to work more unpaid hours after regular work hour to finish all the the that hasto be done and more!
good,very well thought out warehouse
good,As a primarily customer service business the individual experience largely depends upon the disposition of the team. This group worked very well both professionally and personally. Though many of the team hae moved on since my last date of employment at CVS I would work with that same group anytime.
good,Working here is like having a new adventure everyday. Each day is new and completely unique. Plenty of learning experiences and opportunities to show personal strengths.
good,Numbers get in the way of caring for patents. Other than that the day to day is routine. Sells and filling prescriptions.
good,"A typical day at work at this job consist of filling perscriptions, alot typing on the computer,and dealing with alot of customers. I learned alot about medications, I learned how to deal with different type of people, and learned how to be patient with people while working at this job. The management at this job was good but I thought it could've been alot better. My co-workers was like family alot this job I met alot of people that became very close friends to me at this job. The hardest part of this job was telling customer's we didn't have a medication in stock, because sometimes the customer would try and make scene in front of pharmacy just to get attention. The most enjoyable part of this job was information I was learn about how the pharmacy and insurance companies worked."
good,"Typical day is never typical....always something new, customers are priority number 1. Ive learned to deal with people with respect and compassion. Management is always looking for ways to improve the customer experience. My co-workers are like my second family, some have even become great friends of mine. hardest part of this job is being away from home and always giving 100% even if I dont feel like it sometimes. Most enjoyable part is the satisfaction of making someones day feel much better in some way, shape or form."
good,Learner about specialty/mail order pharmacy. Did everything from calling patients pulling picking packing and shipping orders.
good, Received and made inbound and outbound calls to patients and various medical facilities in regards to specialty therapies provided
good,"Job is very redundant, but hours are consistent. Co workers are friendly but managers are strict."
good,"a typical day at work, is vary fast paced. I learn all about drugs.management and co-worker are great. the hardest part is getting the work out the door. The enjoyable part is finishing the job."
good,chance to chat w/coworkers
good,very professional atmosphere. got to learn a lot about pharmacy and their products.
good,"I enjoy seeing many of our customers. I like the feeling, at the end of the day, that I've helped people. I work with nice people, as well."
good,"Oversee stre operations, proactive customer service environment, training simulations and continued employee development"
good,Weekly status meetings are cool.
good,"It was a fast- paced environment from the entry until the exit. I have learned to do minor mixtures, inventory, pharmacy billing and I have gained great customer service skills through it. It was a nice place to work, and there was great teamwork. The hardest part of the job was having a customer leave dissatisfied, but I truly enjoyed helping the customers."
good,Management a bit old school but if a person shows up on time and is prepared to work the job is a cinch.
good,"I prepares I.V. syringes, antibiotics, chemotherapy, and 3 others and myself worked as a team to make large bags of liquid nutrition to be delivered to very ill people no longer at hospitals but has these orders delivered to ther homes. I worked evening shift so I has to clean all the equiptment spotless before ending the day."
good,The pharmacy tech job is actually very easy to learn. And they pay you through all of your training and help you get nationally certified. The company itself was good to work for but part time benefits aren't even worth getting. Hard to get hours sometimes and hours can vary as much as 15-20 hours some weeks. Overall of you have a good crew and a decent pharmacist it is an enjoyable place to work.
good,Certain members of management not up to par but most of the coworkers were okay. Hardest part of the job is getting used to the fast pace. You have to have your game face on and be ready to work when you arrive.
good,"Enjoyed the people I worked with; the only reason I left was because the company was changing over to a courier service where the drivers were to be subcontractors, and I didn't want to use my own vehicle to make deliveries. It also would have complicated my income tax filing at the end of the year, and I thought this was not worth it for a part-time job. If it was full-time, I may have considered it, but I already had a full-time job as a contract driver employee for the Postal Service."
good,"I enjoy the field in which CVS/Pharmacy relates, however always being shorthanded presented challenges in making customers happy at my particular store that I worked for. Management was decent and I enjoyed making people happy. Everyday you learned a new experience."
good,I enjoyed working for CVS. Very challenging assignments and great co-workers.
good,"The company is great, Their benefits are awesome.One of the coolest things about CVS Pharmacy is that thye have extra bucks which gives you instore cash to spend on other items that you may need."
good,very nice staff and laid back environment. managment is good.
good,Good because i was a young guy and it taught me how to interact with people and speak better.
good,"CVS/Caremark is a good employer, allows you to manage you own time and your own work. The work load is not extreme and bearable."
good,"In the five years I worked for CVS, I was able to move up from Pharmacy Tech to Lead as well as the ability to float at times."
good,I like the work and the people but the compensation and benefits aren't so great.
good,"Was good at times, but the company does not factor in productivity of a pharmacy. Even though we worked in one of the busiest stores in Michigan we were compensated the same as if we worked in the slowest store in Michigan. We were unable to sit down during shifts."
good,"My employees were respectful in there own way, we would not have trouble with making a costumer feel like we couldn’t help them. Some costumers would bring bad actions I would keep it calm and be understanding."
good,The office is fairly typical. It has cubicles with multiple kitchens with vending machines. The only negative is that these kitchens did not have freezers.
good,"The data science team in CVS is in its peak development era."
good,"When busy, long hours. Always have weekends off. Union hall, seniority prevails. Be prepared to possibly work the yard hostler at the beginning of your job experience here. Constant safety job training"
good,This particular call center had a lot of issues with upper management and issues with having their CSR's well equipped with knowledge. too many people honestly didn't know what they were doing and this caused unprofessionalism.
good,Great company to work for.   Flexible scheduling.   Knowledgeable and helpful staff members.    Friendly pharmacists.   Usually offers full and part time opportunities.
good,"always pulling 2 weeks worth of medication off shelf that has not been picked up yet and returning medication back to stock."
good,I was paid relatively well in the beginning. Was given opportunity to bounce around from various stores. Once I came in i found it hard to move up.  But my intention was always to move on to a different career.
good,"A typical day at work involves greeting customers at the door most of the time. It also involves signing customers up for a new membership cvs has launched called Carepass,"
good,"I worked here during my time at school  Not only did they worked with my schedule, they were able to provide me with the motivation to continue schooling. The management was all really great, as a warehousing job it can be a bit demanding at times for second shift, but definitely an overall good work experience."
good,CVS Pharmacy is the perfect place for ones balancing school and needing money to pay for necessities. Multitasking is needed to do this job especially for ones working in a downtown location where you can speak to at least 100 customers a day
good,"Contractors will often get their contracts extended rather than converted to an FTE position. Other than that, it's a good place to work at if you're into being a part of the health industry one way or another."
good,not for the faint of heart or thin skinned. very fast paced as customers want their medications now esp went they don't feel well. must be thick skinned as many customers get rude and obnoxious. opportunity to learn a lot about medications and how they work
good,Patient care and counseling. I learn something new daily. management is supportive. Workplace  culture is open. Work is consistent with retail practice.
good,I succeeded there and the benefits were good.  My hours were the worse part of the position there.  It never changed in the four years of employment in specialty.
good,"One of the best thing about this place is the customers. Some will be a headache, but when you figure them out, they can be some of the best people. Keeps in mind you are dealing with them when they are at their worst (sick). No one is going to be happy, so figure out what they need and get them out the door. The next time you see them, they'll be glad to find you and the relationship is built. The company tends to be the wall between you and the customer, so find a way to work around it without breaking any company policies, thereby creating a great relationship with the customer, and making the company happy."
good,Company goal is to get all well trained to be able to apply principles within its four walls. While establishing this culture you will be able to assist customers and put them on a path to better health.
good,"Ok company to work for. No job advancement opportunities, great job focusing on wellness and work life balance. Great benefits and pay. Concerns with management."
good,In reality i enjoy dealing with members and making sure they have as easy as possible experience getting whatever prescriptions they need to maintain a good quality of life...
good,"The store was great to work at. Meet lots of kind people, learned to hone my socials skills. Learned lots from management & plus how to work effectively within a team."
good,"The company is great, they value hard-working and loyal employees. The interview process for a pharmacy technician is relatively easy, the only downside is that it may take months to get hired."
good,That specific cvs is a great place to work be cause of the employees. And 80% of the customers are great as well. And they work with you scheduling wise.
good,"I moved to the area to take this job in the pharmacy benefit manager segment of CVS. I support client-initiated audits which requires a great deal of documentation and research. Most difficult is the amount of work that is assigned. To meet deadlines, I find myself working more than five days per week. My colleagues are pleasant and helpful, and the environment is quiet."
good,"Cvs really cares about their customer/patients. At the Cvs i currently work at there’s no discrimination, there is no altercations between staff and managers, it seems that everyone gets along fairly well."
good,"I loved working in the pharmacy and our pharmacist that we had. It is a very fast paced environment, time seems to fly by. The only problem was after 5 years I was only making $9.75 an hour. I had my National certification and I was the stores Inventory specialist."
good,"Never had many issues, became a pharmacy technician within a year! Great manager, very flexible and kind. Coworkers always make you feel welcomed and appreciated"
good,Store level staff is friendly and nice and everyone works together as a team. Customers can be good and bad but that's like any location. Always expect the unexpected with customers.
good,"Getting scheduled for 8-16 hours of work one week & 30 the next, is not good for anyone trying to pay bills & keep ahead of  life’s schedule needs with very young children along with working every weekend for several months straight. When new employees join, they get weekends off all the time, especially if they make the scheduler their best friend."
good,"Front register associate who processes transactions including both store"
good,"Seriously one of the best & worst experiences I’ve had was here at CVS Pharmacy. Once I was settled in-we became a family. I LOVED all of the other techs and pharmacists."
good,They're really thorough with their interview has been a very great experience so far working for this company. Will be referring a couple of friends to a different store.
good,"A typical retail managerial position in a healthcare environment. Top pharmaceutical innovative company, always updating their system to match industry leaders."
good,What can I say I worked with the company for a really long time. So many changes throughout the years. I am old Eckerd employee and learned a lot of new things throughout the years.
good,"Great company to work for, definitely makes a great first job! Room to move up and gain many different customer service skills along the way! A little repetitive in tasks but each day is different."
good,"Receive payments by cash , credit , cards , vouchers. Issue receipts, refunds, credits, or change due to customers.Count money in cash drawers at the beginning of shifts to ensure that amounts are correct and that there is adequate change ."

During my time at CVS I was able to strengthen my multi tasking abilities in both a slow and fast pace environment well still maintaining great customer service.

good,"Coworkers were friendly & helpful. Employees are eager to assist with a call or training you may need. Discounts @ CVS. Upper management is friendly as well. Paid holidays, PTO, & 4 - floating Holidays"
good,"Depends on the location. My last locations was awesome. The store manager was laid back and wanted to see people grow with the company. If you were working hard, he would pay you for your hard work(raise). He would work with your schedule, and wanted you to excel not just with the company but in life. My coworkers were full of drama but I stayed to myself."
good,"Is a great job if there is good management. Morale is very important especially between the pharmacist and technicians.Need to work together. For example, people at their stations needs to change stations every so often.The drawbacks are pharmacists only QV, even though there may be shortage of techs"
good,"We were a minimal hour store, so we had to be able to do a lot of multi tasking. Customer service was always our first priority. I worked with some amazing managers and learned new things from each one of them."
good,"CVS is a great company, unfortunately there is a few unrealistic expectations vs what costumers really want. Management often find loopholes or shortcuts in order to achieve corporate expectations."
good,During my time at cvs I ran into the first job in which customers would try to argue and pick fights with you which was the job that gave me a lot of patience with people but most importantly I liked it because I got to help people with their needs
good,"Company is good if you are starting out as a pharmacy technician."
good,"Management showed a lot of appreciation to employees with an open door approach, many opportunities for overtime and just an overall positive environment."

good,Pretty cool job to have if you’re in school my experience were I barely had hours so it was kind of frustrating at some point but it also worked out for me when I was in school
good,"During my time at CVS, there were multiple opportunities to move up. There are pharmacy and management positions employees can pursue if the please. I received multiple pay increases during my two years there including an annual pay increase during the summer. The hours were what I asked for and it was never really a problem taking time off."
good,"I enjoyed working at CVS. If you enjoy a busy fast paced situation then this would be for you. I really didn’t want to leave CVS, but due to a personal injury away from work, I was no longer able to stand for long periods"
good,I enjoyed working here. My coworkers were kind and helped me learn what I needed to learn to do the job. Management has changed since I worked there but I never had any issues with that either. The pay was on the low side and at the time it was hard to get a full-time slot in order to get benefits. The worst part about working there was the customers. The best part about working there was the people I worked with.
good,"Overall great job, could definitely use better pay and better benefits for part time workers. Great management staff, always felt comfortable and enjoyed the environment!"
good,ON the beach great team interacting with customers team oriented family oriented love my coworkers they are like my family fast paced and the day goes by pretty quick
good,"I’ve worked at many locations. depends where but some can be fast paced and others slow. Learned how to restock, price changes. Management is okay can be better"
good,"The job itself can be pretty good, but the problem is that sometime managers can sometimes try to take too much advantage of the workers by not caring about them and trying to make them work when they have other things to do like personal things."
good,"A typical day at  CVS flutuates.We have the normal greeting customers, finding products, ringing up the purchases, customer service in various areas front store, photo and moneygram and restocking the store. The people that I work with are all very pleasant, friendly and helpful including the manager. The hardest part of the job is trying to deter theft. The most enjoyable is interacting with different people."
good,"Working at CVS really is all about how you make an impact while working, if you're good with the management life would be easier if not than otherwise."
good,Management knows how to accommodate employees schedule and fair to all workers at CVS and not showing any favoritism. Management know how to appreciate their employees hard work.
good,"Coram CVS offers workers who are proficient in Infusion services, both autonomy and flexibility. As a Case Manager, you and your client decide what works best."
good,"My experience at CVS has been up and down but im sure all jobs are full of ups and downs. The location i was at determined how the work day would be. The fact i learned how to deal with customers when things get bad, shows how much i have grown."
good,"It was a good company for me for many years. It became too busy and to focused in numbers at the end, but overall it was a good place to work. The benefits are really good and the choice of saving for retirement it was always available."
good,"Many corporate initiatives.  Overall a great company to work for.  Great benefits and Salary.  Work life balance has decreased though.  Engagement of employees has gone down a bit, but still a good place to work."
good,"Pros"
good,Opportunities for promotion . Employees were friendly and helpful. Good teamwork.Management was helpful. There w3as stress at times due to heavy workload and meeting deadlines.
good,we as a team got along and could easily bounce ideas off one another without judgement.management took all issues to heart and worked with you to promote positive actions for the employee and the business
good,"Never get to comfy, and always try to impress. youre always being watched.  Long hours, meaning you need to keep busy, and since its gonna be a long day, remember that people love to gossip when they are bored"
good,I feel advanced in m career after joining cvs/ omnicare. very organized work place.lot of learning opportunities. Get good raise based on performance.
good,"CVS is a very fast paced, welcoming environment. CVS challenges employees to learn everyday on the job and through monthly online assessments. The management is always willing to help and encourage employees to their fullest potential."
good,"Great Company to work for. Enjoyed my time there. Would recommend jobs to friends and family. Great benefits and pay offered. Opportunity for growth within the company,"
good,"Competitive environment for all managers, one area of improvement is maybe more experienced district managers. Bonus incentives are good as well, definitely room to grow"
good,The scope of my position is very limited and management wont divulge the store’s operational model. In order to become full time at my store i need to wait until such a position is offered and then apply for it even though Ive been here 3 years.
good,"Basic roles as a cashier, the con for this job is just standing at all times except breaks. Great management and coworkers when I was working there. Sometimes its busy at times not that much."
good,"CVS culture was about getting as much done with the least amount of resources, primarily payroll. A typical day as a store manager was trying to complete all your tasks in the first 4 hours as you would be working alone for the next 5-6 hours."
good,The CVS health career is an experience I won't ever regret I learned a lot about management I was also taught that health is a big part of the daily lives of every American the customers are great genuinely and the managers at the CVS store and the customer service representatives are so great and helpful kindness is a big part of the CVS store as well
good,"CVS is a very fast paced company. There is always stuff going on from costumers, sales, inventory, cleaning, ect. The company does well making its employees have an easy time with their benefits."
good,"CVS has a great atmosphere to work in but can be a little stressful when it's just you the front cashier working & the 1 manager taking care of the whole store & you are responsible for greeting, stocking shelves, keeping store & counter organized & helping all customers that need help and then checking them out at the registers."
good,CVS is an interesting workplace environment. I enjoy it some days but not everyday I work. Coupon customers can become redundant so patience is a must if you work here.
good,"CVS offers a good work environment and competitive pay. As a manager, I feel like an important part of the organization and my input in the daily operations of my store are greatly valued."
good,"Overall pretty good company to work for. Family feel, management was awesome, but like most companies corporate didnt really seem to care much. Budget cuts resulted in staff being spread thin."
good,I was so used to the work i did but it wasn't easy at cvs. loved the money but the stress was higher. my location was too far from home. if it was closer i would have been a lot more happier
good,"I enjoyed working here, my only issue was I had to work constistently to keep employeyment and when I went back to college I was not able to do so. Would recommend to others but I am looking for something more related to my future career as I am almost complete with my college career and ready to enter the workforce."
good,Be ready to work. level of hardship  depends on the location of your store. people were nice and friendly at my store. pay attention to the tranings. over all great experience.
good,"I liked working at CVS, it was a really good job. The only ""stressful"" part of it was dealing with rude couponers. Over all it was an easy job and I liked the people I worked with, We tried making it a fun workplace. My day consisted of straightening out the shelfs. Stocking, putting up the sale labels on Sundays and etc."
good,"Not many employees so you always have something to do. Responsible for cashier, cleaning store, doing stickers, showing people where stuff is, working in pharmacy, and even sweeping outside."
good,"I really enjoyed the customers that i met. I also loved the short shifts. I always appreciated the extra benefits."
good,"Day to day operations isn't bad, but you got to do your part if you want to move up the ranks. They compensate you for doing your part, and the customers love it when you help them out all the time."
good,I wasn't able to stay at the company due to 5he work environment. The company overall is a great company. If you are able to finish training I highly suggest to do so before you start working the floor.
good,"During 4 months of the year, each business is tasked with a large influx of work which involves tight turn-around-times. This often requires long days to accommodate. Most teams are understaffed for extended periods of time and this adds additional stress to employees."
good,I worked with this company for over 4 years and definitely learned a lot. They offer great vacation and sick time for full time employees. The only reason that I chose to leave was because the lack in decent pay raises.
good,"It was stressful because I had to do 7 different jobs by myself while taking care of customers. When I did have help at the front, my co-workers were lazy and not very helpful. It was fun because my managers were awesome to work with."
good,"I worked in a smaller CVS, but it was the type where everyone knew everyone. I usually worked the front, which was annoying when I had to run up while in the middle of stocking shelves. I'm usually pretty chipper and talkative, and some customers have enjoyed my attitude and chattiness."
good,"n/a. I love CVS diversity though, like any another business or, store, CVS has many Pros but definitely, on most days, CVS pros outweigh the cons. CVS is always innovating."
good,"Filling prescriptions are consistently routine, but the customers come in waves so it can be busy or slow.  Training within was good and the team had to really work together to get it all done."
good,"I began working at CVS due to a change in life. I was a single parent, very limited childcare, and needed an income but could not work typical work hours.  "
good,"It’s a fast paced environment, did well with catching up. There is plenty of room for growth within the company. I sure regret leaving from there. Management is well."
good,"CVS is very flexible with student schedules and strives to help them advance in their careers. They stand by customer service, which is one reason why I enjoy working for the company. Their only con is their starting pay."
good,You work autonomous with a lot of support.   30 hours per week is considered full time.  Great work/life balance.  And they recently had a pay increase in the state of NY.
good,"The company is a great company to work for.  Great pay, benefits and rewarding work. Everyone is like family.  You are provided the tools to advance within the company."
good,this was my first job so I had to be content with it but haven worked at other warehouses I believe they should increase pay but they are very organized and structured
good,"fast paced environment; certain areas kept to higher standards: i.e., Rx picking must be at 96% rate efficiency and 99.57% accurate while the main section is at 85% rate and 95% accuracy at the same pay.  I enjoyed the variety I had in my position, but it did not offer me a living wage as a single income household.  People who worked their with their partners enjoyed the $ with 2 paychecks.  Hard to get used to lower paychecks and not get paid every week."
good,"Good company with great benefits.  CVS gives you the ability to move up the ladder to become management.  The pay is good, and the employees are treated well."
good,A lot of focus and training is required in order to be successful and efficient as a pharmacy technician. There are many tasks that have to be done in a pharmacy daily and weekly and it takes a committed and determined individual to keep up with the pace.
good,It was a good simple job that treated me fairly. All the staff there was friendly. The manager there was also friendly and very leader like. Unfortunately I had to leave because I only had 100 hours.
good,"Lots of career opportunities. However, the reason why I left is because of the graveyard shift. I was assigned to work from 12:00am to 8:00am twice a week while the remaining three days I was assigned to work at random times (i.e., morning, daytime, and evening). Had it not been for this sudden schedule change due to lack of personnel, I would have not left CVS."
good,CVS was a great place to work. I believe it was sometimes under staffed. The ambient wasn’t the best to work at. It was great to have flexible hours for being able to work and study was a bonus.
good,CVS Health has a great foundations of leadership program designed to give high performing leaders the opportunity to gain key experiences that will better equip them for management roles.
good,Over all my position was part time interested in full time but it was no guarantee. It was a productive job. Friendly customers. High performance. Staff was very team oriented.
good,"The team I work with are professionals to the highest degree. Management is always attentive to their employees. It does get very busy, but the work is rewarding."
good,"Colleagues in West Union did a great job working as a team Wasnt much time to learn, so mistakes were made often Customers were hateful about mistakes"
good,"This job is great for part-timers and the pay is decent, however the work is tiring and requires physical fitness. It is a great opportunity if someone wants to work with the company as a pharmacist in the future."
good,Good workplace. Sometimes the pharmacist seems to stress out even though they have a day off every other day. Less Pharm tech in most pharmacy. Weren't paying to well in the pharmacy.
good,"I learned how to work in a hectic and demanding environment  which demanded of me to push myself to limits i didn't know I had, The job helped me get my foot of the ground and show me how working is rough but beneficial."
good,"Must be able to learn different skills in order to advance."
good,"The ITSC at CVS is wonderful. The management team created a very supportive environment, and allowed for camaraderie as well as the best team I've had the pleasure of being a part of."
good,Great for new graduates with guidelines in place to expand knowledge in many areas of patient care. Colleagues always willing to help and support with on-call consulting physicians available for questions and clarification
good,"Great environment to work, very good team work people try to help each other. I like the fact that the company always provide us with educational modules to upgrade us with our knowledge. Good customer service ."
good,I am a hard worker and sometimes it feels like they  we appreciate the ones that don’t work compared to the ones that do work.also I feel that the people that come to work always get  screwed for people calleing off.
good,CVS has learning opportunities for people starting in the field of retail sales. Promotional advancement is possible for qualified personnel and on-the-job training is provided.
good,"A typical day at work included answering patient questions and selling prescriptions. I learned the basics of medications and HIPAA regulations, including utilizing patient identifiers. At this particular location, the work environment was not very friendly and there was no push for work advancement, such as becoming certified."
good,"CVS provides computer technology and support to provide patients with optimal healthcare while helping them to save money  making their care more affordable.  "
good,large knowlege base to learn and keep current on. HIPAA privacy  requirements. Much phone time spent on hold. large company. free parking. on-site cafeteria
good,This was a part time position working as a pharmacy technician in a busy pharmacy. My fellow PHT's were great and on the whole the Pharmacist you worked with that shift was fine.  It was a super busy job at a retail pharmacy so it was exactly what it was. I would consider going back to CVS.  It was a good place to work.
good,worked 40 plus a week had good coworker to help with questions. 
good,"The hardest part of the job is being cursed out by patients when you're giving them the best available information you know. The most enjoyable part of the job is solving the issue of patients being able to get their medicine when someone told them , they couldn't."
good,"A typical day involved answering phone calls about qualifying for drugs for indigent patients throughout the United States.  I spoke with the doctor's office to determine the medication, dosage, and strength appropriate for the patient."
good,Enjoyed the job overall. It was a nice pace and usually had something to do at all times. The hours are decent and the pay is good for the job you do.
good,I loved working at CVS. My manager was very cool. Projects were fun and had plenty of help. My contract was extended for 3.5 week after the 4 months but then they had to cut all contractors loose.
good,"When I was hired, my privious pharmacy manager challeneged me and had good incentives to keep up numbers. The new manager is good now, but not my style as my perious one was. Its great if you can keep your availability free, but if you're in school, its harder to ger hours and pharmacy hours get cut back for months."
good,"A lot of standing, redundant and boredom was easy to accomplish. The staff was nice and managers was very nice this is the main reason for the positive review. Good if you would like to learn pharmacy."
good,"CVS was a very fast paced environment.  It was typically stressful as it seemed someone called in sick at least weekly, making it difficult to stay on top of scripts coming in.  And then the customers were not happy either.  Large turnover in help, constantly training."
good,"Although the work environment was very fast pace, the staff helped the overall work experience much more enjoyable. We all worked together as a team to get the job done."
good,"The job I had there was no set hours or days it time I had to come in.  It was as long as I got the job done everyday. Worked at different stores, sometimes as many as 7. Had absolutely free reign."
good,I really did like working here and the people were great. It's just too far of a drive for me to make. My hours were 9:30-6:30. Bad driving conditions in the winter. 2 hours standard winter drive time.
good,I choose to not leave any comments other than I enjoyed my time with CVS and I appreciate the opportunities I was provided.mnmnmnmnmkuugvhghghgusjiagdueiggbc
good,"CVS is a great place to work. Everyone is welcoming when your the newbie, and has tip and pointers to help you out if you need it. Great training program allows for you to learn and progress at your own speed."
good,It was a good company. Good hours and good pay. Like every job there was good days and bad. The customers were mostly great and understanding. Some were not but it wasn’t bad.
good,My activities involves working ion implementation and enhancement teams. In client enhancement teams we mostly work on enhancing a functionality to existing features like enhancing features of Prior authorizations like auto approval or auto deny. In implementation I worked on implementing new functionalities like Claims and rebates etc
good,"Good company to work for, but pay isn't that good. They did have advancement opportunities available, great way to interact with public and be able to actually help the customer in order to retain their constant business."
good,"I am thankful for the opportunities and training i received working for Cvs Pharmacy. It was a pleasant working environment, however I am seeking full-time employment."
good,Good place to work with opportunities to work from home.  Shift bids every year and overtime is available during peak season.  30 minutes lunches and a cafeteria is available if so desired.
good,"I have only been at CVS for a short time, however, in the time I have worked here, it has been great. A lot of it depends on the employees you have working for you as it is a retail store."
good,"productive and fun to work, good management, team work, updating the insurance information,received and accurately filled over 350 medications a day,and flexibility in scheduling."
good,"i worked for cvs as an intern but unfortunately when i expressed the fact that i wanted to further my career development by obtaining a residency program they cut all of my hours down to zero for the remainder of the year and pretty much forced me to quit after 4 1/2 years. other than that, it built a strong and firm foundation for me and retail pharmacy which helped greatly when i became a pharmacist and worked for Publix WHILE being a resident. so it all worked out."
good,My coworkers were excellent> We had a great system going. I was hired on with no experienced and they sent me to school to earn my license which was a great experience.
good,"a lot of work, we always had something to do which is good, friendly people, we would go in and go directly into your working area, the belt would start, areas are very secured"
good,"Promotes a path to better health by engaging customers to learn about their health and medications; educates customers about pharmacy services and products appropriately positioning CVS as a partner in customers’ path to better health. Effectively followed procedures processing patient medication orders. Delivered results while balancing quality and efficiency in all tasks. Maintaining accuracy while consistently meeting workflow and inventory management goals. Dispensed medication, filled prescription, typed and labeled medications, inventory, handled authorization requests, contacted doctors and insurance companies, customer service, and assisted pharmacy staff."
good,"A typical day would consist of coming into work and checking all the PA's, printing off labels that are in the que, data entry, fill prescriptions, process an order, return drugs to stock, and help customers."
good,"I enjoyed working here for the amount of time I was there. I wish the warehouse itself was more clean. It was very dusty and dirty. Also, the totes were always wet, which isn’t pleasant for the workers. It also gets very hot during the summer (85-100 degrees). The fans barely help. Goodluck!"
good,"CVS is a great place to work! Teamwork is essential and everyone pulls their weight! It feels more like a family then a job. "
good,Enjoyed it and enjoyed my experience there. People were friendly. Supervisors taught me what i needed to know as far as where to put certain items. Good place to work.
good,Overall Cvs is a good place of employment. You have flexable hours and I enjoy being a Pharmacy Technician. The only thing I dislike about this job is the immediate management is not fair when it comes to working hours and pay.
good,While working at CVS Caremark I learned how to perform many manager duties like counting cash registers and how to oversee other workers. I was taught how to handle different situations that come to be when overseeing multiple workers. All in all the job performed and the pay were not something I could see myself doing for longer than I did.
good,Good place to work. Decent benefits and management is willing to work around personal issues and conflicts. There's always room for improvement but they do try
good,"My review for the company is limited due to my contracting position.  We did not always get a full 40 hours due to not having enough for for contingent workers.  However, the management of the Pharmacy Advisor department is one of the best I've ever worked with."
good,"Employees are nice and most of them are foreigners."
good,"Working in Retail is hard but working in the pharmacy is sometimes even harder, but I definitely enjoyed my time at Cvs Pharmacy. The Pharmacy Mgr and Store manger was always available for what ever issues that I Had!"
good,I really enjoyed seeing my customers every day. I liked busy work and there wasnt much to do in the summer days. I randomly got two raises in a couple of weeks without being notified.
good,I always enjoyed going to work every day.  I found the work interesting and was always pleased with my fellow co workers.  I learned a lot from the pharmacists.
good,"Working in a retail pharmacy requires an ability to multitask as it gets very busy. Upper management could improve, as they often set up unreasonable goals or cause customer complaints with their demands but they are never in the line of fire. Their demands often times hinder the relationships we have with our patients because it makes them feel like they are more of a number than an actual patient. My colleagues make working a little easier, but I know that is not the case for all locations. The fact that this is such a large retailer with often times many locations in 1 district makes it a little easier for people who may be looking to work more hours if their store doesn't allow it. This is not always the desired way to gain hours as there is no more mileage pay for work travel. The training of new employees could also improve. Most of the training is on-the-job but even covering background and basic information of the field seems unsatisfactory. We've had many new employees who perform unsuccessfully because they feel that the training was inadequate and thus, they never stay with the job for longer than 6 months. Good training could boost employee confidence and team moral. The most enjoyable part is the relationships I've built with my colleagues as well as our patients. A lot of the customers don't care much about us and can make us feel like mere servants but there is a small percentage who are very thankful for our help and our information. The hardest part of this job is trying to keep up with corporate demands. This is especially hard during the flu months when things"
good,"Counselling and answering patients’ questions regarding OTC and prescription medications. Contacting with the Pharmacist due to patients prescriptions. Preparing compounding medications."
good,"Learned a lot about medical diagnoses and symptoms, but there was not much room for internal growth but the company did reimburse for licensure fees/costs"
good,"Filling prescriptions, answering phone calls, taking orders, leaving is the most enjoyable part, Workplace culture is nice, hardest part at times is reading the prescriptions"
good,The atmosphere at health in Orlando is good.  I made great connections and friendships.  The over all work environment was peaceful yet still very high pace
good,"Many opportunities for development exist across the various business entities.  My role in the PBM allows me to work across the organization and build many relationships with Sales, Finance, IT, and other operational areas.  The company has done much to align around a single corporate culture, but the various business units still operate independently in many ways."
good,"With the right team, everything goes well...with the right team.  Working collaboratively to do it well above being fast paced can be the difference between life and death and/or keeping drugs off the street.  Being trained in the store is the best way to go."
good,overnight pharmacist. Things were consistant day to day. knew expectations and was able to execute. Culture was good because worked mostly alone. Not sure if this holds true for daytime work.
good,They pay for your licenses and training however their is something to be said about the customers. They can be mean as honeybadgers and are very relentless.
good,"Decent place to work, all depends on the staff at each store. Very numbers driven. I'd work for CVS again but it gets to you after awhile, however I feel that's part of working in retail."
good,I enjoyed my time at CVS and I do miss working there from time to time. And I would like to possibly work there again. I liked the hours and the people I worked with. And I enjoyed working with the public and trying to assist the customers to the best of my ability.
good,"Job security, repetitive work. For good work and attendance you can receive coupons for the cafe. Management was mostly good, environment is like any typical call center."
good,The job was not bad but just want not for me. I found it boring doing the same thing all day. The pay was only so so. Cant really say why you would stay long term.
good,Company made a lot of improvements and advancements throughout the pharmacy during the period I was employed. Had a chance to be apart of a great company
good,"productive and fun workplace with tenis table and free lunch,short breaks."
good,"Very large company, with very matrixed divsions/departments.  Due to its size, change happens slowly.  Good people, and strong mission to help people on their path to better health."
good,"Lots of hours cut across the board, not enough to meet prescription filling demand and accommodate for all of the hired workers. When you combine that with customers that need their medication it can make for a stressful day."
good,if you aren’t  made for a fast paced and cut throat environment CVS is not for you. The environment can help anyone that want to learn how to adapt to any environment but not for all
good,Overall it was a very challenging but rewarding position. The staffing was adequate and  you had to make sure that all of your staff was properly trained and dialed in.
good,"When I worked at CVS I was studying to apply for a training position as a Lab Technician. My time at CVS has taught me that team work can lead to easier working conditions and to greater working focus. There was a lot of competition over maintaining customer relationships. This was the hardest part of the job. Conversely customer relations was also the most enjoyable part of the job. "
good,"Working in a pharmacy isn't as easy as you think it would be. Technicians play a lot of roles. Being a fast learned would benefit you a lot in this job, but either way it's not impossible to learn. Depending on the location of the store depends how busy it is. Management will work with you to get you in the right spot so that you are comfortable and happy with your job."
good,"It was alright to work at CVS. I learned how important medicine can be to the patients. My manager was sweet and sturdy at her job. My typical day was quite boring, to be honest, but I didn't hate it."
good,"Working with CVS has been enjoyable, throughout my career here i have learned many skills and mastered the job of pharmacy technician. Without CVS I would not be a certified pharmacy technician."
good,"On an average day I would run the day to day operations of the pharmacy, from handling inventory to assisting the pharmacists with their tasks. Helping patients with their medications. Calling doctors to retrieve information for the pharmacists. Worked on the pharmacy's schedule, and made sure every co-worker was kept up to date on the State Board of Pharmacies required monthly training. Also assisted other CVS/Pharmacy stores when required to help within the state. Kept other technicians focused and on task throughout the day. Solved problems and multi tasked when the store got busy."
good,the management are professional and know there jobs. the chance for advancement is there for those who want it. the con is the public if you are working as i was in the pharmacy.
good,Hours are horrible. Company allows you to grow. Managers are sometimes understanding. Schedules places two weeks in advance. They are always teaching you new things
good,Great place to work for. Easy job overall. Great benefits and discounts. work days are Monday through Friday. Overtime is available Monday - Saturday.
good,Filled many prescriptions daily and always kept busy tending to customers. Assisted customers with many medication questions. Leaned to work at a fast and efficient pace.
good,CVS has the big impact in my work development. I undergo a lot of training and helps me a lot to learn how to deal with different kinds of customer in any culture. My colleagues are very helpful to me since day 1 at CVS Pharmacy.
good,"the manager is the best at kaimuki, they are really flexible with my school schedule and give me time off whenever I need it. they appreciate my work and encourage personal growth"
good,"I was a pharmacy technician who worked part time. I enjoyed the job, we were all trained in all tasks so you didn't get bored. However, as you can imagine, customers get angry if their prescriptions are not correct or can't be filled. If you are sensitive or have a temper, this is not the place for you because you will spend much of your time being yelled at by customers. The pay is way too low for the amount of stress you deal with, and I can't imagine living independently off that job alone. My manager was great though and was very flexible with scheduling."
good,"You must enjoy a fast paced environment, multitasking and costumer service to work at CVS.  Supervisors were diligent, firm and helpful when needed.  Patience are very important for this job."
good,I worked with CVS Caremark pharmacy that owns several other companies. fast paced to the point many changes daily very little person to person contact
good,"While working at CVS, the staff was amazing, the management was some of the best I have ever had, and the environment was very relaxed. Working both in the Pharmacy and in the front store. I developed relationships with customers to the point that they know my schedule almost as well as I do. They know my car, and they know what I like to eat. I cannot recommend working with CVS more."
good,The staff was easy to work with.  I believe in teamwork and they provided.  I made friends in the position.  The Pharmacy Manager made sure is staff was well taken care of.
good,"Friendly teamwork is the best thing in CVS. People are nice and ready to help you. However, it is a little bit stressful during work hours, but you will get used to that"
good,The hardest part of the job......................................... all the test they give you. Some are wrong and there are no ways to correct them.
good,"A typical night includes, stocking, filling the store and cleaning. "
good,Company that cares about healthcare..on the cutting edge. Always busy in the industry seeking new and better ways to provide healthcare. CVS continually finds ways to change with the culture of the times.
good,Learned how to manage and direct. I used the skills from management from CVS in other career fields later on in life. Also good organizational skill by keeping the store clean and neat.
good,My immediate supervising pharmacist is beyond amazing. Some coworkers slack with their jobs so you end up picking their work up too. Other than a lack of education to patients from the DRs the patients were ok. If I wasnt finishing nursing school I would look into advancing and becoming certified.
good,"working at CVS pharmacy was very stressful but worthwhile. Being a pharmacy technician was a hassle but gave me the experience on how to work hands-on with the community, assist in insurance struggles for the elderly, and give back to the community with emergency necessities.  I felt like the employees were more of a family than a colleague."
good,Fast paced.expected to sell and set up patients which was difficult to do since you are busy selling setting up patients and being pulled in multiple directions.
good,"love the career I am in, CVS/pharmacy gave me a good experience and I learned a lot working here. I think  pay can be better for technicians because we do most of the work"
good,"I didn't work here very long so my critique may not be the most accurate.  However, my time working at this location was very pleasant and there was a true comradery within the pharmacy."
good,Best staff in the world . terrible pay for the amount of work a pharmacy tech has to do and the people they must deal with. Need to pay pharmacy these more. Makes no one want to work that hard unless you compensate them equally for the work they must put in
good,A typical day at CVS is making PCQ calls throughout the day and filling prescrtiptions and counseling patients. Management will help in the Pharmacy if they see it getting to busy or if someone is on the phone with a patient and there are more than 2 people waiting in line at the register. The hardest part of the job is juggling 3 different Pharmacist responsibilities and giving immunizations at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction that you get while helping patients understand and remember how to take their medications on a daily basis and the potential interactions that might occur while taking the medicine.
good,Working at CVS Health is a great working experience.  It has provided me the opportunity to work on the prescription side of the medical field and provide great customer care experience.
good,"fast paced stressful environment mostly because of customer which is expected, but my coworkers and laid back assistant managers definetly helped the day go by quicker."
good,"always on the move, handling situations from pharmacy to the front store fast paced, fun if you love a challenge, every day is a different situation never the same duties"
good,If you are looking for a part-time job than CVS is the place for employment. I liked working for CVS  and the benefits are okay. Management could be improved.
good,Enjoyed working at CVS Health professionally and personally. Attained my assigned goals yearly. Received many awards by seniors and fellow workers. I would recommend working there
good,"I loved my job at cvs. it was often stressful but team work overcame the stressful situations. The cvs I worked at was good at giving everyone a chance to learn every position within the pharmacy, so your advancement all depended on how motivated you were."
good,The best part about it is that there is so much to learn and you will never be bored. Managers are great and so are the customers. Just an overall great experience
good,"Even though I work in the pharmacy, I also a trained shift suprvisor and I work really odd hours. The location is 24 hours and I have a sporadically spread-ed out schedule. I am looking into getting more experience in both of my degrees and I am looking forward to a new change."
good,"CVS gives excellent training and support.  It is very hard to earn time off.  They do offer regular raises and overtime. After 6 months employment, you are eligible to work from home."
good,Being a CVS Pharmacy Tech requires a lot of patience and perseverance. I have been with the company for 5 years and the techs are at high demand. We do most everything and get stuck working long hours. Not everyone is meant to be a technician but it is a rewarding job helping your customers and making them feel better.
good,A fine company always finding new efficiencies.  Skill development is essential in order to perform the job effectively.  Team management is crucial and staffing can sometimes be an issue.
good,"Typical day is extremely busy. A lot of times you are running around like a crazy person. If someone calls in, the workload increases abundantly.  At times there are more tasks than there are people but if you have a full team the day goes by quickly and smoothly. There are rude patients at time, but you will typically have a pretty rewarding day."
good,"busy days, management adequate some favoritism, added work load from non productive coworkers, benefits.  monthly off-site team luncheons. immediate supervisor selective regarding availability depending on pecking order"
good,"I can't complain for the most part. A lot of my coworkers were awesome and we were always there for each other. Now when it came to advancing in the company, there had seemed to be a lot of favoritism. Not just in advancement but in general. Also the quality of the people they were  hiring had slipped through the cracks. When it comes to professionalism and being courteous is a must and I was amazed on how some of the representatives would talk to the patients and would literally get away with it. Overall, it was very stressful but some of my coworkers made it bearable and was able to manage to make it to work day in and day out."
good,"Working as a pharmacy tech at CVS was quite stressful sometimes because there are very minimal hours available, which means fewer techs to work throughout the day."
good,"Good pay depending on the hours you work.  You are by yourself and cold and flu season suck.  I wanted to learn and do more so after two and a half years of minor acute illness I moved onto a setting that allowed me to manage chronic conditions and work at the full ability of my scope of practice. "
good,It's more of a good job for kids in High school if you're a cashier or stock store shelves that wants to start out and get some real life experience under their belt. It's customer service so it can be difficult and it can go smoothly.
good,"The hardest part of the job was balancing all that needed to be"
good,As a multi unit Mgr we would be involved with all aspects of operations and would interact and many different levels both pharmacy and front store. The first priority is always our people and making sure they had the knowledge and tools to do the job but also to develop themselves.
good,"my typical day consist of checking people out, helping them find items and assisting. Also answering phone calls and concerns, stocking, passports,cleaning"
good,"It was a nice experience working in CVS as pharmacy tech trainee. I have gained good work experience and learnt new things. management is really great, work culture is also very cool, friendly staff and colleagues."
good,"I work in the pharmacy at CVS.  It can be very challenging, but definitely not boring.  You have an opportunity to meet and work with great people too"
good,I learned that you can't always depend on your team. The hardest part of the job was working 45 hours or more a week and being away from my family. The most enjoyable part of the job was my customers and the relationship I built with them.
good,We had three breaks which was a big plus. Its so faced paced and competitive that the days go by real smooth just how we like them. They have holiday parties that are warming.
good,"Fast paced pharmacy atmosphere, can be very stressful during flu season.  Area managment cut the staff hours making the extra work almost impossible during busy seasons."
good,"Quick pace, learned phone skills and shipping/deliveries. Management was good. Environment was great. Finishing work load was very enjoyable. Heavy work loads for one person."
good,"The fellow techs were hard to get along with, the pay was great, the job was hard to manage along with my college schedule. I put the job in front of schooling and I had to quit in order to continue my college education."
good,"This job is really depending on which pharmacy you work for - mine at first was SUPER relaxed and nice, with an insurance change it was way more stressful. The employees at my pharmacy were super nice, and we all got along without any issues and i made some close friends out of the 7 employees working there, but the other pharmacy (CVS) in town is a NIGHTMARE. they absolutely hate their job and coworkers. so it seems like a gamble."
good,I just counted pills all day and filled scripts. You begin to have relationships with the customers and becomes a family-type environment. Breaks were great because you can buy food from there.
good,Heavy work load supervisor was fair assisted if we needed help...offered overtime on a regular great learning experience. Meet a lot of energetic co-workers
good,Good place to work but salary is not very competitive with other warehouses pay. Usually 8hrs s day but there was occasionally done overtime .very mixed culture learned a lot about drug stores hardest part of job was making sure you kept everyone on task for shipping and getting orders out on the time they are to be out.
good,"I had a great experience working with CVS. The people I worked with were always very positive and hard working. I loved that it was also a fast pace environment. There were times when customers weren't the happiest but I always tried my best to listen, care, find a solution, and to keep a smile on my face. My overall experience as a pharmacy technician at CVS has helped me to further pursue my dream in becoming a nurse."
good,I have been learning more than I would've ever imagined. I realized that being a pharmacy technician is perfect for me while in school. I would've never imagined learning this much at CVS.
good,"Conducive environment"
good,You work well with coworkers and customers to provide a better environment and keep everyone happy. Keeping up with tasks and changing everything depending on the season.
good,"flexible hours, the pay is fair,  I will work usually evening, I learned may aspect of the way jobs get done, about different product, how to be a team player."
good,"CVS was a good company to work for. great discount, always hours available. always willing to pay overtime if needed. friendly environment. plenty of opportunities to grow within the company"
good,"A very progressive and expanding company in Pharmacy services. My responsibilities were in production due to my exceptional process control skills and years of home infusion experience. I work closely with management to improve and maintain continuity to meet the great demands of our infusion patients. Since I have worked in clinical, production and management roles, I have a better understanding of how to meet the needs of our patients in a timely matter without interruption of therapy. I mostly enjoy working with very competent technicians and pharmacists through teamwork and on going communication."
good,At this job management and communication skills are honed to a tee.  Stores can be fast paced and extremely customer service orientated. Would highly recommend this job for someone looking to learn and grow as a pharmacist and business owner.
good,I have enjoyed my 25 years with Omnicare and find it a good place to work. The benefits are good and the pay is average. They have developed better training over the years and I would recommend you check them out.
good,"A typical day begins with you being stationed in 3 stations such as drop off ,production and pickup in a 2.5 hr intervals .Being a tech has helped in many ways to improve my knowledge about medications , pharmacy management , also technical aspects of pharmacy.This is a type of job that often become very stressful but if you have the right tool to manage it it will be more enjoyable,"
good,"You will have a lot of bosses to report to due to the corporate structure. Managers are easy to get along with. If you can deal with corporate politics, wonderful company to work for."
good,I learned a lot but I was stuck in a store that trained other managers so it was difficult to get the time during the day to finish my training because of the focus required for the trainiees places there.
good,"As a retail store manager, a successful person must have control of the total oversight of the day to day operations.  Oversight must include the ability to delegate responsibilities to achieve optimal productivity and to get done all of the daily tasks required to provide a service to the customers."
good,This helped me a lot when I finished pharmacy school because it let me work at all stations of a pharmacy. The hours were short but it was only part time anyway. The pharmacists and techs were very nice and willing to teach.
good,CVS is a great place to work for someone who is interested in going into the pharmacy field. It is a very fast-paced working environment and takes some time to get used to but it is a great place to gain experience.
good,You work with refills and medicare daily also help with the members premium billing. Pretty fast paced. I worked under a different client but the mailed order was cvs caremark
good,"There was a productive routine that I enjoyed. I gave four stars instead of five for one reason. My issue is that I worked full time hours (40+) but was considered part time and got no benefits. It is company policy that only managerial staff are considered full time. I worked the hours, though. That makes me question the company's level of respect for their employees. I had a great manager, though. She was excellent. It was a great store and a great job."
good,"In a typical day at work you need to start with a plan. Theres a lot to do, and time management is a must. Scan outs in the store, restock,  review reports, merchandise, all while providing excellent customer service and assisting your cashier. It's almost always just one manager with one cashier. Multi-tasking in essential. Cvs offers good benefits, which does encourage other staff members to stay. The hardest part of the job is how corporate handles payroll for stores. Constantly cutting hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people on their path to better health. Customers come to my pharmacy because they need to for their health. Helping people find what they need and offering our support for anything we can is the B=best art of my job."
good,A typical day at work was face pace. I learned to stay focus. There is room for improvement for management. Workplace culture was good. The hardest part of the job was some of the work processes. the most enjoyable part of the job was providing customer service.
good,"CVS is a good place to work if you don't mind giving up your weekends.  Compensation is low, not much incentive for exceeding team goal but it's a job."
good,I beleive that because of my position this job was probably the most stressful I had in all my years of work.  I am not sure if in other companies Account Manager  are as stress as I was at CVS.  it may o even be a company issues just the position
good,"I enjoyed working as a pharmacy technician and it was a fast-paced work environment. There were goals I was able to set for myself during the day, and social interaction with the community"
good,A typical day at work is sitting at a computer for most of the eight hours entering data for clients. I learn to develop both speed and accuracy. Workplace culture can be considered family oriented. The hardest part of the job was leaving work at 1:30am.
good,"I loved the work I did at Cvs. While it was extremely busy and stressful most of the time, I did it with a smile. We filled prescriptions and ordered medications daily. Performed inventory reports"
good,"I would have to say that I got to work with fun but hard working people. Some of who have been there for 10 plus years, I've learned so many things about the company has grown to be, about how small the pharmacy was before it expanded. I started as an Order entry tech processing orders but moved to the medical records and float in depts I'm needed in. It has been a great experience!"
good,I'm a hard worker so the fast pace was a good job for me.  And the work schedule that they offered was perfect for my lifestyle Monday through Friday and weekends off.
good,A fast paced environment that will require your physical and mental sharpness. You have to be a good multitasker without compromising patient safety. I recommend CVS Health for a resilient pharmacist who loves working in retail pharmacy! Quality of life entirely depends  on the volume of the store you work at
good,"As a new graduate nurse I began my career with CVS Minute Clinic, it is truly a wonderful place to learn the ropes and transition from RN to NP. Treating common acute minor illness and providing preventative care in my community has been wonderful, and incredibly rewarding."
good,This company is a very face paced company. You have a quota you have to meet. When your departments runs out of work for you to pick you go to a different department and not really sure what that deparments picks are that makes it hard to keep your quota up.
good,"Love my job,  even though it can be demanding at times. The hours are sometimes not flexible  Our creates a family enviroment,  and a mutual concern for one another. Yet every workplace is not without its problems."
good,Assist customers with knowledge of products and services offered by CVS Health. Take product inventory faced and stock shelves to ensure product availability.
good,good place to work - but a sweat factory.....too many cuts and more and more work. Regulatory structure very severe. Too much paranoia about compliance and VULs
good,"I loved the pharmacists I worked with as well as the other pharmacy techs"
good,"CVS was an enjoyable place to work, but there was little advancement to make it a full-time career and the pay was low. Co-workers were cooperative and supportive, along with management."
good,"A typical day at work is done filling prescriptions for people, inputting prescriptions into the system and some inventory also required. I learned how to do these jobs and much more while completing my externship."
good,"Like many large companies that have grown by acquisition, there remain issues of consistency both in infrastructure and software but also in organization."
good,"Stocking shelves, helping customers was a typical day working at CVS. CVS is a fast paced job, must be able to multi task with cashier duties, stocking and assisting customers and addressing inventory."
good,"It's a good place.  My boss is great, fair and very knowledgeable about his job.  My department are good, fun and committed people.  I just want more in career development and pay."
good,"Duties were straightforward with any job description listed. Biggest selling point was how dedicated the management was to keeping morale up and building what they called the ""culture"" of the office.  Daily meetings for each department to go over any changes in AR standings and to acknowledge any and all employees who went above and beyond the goals each employee faces."
good,this company was an enjoyment to work for i always came to work with smiles on my co-workers faces management usually greeted you with a smile the customers were always friendly but then new management came in and things began to change for the worse
good,I was hired when I was 16.  I worked through school.  I trained to become a Pharmacy Technician.  I really enjoyed my job and the customers became like family over the years.  I moved so I left the company.  I worked there almost 13 years.
good,"Love the job, I am able to return and that is my plan.. Great teams!! Manager was so so. Supervisor was cool and helped as needed. Extra activities at work was fun and helped us work together better. Pace was fast but the consistent working on the same things were a little difficult at times"
good,"the colleagues are great and helpful people. we are like a family. the customers are nice if they arent having a bad day. they can be very nasty. the job can becomes stressful if not trained properly in each station. at times, people arent trained at each station and are left behind due to how busy the store gets."
good,cvs has a good working culture. they believe in the employee's feeling valued. they are very focused on service. they also have medical benefits and vacation time for part timers
good,"my work experience in cvs was great, i was in it for work experience and i wish i was hired on after but the main guy in charge sucked at his job and didnt even have workers to work there most of the time, tho at the store my managers were awsome all friendly and funny chill and cheer up always motivated you to do your best and work hard and it just felt like a great work place felt nice to come in to work"
good,Great fellow employees and management.  Hardest part of the job was keeping track of the different drugs. Most enjoyable part of the job was feeling like you helped out the community after every customer.
good,"Too many long hours at computer"
good,"Great place to start working, however the company seem to put business above anything else . The customer and the experience one will get from this place is great."
good,"In my time at CVS I have learned quite about about Specialty Pharmacy. Our department has gone through many changes and I have had the opportunity to work across many different aspects of the Specialty process.  I have been exposed to being an Account Manager, along with working with BV, the pharmacy directly, many different parts of Operations as well.  I feel with this experience I have a much better perspective of the process and what is needed to complete a referral."
good,"The Richmond Virginia branch of Coram is small but productive.  We all work well together and take very good care of our patients and each other.  With that being said, we have been set up as a ""hub and spoke model"" with another branch being our hub and this situation has really caused some issues.  There is a negative element to that model which is bringing down morale as well as our customer satisfaction numbers."
good,"schedules are based off performance, good benefits.  Upper management is always up in the air and replaced.  Long time employees are there one day and gone the next."
good,Great group of people to work with in a great environment and stellar leadership.  The store in Billings is an excellent opportunity to begin your pharmacy career with room for advancement and increased knowledge and training.
good,People you directly work with are great people. They work with you to make schedules work for family and work. Loved working directly with the Pharmacists.
good,"Good job, can be very fast paced, Requires you to think on your feet and multitask efficiently. On a typical day you are counting/ typing up prescriptions while answering phone calls and dealing with various healthcare offices."
good,Good working environment with great diversity of cultures.The management very open to input from overall QA team members on how to improved the over all work environment.
good,"CVS Caremark is a nice company to work for. There are several opportunities for advancement. The salary isn't the best but the culture is great, and so is the work life balance."
good,Fast paced work environment with people who are willing to train. A typical day depends on your position within the company.  There are usually enough tasks to easily fill up an 8 hour work day.
good,The day to day runnings are as one would assume at a retail business. The management runs a tight ship and keeps everybody on track with what needs to be done.
good,"Good company to work for, however, not enough hours given to interns. The system is efficient and easy to use. The company is focused of patient care and customer satisfaction. Training properly prepares you for the duties of the job. Ongoing learning is important with this company and keeps you informed on the company's policies."
good,"Typically I worked 28-36 hours a week, sometimes in the front and sometimes in the pharmacy."
good,Nice place to work if a full time hire. The building is nice and work is easy co workers are great team leads are nice but office politics are very bad.
good,"A day involves following the work assignment board where you are switched to different stations, mainly based off your performance. Answer phones, produce prescriptions, ring out customers at counter and drive-thru, access patients profiles, fill new prescriptions."
good,"Great employees and leadership all moved effectively throughout the busy days. The days flew by, but I found myself brain dead after long the long shifts"
good,Cvs was a starting job after receiving pharmacy tech license it's a great place to start. People were super nice and helpful manager was very lenient when I was attending school.
good,Secure job with decent benefits and vacation leave once you're established. Corporate micromanagement is a pest but this is consistent in all retail. Customer satisfaction proves CVS works for the customers.
good,nice people to work with...lot of work...customers were nice .. enjoyed working there.   had fun.  wish they appreciated the employees more and rewarded them for their hard work
good,I enjoyed my time working for omnicare I would recommend this job to many on the accounts that their a lot of overtime and the job is fairly easy on a day to day basis
good,"While i enjoyed working at CVS, management were not understanding of my hours and when i needed off. Scheduling went by senorarity so as new employer, I did not receive any input."
good,I love working with families. I love making families happy. Need to implement more structure for family unit to succeed not fail. I want more hands on with my passion for people.
good,"Meaningful job, helping patients. Otherwise, the work environment is fairly dry. The people working there are quite friendly but the job itself is under-payed."
good,"Have worked there for year and have seen good changes & bad. I feel that they are very customers service oriented but have decreased staffing, making it difficult to achieve the customer service that the employees want so much to provide, the customers deserve & the company expects."
good,The only negative thing i have to say is upper management tends to switch out often so those trying to climb the cooperate ladder slip thru the cracks often
good,would be great if should not require a certification for Pharmacy Tech would nice stay longer on this company.I would like to work with this company..
good,"There are so many thing that you can learn at cvs health how ever as a company who say thet take care of there employess they don't. I have worked with the company for overe 5 years an they have yet to give a pay raise or even a insentive to the amount of work that we do an dont get any appreciation from it "
good,"Like msot companies, Omnicare has its flaws, but all in all it was a solid place to start a carrer in pharmacy.  Management was fairly unbiased in adressing any issues that came up and as long as you worked hard you could do relatively well for yourself."
good,good people to work with and you can learn a lot of good information from the people that work there. good parking and for handicap your car is gated in for safety.
good,My review is confidential and private and I do not wish to provide any more solicitations nor paint the healthcare industry with any negative connotations.
good,The pharmacy is small with only 2 pharmacists and 5 techs. Pretty close knit. It gets hectic and extremely busy some days. Customers are not always the nicest but tolerable.
good,"The job atmosphere is somewhat fast at CVS, but is not without reward. Helping customers and making them happy is my goal and should be the goal of every team member"
good,"Best paying job ever, they are all about their numbers and making sure you are there don't like the new attendance policy but doesn't matter especially if you arent missing days or late overall easy job"
good,Manager was extremely understanding with real life situations. Calls were stressful at times. Training for the job was dragged out and wasn't informative enough. They do not explain the job you will be doing.
good,Not a hard job to do. The pay could be better. The computers need an upgrade & the management needs to better with communication. Merchandise delivery isn't bad but we could use more tools to help make it easier to do.
good,.If you like helping customers find what they need but also help improve theyre health then this is the place for you. As long as you put in the effort and work hard their is room to grow.
good,"take inbound calls"
good,"Busy work day, but good because it keeps you busy and time goes by a little faster. Great people to work with and nice schedule. management is great.."
good,I was a pharmacy technician here.  Work is fast-paced in the pharmacy depending on his busy your location is.  Must be energetic and have a good work ethic.
good,"the atmosphere is very hands off, front line managers have little authority. Everyone is nice. Great break facilities including healthy dining cafe. as a prescription benefit manager, your job boils down to relaying a pay or die message 10-15 times per day to very sick people which is incredibly hard to do."
good,I worked in the pharmacy as a technician. The workplace was great and the staff was very open and accepting of different personalities. The pharmacy had a drive thru which added a slight level of intricacy.
good,The job is very easy. If you work in a locations such as I did you deal with a moderate amount of people. Busy at sometimes but much less than a grocery store for example. Company seemed to care about what the employees thought. Benefits were so so before the ACA
good,Very fast paced office. Teamwork and great support from Team Leaders and Supervisors. Training program is very detailed and extensive. Giving you the knowledge and confidence needed to perform your duties as needed.
good,Good place to work but their compensation is lacking compared to similar companies. You have lots of growth potential. The company attempts to provide a work life balance. The company provides activities to keep the employ engaged.
good,"Enjoyed working there, place was very clean, customers were fantastic ,the management was great and fair. This particular store management encourage you to strive to be more encouraged you to learn new things and to better yourself"
good,Our pharmacy team is all very close and work well together. Conversations with technicians in other CVS pharmacies sounds like they are usually overwhelmed and CVS has unrealistic expectations.
good,Great people to work with but they don't pay you enough for the job that you do. Not enough hours. The hardest part of the job is doing everything by yourself because no one else cares.
good,Has an assistant they expected you to view all job with management. You were giving task that were impossible to meet on a daily basis. There was one cashier at all times so you're expected to be the cashier the stock person and the management of the pharmacy as well
good,"I grew to like CVS in the beginning. However, it slowly bled into my personal life. They ask you to give a lot of attention to detail. They sometimes do not see beyond the results. They want the results and that is it. It does not matter what you have to do to get there."
good,The work day is normally very slow but in the process you can get a lot of organizing done. I got to learn a lot of different skills and I got to meet a lot of different people.
good,Great corporation in a fantastic location. Good benefits and paid time off. The merge with CVS was an exciting opportunity for all involved. On site gym and bus pass provided
good,"Overall the jog is good. Very flexible and able to make your own hours, There are some long days and nights. Must be organized and able to say no. I did learn a lot with the company, and still working there."
good,Was hired in at 16 and worked all the way through highschool. Typical retail job but with a wide variety of opportunities to learn. Definitely would recommend applying if posssible.
good,"I work with great people every day and get to communicate with great customers. It is not too much of a high stress job, but busy so the work day can go by fast."
good,"I enjoyed working at CVS distribution center, although the hours were not great but the pay and raises were. The benefits were excellent but the expectations were sometimes extreme."
good,"very good environment to practice your clinical skills and very good communications with doctors and nurses make all patients life easier ,happier and healthier."
good,"CVS is a pretty good company to work for. You're usually quite busy so your day tends to go by quickly. The hardest thing obviously is dealing with the customers. They often have trouble understand why their prescription costs so much, or why their insurance won't cover the medication."
good,"I learned how to work as a team. My managers were supportive, the encourage me to be a better me. I learned how to manage  my time, especially when it came to helping out customers."
good,A good place to hone your skills as a pharmacy technician. A fast paced environment where everyone works as a team. Comparable pay and benefits. Supervisors that are eager to teach and help you grow.
good,CVS as a company is completely understaffed. The workload that is expected to be completed at the end of a day is too much for 1-2 technicians to complete. The only part that makes this job bearable are my amazing co-workers and pharmacy manager. They make you feel like an important part of the team and appreciated.
good,assist customers greet customers attend to check out a  nice professional enviornment to work in. a diversified multicultutal place. excellent for college students
good,Learning is always evolving. Healthcare is a dynamic state of learning. Work culture is good. I like everyone I work with a lot. Management is very supportive. Cvs even has a concept called Lifescope that is a free service to a liscened counselor 24/7 about anything like stress at work or situational anxiety. We work 12 hour shifts no but we do kinda a 2 day on 2 days off type of rotation going. The best part of my job is when a person brings in a prescription and it is correctly adjudicated and we save people as much money as possible without any pitfalls.
good,"At Coram specialty I loved the people I worked with. location was perfect but  the drive was to long for me."
good,CVS is a great place to work if a person is interested in pharmacy. I'm in pharmacy school and working here has taught me a lot of things that have helped me be prepared for school.
good,I learned a lot about healthcare in general. Working here made me love the healthcare field. I love helping customers and trying to make managing their health easier. The hardest part is the job can get overwhelming at times.
good,Working with CVS Health has helped me develop great communication and critical thinking skills. Teamwork is an essential part of working in a productive and effective pharmacy.
good,CVS is a a company I would recommend working for. They are very accommodating for those who are in school and working towards a degree. It is a place that does require dedication and a strong will.
good,CVS Caremark offers many career opportunities to the residence of Rhode.  I was fortunately to work for CVS for 10 years until my job was eliminated.
good,"CVS made me the pharmacist I am today."
good,"A typical day at work would be servicing customers.  I literally felt as if I was running laps around the pharmacy-- main duties included  entering prescriptions into the system, filling medications, and ringing up customers in store and drive-thru."
good,"CVS Health cares for its associates' health with resourceful tools to live a healthy and active life, including maternity programs. Growth in the CVS Health brand can take quite some time. Changing departments is the avenue to explore for company growth."
good,It was a good job. I got to work in the pharmacy and the front of the store. I received orders and I moved stock. The managers were nice. The only reason I left was to move out to Arizona.
good,"I worked with CVS Caremark, the PBM portion of CVS Health.  It is a good company to work for though it does often feel like the big company that it is.  There are a lot of advancement opportunities within the company and other health care companies seem to value the experience there.  "
good,"Productive and active work place with friendly co-workers. Each work day is different in both good ways and bad. I have learned that working with people on a daily basis can change your perspective as both a worker and customer. When days are difficult, other workers are open and understanding to helping you when you need it. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers, but helping a person when they are sick is the most enjoyable aspect of the job. Although my job as a technician is minor, helping people with their medicine is rewarding."
good,Innovative and creative thinking happening at CVSCaremark.  Lots of changes in direction over my tenure which made knowing what to focus on difficult at times.  Organizational changes happen frequently but team members do a great job going with the going with the flow.
good,"CVS is fun - My pharmacists are amazing. I really enjoy working there. Wow, this company is a really great one and I cannot wait to see where the experience takes me."
good,"as you move higher up the ladder, benefits and team engagement increases. decent, competitive salary, with opportunities to move up."
good,"Always have something to do. Staying busy for the most part. Friendly coworkers, good teaching skills, good experience, good benefits."
good,I really liked working with this team. They were great teachers. I learned so much working with this company. Lots of life skill were taught through this company that I can use to Advance my career.
good,Is too stressful. $15.00 a hr but you are working 2 different positions and you are working for all cvs specialty mail order and they all have there own way of doing things. They hired from with in to promote to be leaders and supervisor... Big mistake some of them cant be bother.. They care more about attendance and giving points... Is a.mess.......it has potential. They should be only a dispensing site.
good,on your feet for 8 up to 12 hours a day and the fellow employees are very nice and willing to help you out.. management and supervisors need to communicate more and more clear.
good,A typical day at CVS was primarily filled with stocking shelves and creating relationships with customers. Store management was always positive. Was a challenge moving up in the company unless you were with the company for 5+ years. Pay was average
good,Era cajera montaba mercancías montaba el shopper hacia pre-order había buena disciplina
good,It was stressful working in the pharmacy. The pay raise weren't very good but I loved the pharmacist's I worked with and the technicians. MedicL benefits were good. Its nbot easy moving up or switching stores.
good,"My typical day was managing client concerns in regards to there pharmacy benefits.  I learned about how to manage large clients benefits as well as priorities my work so that my work got completed in a timely manner.  I was able to work with my special teams to get work completed ahead of schedule.  "
good,I worked nights for 16 years on my week off i worked in about 50 different stores where ever I was needed. I love working and my customers were great most I knew by first name. There wasn't anything hard about the job and I enjoyed my customers very much. I filled on the adverage of 220 prescriptions per night. I worked days on my weeks off and again filled about 200 prescriptions per day. When I worked nights I only saw management maybe 10 times in 16 years
good,"My review of working at CVS pharmacy it can be very busy at times. When it's busy there at the pharmacy, it helps the time go by fast. I enjoy working with my coworkers they are very positive and uplifting."
good,A good place to work if you are a people's person and are empathetic to the patients and their conditions! The software and the processes are extremely easy and user friendly and makes your day smooth and easy!  I learned how to balance business and patient care and people management skills!
good,CVS has been a interesting place to work.  Lots of potential growth available.  Training and development is exceptional.
good,Everyday at work brings new adventures. The best part was interacting with customers and hearing about there daily lives. CVS has the right intentions to help serve the community but lack the ability to do so. They try to give a CARE approach to customers but without being able to staff the pharmacy with correct help it becomes hard to do so.
good,"it was a good job. production, read rx's. assist customers. enjoyed helping out people. i learned alot about pharmacy working there"
good,Cvs Pharmacy is fast paced job ensuring the satisfaction of our customers. We try to provide our best genuine care and make sure everyone that comes in leaves with a smile.
good,found everyone helpful and friendly . the daily work was straight forward and consistent.  very good work life balance that allowed people to stay joyful.
good,"Great friendships formed here. Great team building skills achieved in this job. Everyone works together to accomplish each job, and every roll is essential"
good,"Provide courteous customer service, Operated a cash register, Load and unload boxes from the truck to storage area Performed maintenance tasks such as sweeping and mopping"
good,"CVS was a great place to work, but it was not for me...  I was working for their helpdesk and not using my degree in the process.  I heard they are very good for advancement, but the job I was doing was not for me at all.  It was very repetitive and mind numbing and I need a job where I can learn something everyday and not do the same thing over and over."
good,Warehouse pharmacutical work in a closed environment. No windows  so air is forced with no fresh air. Fast paced but advancement opportunities are available. Micro-managed from corporate office.
good,"Cvs is a great place to work, the managers are the best you could ask for. The productivity never ends, and the relationships you make with your patients last a lifetime. Wouldn't be interested in another job if the pay was where it should be."
good,"A typical work day as a technician consists of assisting customers and pharmacist in any shape or form. I've gained a better understanding of customer satisfaction and teamwork in such a lively environment. I also learned how to work faster under pressure but still completing my task with the utmost accuracy. Management were always great to me and my coworkers; they were kind, understanding, and patient. My co-workers were also great to work with and I learned a lot about my job and duties from them. The hardest part of the job was remembering what specific medication was for and what they did. The most enjoyable part of the job would be a tie between being able to successfully help out a patient when they were struggling to attain a prescription and trying to make each one of my customers smile at least once before I was finished the transaction. I enjoyed making their experience as pain-free and easy as possible."
good,A typical day starts with a heavy load of work and then cools down by noon . It gets pretty busy again during rush hour which can be quite stressful. I learned that it is very important to move quick yet carefully to avoid any mistakes. Management is great and coworkers are nice as well.
good,Cvs is a great place to work and they have great benefits. There's a lot of opportunity to advance. It very easy to get time off when needed. The only problem I have is not going enough hours. I work with some great people.
good,"The job it self is rewarding but at the end of the day you find your self wondering what is right and wrong. otherwise, its a great company, just could use some evaluation for current job skills, so that every one is on the same page."
good,I learned a lot in the few months I worked at Cvs health. I was satisfied by how quickly they taught me how to use systems I have never worked with. Supervisors were really helpful. Only down side was communication from upper management.
good,"CVS/Pharmacy which what it was previously known by, CVS/Health is a pharmacy that's going in the right direction. Great job, good benefits, at least if you choose the best plan options. Undisturbed breaks, breaks scheduled into your actual schedule so there is no confusion between employees and management. Everything is so simplified."
good,"Beautiful coworkers. You learn here how to manage very difficult situations, how to deal with very rude clients, how to maintain calm with this situations. You have to think fast what is the next step when doing a task. There's no time to be slow, there's always something to do. The pharmacy manager is very smart and have many experience, you can learn a lot about him/her. The hardest part of the work is that you can't let patients wait a lot, and many times you have more than one task at the same time because of the lack of employees. I wish we could count with more coworkers because it's a lot of stress dealing with clients that can't wait, calling insurance for claims, answering the phone, making phone calls to patients who needs new prescriptions, etc. It's too much for only three or four technicians and it's not allowed any mistakes because we are working with something that someone is going to take.  I think that the company should be more flexible about having more full-time employees or at least allowing all the stations be filled."
good,"Exciting environment with great co-workers and immediate supervisors.  "
good,It is a very organized workplace. co-worker are productive and everyone knows his tasks. There is a lot of things to learn about medications and insurance. I really enjoyed working there.
good,"Stock store with needed supplies daily. As part of management team learn how to do payroll, complete schedule and order merchandise for store. Some workers would not show up for work and schedule had to be reworked. No set days off when you had young children. Learning new tasks and completing them on time."
good,Overall pretty good can bid on different jobs often people are usually nice and helpful.They give u a lot of training for the jobs u do.
good,"They care and do many activities to show how much they care about their colleagues."
good,I enjoy working at CVS store 8542 in Green Bay. My manager and co-workers are very friendly and caring. I enjoy being a shift supervisor and the colleagues I work with.
good,"refill and put in new scripts."
good,"Great place to work, not real challenging.  Great company vision and culture,  Very rewarding job helping people with chronic health conditions."
good,busy pretty much staff against the customers. Upper management not from the store will make you feel little and unimportant like you are always doing something wrong. To them compassion is an excuse and a way to avoid the poor performance.
good,"Easy work flow, have to deal with a lot of couponers. The hardest part of job is cashiers not showing up for their shift. Most enjoyable part is the customers, supervisors and management."
good,I really enjoyed working at CVS/Caremark from 2000-2005 whereas I transferred to the Lincoln facility.  My department handled all aspects of a mailroom.  We were also in charge of facilities management.  I sorted and distributed all the mail for the entire building. Processed all FedeX and UPS packages.  Delivered supplies to all employees.  Ordered supplies for the mailroom.  I liked the fact that I was able to move about the building on a daily basis and was not in one place all the time.  Unfortunately I was laid off in 2010
good,"I enjoy working there. It is a great place to work but I am looking to "
good,"Fast Pace Working Environment"
good,This is a fast pace job. It requires attention to detail and customer service skills. Flexible schedule is a must. Bilingual is a plus but not a requirement.
good,"Typical day assisting customers with filling scripts and dealing with insurance companies, "
good,"Rotation pharmacy intern"
good,"The management (at least lower management) was excellent, very positive, very kind and understanding. However, despite being a skilled worker (a pharmacy technician) and being promised a significant wage I was paid less than $10/hr. This is clearly low-balling what should be a relatively well compensated position."
good,CVS was a good place to work at. Can be very hectic at times but still managed to make it through the day. Customers were very rude at times and then you have the ones who were very polite and patient with what was going on with there medicines
good,fast paced environment. you must able to know what to do in stressful situations. must be able to multitask if you want to succeed to have a good shift
good,"Typical call center environment - with incoming volume of 40-60 calls per day. Internal ""customer"" contact only resulting in an over all pleasant atmosphere."
good,"it's fun everyday working with omnicare coz people around always smile, some does'nt but mostly does.  it's very rewarding when everyday you made someone smile and happy knowing they're satisfied with the sevice you provided and the impact you did with the company itself. i have a very reliable and approachable supervisor , she usually ask how you're doing and if everything's alright, i have another supervisor from the other dept. that i was working on who's always asking me everyday how many fax machines i need? he's a very nice person, but strict when it comes to work, when he say you have to send this fax machine to the nursing home today, well you have to do it. he always say that we can't let those nurses wait, because they too have things to do and accomplish. I would'nt have survived working with omnicare for 13 years if i don't love the company and the people i'm working with."
good,"Typical day to day functions here for a pharmacy technician are pretty standard. It requires data entry, customer service, maintaining inventory, filling and dispensing medication, and any other tasks the pharmacist deems necessary.  Management is very fair and motivating. One of the pharmacists actually taught me a lot about medication and how it worked. He would make games were he would name a drug and we would have to give him the generic or what class of drug it was. Afterward we got to quiz him and he mostly got all of them right. Even the obscure drugs were no match for him. After I left the company this particular pharmacist was the best man at my wedding. The company also paid for me to take the Pharmacy Technician National Certification Exam, After I passed they sent me to training to be the Inventory Specialist and then Lead Tech Training. I never had any problem with the people I worked with often times laughing with them at work and occasionally getting together after work, as a group, to eat and socialize. The hardest part of the job was that it occasionally got tedious at certain positions (e.g. dispense  window or drive thru). Overall it was a good job mainly due to the employees and customers."
good,"I whould come to work greet coworkers, customers and locate my boss to receive information on todays work assignment head to the cashier and began work."
good,good management unloading and merchandising built great relationships with my coworkers and managers the hardest part I would say was letting our customers use the bathroom and have too clean it 4 times a day
good,"Strong core business in pharmacy and pharmacy benefits. "
good,"Satisfy customers' experience, solve insurance claims, filled prescriptions, answered phone calls, perform the actives of a Inventory Specialist, Mulit-tasked many rolls within the pharmacy, and Assisted my Pharmacist and team members in anyway necessary."
good,"When I worked at Omnicare I did enjoy working with everyone and learning a lot of new things when it came to helping the patient I know that we never talked to the patient directly however when I would listen in on a call and the nurse would explain to the pharmacist what the issues were with the patient then the pharmacist would consult with the doctor to see if their would be any other means of treatment. I also learned a lot when it came to controlled medication with what is proper and improper on ordering, prescribing, etc. I think it was a good experience for me"
good,Growing company. Lots of experience in team handling and sales and marketing activities.Challenging roles ere assigned and achieved success.
good,"I loved working here, and I think you would as well. Great work to life balance, and the people really cared about each other."
good,"Liked working for CVS Pharmacy. But Pharmacist in charge favored another employee over myself. The other employee had been working their longer than myself, and could not understand, why I was given Lead Technician Position. It made it very difficult and uncomfortable to continue working for CVS Pharmacy."
good,"Great job to work at for new employees"
good,Stable work; good computerized sysytems. Good training for employees; opportunity to learn and improve job skills. Reasonable pay.
good,I think they are an ok place to work. Times have changed and they still haven't increased they're hourly pay. They give you a chance to move up in the company without being on the job for more than 3 years.
good,Job environment was pleasant. Most enjoyable part of the day was working as a team with the entire staff. The hardest part of the job was educating nursing home employees on the proper procedure for calling on call Pharmacists.
good,I was very excited when hired with the thought that after 12 weeks of training I would be running my own location. My training store is in need of help so my one on one training with the store manager (especially in the office) is not happening.  I spend all of my time filling in for cashier shifts and working freight to help get caught up.  The store manager typically works Monday-Friday. Although I complain nothing has happened to help correct this situation.  Others hired the same time as me are running their own stores.  The store manager was under pressure from the District Manager to sign off on modules that were passed due and even took them for me so that I could continue to work on something that was needed.  I was assigned a training manager that I have yet to meet.
good,"As an inbound call center representative, I helped process prior authorization requests. I worked closely with medical professionals in order to approve or decline clinical prior authorizations. The most difficult part of the job was not being able to fulfill every request. I enjoyed the call center environment very much, there was always someone to help me with any problem I had."
good,"I worked in a busy store which I like and my co-workers were awesome to work with. I like my managers because they were understanding and considerate of everyone.  Almost everyday it seems like I learn something new which was great; especially, if I go to another store to help out and they were having the same problem and can pass along the solution.  Overall the job was enjoyable and I never found the job to be hard."
good,Thoroughly review applications by handling inbound calls to determine their validity by using multiple systems and comparing them to account/application indicators
good,Excellent place to work. I enjoyed working around differebt people everyday. Great exercise for the job i was doing also.
good,Overall a decent part time position location but with little to no opportunity for advancement or full time benefits and compensation.
good,"Pharmaceutical Technician- (NH Board of Pharmacy Certification) # -PT9077."
good,I felt like CVS was a great place to work.  I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the patient population that I served.  Upper management was very personable and helpful.  The store I worked was extremely busy and at times became difficult to manage.  Overall I enjoyed my experience there.  I only left for advancement with Walgreens.
good,The job is demanding and the work flow is intense - the time flies by every day.  The people that work here are some of the hardest working people I have ever encountered..  Everyone strives to deliver accurate meds to the residents we serve in a timely manner.
good,My experience was that I start studding and they dint want to help me in my class schedule. I worked for the night shift and never give me the raise of payment they offer me for the change.
good,"Working with management changed at least five times during  employment and the organization continued to be  flexible with my schedule, which allowed me to  complete high school, attend college and complete my certification as a Medical Administrative assistance."
good,"I have been employed with CVS for many years. I enjoy working with the public very much. It has it's challenges,yet I still find it quite rewarding.I work under great Management,and have learned a lot over the years.The hardest part of this job is we are not always adequately staffed in order to have the best customer service,as well as completing tasks.What I do enjoy the most is daily interactions with the customer. Whether it is a regular customer or a random customer. Personally I tend to like the elderly shoppers the most. It feels good to be able to help them out. CVS is very customer oriented. I love that they set high standards to ensure customers needs are being met. Again, what I do not like is there is not enough staff to always live up to these expectations. Times have changed."
good,"You sit at a desk all day and answer phone calls about Federal Blue Cross Blue Shield members pharmacy benefits. If they want to know what a cost will be to them, or if there medication is rejecting at a pharmacy. Also when customer call asking about the program and how the different plans work."
good,"My co-workers and pharmacy manager have been nothing but supportive; and have helped me progress in this job. It has shown me how to interact with customers, insurance companies, and doctor's offices. Extremely busy and hectic work environment."
good,"CVS health has been a great corporation to work for. If it weren't for the low pay, I wouldn't be looking for a new job. I have been a technician there for over 4 years, and I am still making less than 11$ an hour, although I just got offered a lead tech position. I love my co-workers, but the pay is not worth my time."
good,"The job is not challenging and it tends to become pretty boring as less customers come in. Most of the day is spent on stocking/restocking merchandise when you are not on the cash register. It's a very repetitive job, which can be a pro and a con depending on your preference."
good,"The IT Field Tech position was demanding in that a large territory needed a lot of hands-on support. I learned a lot about LAN/WAN systems, PC workstation support, thermal printers, and more.  Management only became involved after certain large mergers brought in new people who assumed their way was 'the' way.  Co-workers were the people you provided support to, so they were always very appreciative and glad to see you. The hardest part of the job was dealing with new mergers, business purchases, and sudden 'high-level' policy changes. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably the sense of accomplishment when large projects were completed successfully."
good,Cashier.  Customers were friendly however management was poor.  I was required to stock and face items on the shelves.  Management was not helpful unfortunately however may be different in other locations.
good,"Job Work/Life Balance - Very Good"
good,A typical day at this job is answering calls and putting together packages. I learned how to type faster working here and also learned about the good benefits they offer. The hardest part is dealing with frustrated customers. Although I enjoyed helping them solve their problems.
good,As either a technician or a pharmacist you are on your feet all day. There is only 1 pharmacist to go around so if customers have medical questions at the register and the pharmacist is on the phone with insurance or doctors office then they have to wait. Customers blame the person in front of them for rise in co-pays and they feel blown off when you tell them they have to call their insurance about it. We submit the claim and the give us a co-pay. Co-workers make the job worth it overall.
good,I liked the people I worked with. There was a lot of changes and a lot of hours they expected us to work. It was very tiring and I didn't get a balance of work and family life.
good,I was a contractor.  Was treated as a perm. Employee.  The company has a strong work ethic and cares about it's customers.  I was in the logistics department.  Learned a lot and gained very important transferable skills.
good,A typical day at work is hectic and non stop. The management is encouraging and my co-workers work hard. The hardest part of the job is keeping up and a smile on your face especially when some customers have no sympathy or compassion.
good,"Clock in  count the safe check on current work load provide customer service. I've learned how to be come an effective listener."
good,Inputted and filled prescriptions. Answered any phone calls. Worked the register and drive thru. Assisted customers with any help. My co-workers were helpful with any questions I had. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers and insurance issues. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about all of the different medications.
good,"Work at Home with minimal supervision. Obtained excellent reviews on inbound calls and prior authorizations. Upon returning back to office environment, nice call center. Excellent cafeteria dining facility. Made to order food. Excellent banking services."
good,"CVS was an absolute wonderful place to work for! I enjoyed who I worked with and the job at hand (pharmacy technician). The only negative I feel is the Upper Level management. They are always concerned more about numbers than anything else. Also, CVS is always cutting hours. They think it's possible to do more and more with less staff."
good,The workplace at CVS/Pharmacy is really clean and well maintained. My coworkers were very pleasant to work with the pharmacists really took the time to help the patients and help the technicians with any questions they had. The hardest part of the job is being able to accommodate all customer's needs especially at our busiest hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers are really friendly  and they make you feel like a family because we all care about each other and make each other feel comfortable.
good,Working in retail you get to meet new people everyday and work with a variety of people. Every day is different. Enjoy my team and working along with them to achieve our goals.
good,During a typical day I would start at 7am and end at 5:30pm.  I would enter prescriptions into the system all day with two 15 minuet paid breaks and a 30 minuet unpaid lunch.  Once a week I would have a 15 minuet meeting with my manager to discuss the previous week.  All the manager there were good and let the employees work at their own pace.
good,I enjoyed the fast pace of CVS. Dealing with the public can be a challenge but CVS overall is a great place with great benefits.
good,"I enjoy working for CVS Pharmacy because it is a company dedicated to it's customer to help them maintain better health, however my goal is to work in hospital pharmacy."
good,CVS Health is an innovative Company to work for with great innovative ideas in the Prescription Benefits world. This Company has a very diverse enviroment.
good,"I was very pleased to be a part of this company. A typical day of work would usually involve working the drive through, data entry and filling prescriptions. I had some great coworkers and the pharmacy manager was phenomenal. I loved doing the data entry and filling the prescriptions. The hardest part of the job was trying to please difficult customers, but I always tried my hardest. I was trained on the job and I loved learning about pharmacy and the inner workings."
good,"40-70 calls daily. Potential training for Medicare Part D. Comfortable chairs, your very own cubicle. Business dress, possible monthly fee for wearing casual."
good,"My co-workers are extremely nice, I love where I work. I work all day helping patients with anything from the insurance rejecting the claim due to days supply or prior authorizations, and it makes me happy to help these people."
good,Very coperative management. Long hours just like any other retail chain. Good place to work for if one is game for the challenges in a retail.
good,"A typical day at work is when I come in and fill prescriptions or help customers."
good,"This was a challenging, but fun, job. Every day I interacted with customers and solved their problems. I liked the problem solving aspect of it quite a bit. Some issues people have are like a puzzle. You have to get each piece exactly right. Dealing with angry customers was distressing, of course, but I almost always had them leave happily because I was able to solve their problems."
good,"I worked in a team environment and independently. Even when working independently, I supported my team members, where ever I could."
good,You deal with many customers and insurances on a day to day basis. I've learned a lot of patience working here! Love working with people and my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people improve their health and feel better.
good,"Friendly and enjoyable coworkers"
good,Customer oriented business. Employees take pride in 100% customer satisfaction. Able to assist customers and help them locate products they are looking for. Self gratification when customers leave happy.
good,"A typical day at CVS included getting to work on time, punching in, and getting straight into the daily tasks which were stocking the shelves and keeping the workplace clean. The best part was answering the customers questions, guiding them, assisting and ensuring a satisfactory visit. I learned that there is always something to be done at work, how to work fast but efficiently and that customers are priority. I got close to my manager, Karla Mayweather and it was not the same when she was transferred to another CVS pharmacy store. My coworkers were also volunteers and it was an honor when I became team-lead. The hardest part was having to get something done quick with customers continuously asking for help, but in the end they always came first. The most enjoyable part was getting to know my coworkers and seeing customers return on a regular basis."
good,A typical day at work for me is a very busy day each and every day. I work very well with all co-workers. I would say the hardest part about my job is not knowing when I would get off. The best part about my job is knowing that I am productive and accurate.
good,"CVS is a pretty enjoyable company to work for. Typical tasks I had to handle on a daily basis were assisting costumers, keeping shelves stocked and conditioned, maintaining photo processing equipment, and taking passport photos. Most coworkers got along well and would work together to get tasks done. Management would be different depending on what region you were in and which specific CVS you worked for. Since I started working for CVS I have had four different managers, although I'm not entirely sure if this is common in other stores."
good,"I love the job and the people I work with I just want a job in my field,"
good,"The store I worked at is always receiving compliments about their customer service by their patients. Very desirable place to work, great support from coworkers with a positive attitude."
good,"I learned how to tack care of customers ,helping them for find out items, great them ,"
good,"Allowed me to learn and improve my skills as a pharmacy student by:"
good,"-Fast pace"
good,"They are a good company to work for if you wish to go into the medical field, particularly pharmacy. I would go in put away prescriptions that were sitting in the waiting baskets, check out customers at front register and drive thru, count pills, pull and put away medications, consult patients about over the counter products, and clean take out trash at the end of the night."
good,"My job at CVS Pharmacy requires that I have to multitask. I have a wide range on duties from receiving merchandise, being a cashier, provideng help to customers to doing the trash and cleaning the bathrooms. Because of the wide variety of task and low number of employees I've learn to maximize my skills on working with my pears and doing a lot of things at the same time."
good,"Working at CVS in Rowlett was a great experience for me because I worked with some really amazing people. Even though it was tough, busy, fast paced, and stressful at times, its fun when you have support from great coworkers and managers. Great team atmosphere. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the pace as a new employee and getting used to the different types of people that come to the pharmacy, eventually, though you'll learn to adapt with the retail environment and even have great conversations with some of the people that come regularly."
good,"For the industry, you're not going to find a better rate of pay. However, they do lack a decent bonus structure. Management wants to make things better for the employees, but I don't think they quite know how to do it and they lack leadership among their supervisors."
good,"checked in and out patients verified insurance collected copays did referrals, collected blood/urine samples  performed ekg  triaged patients and assisted provider  pre prep new patients charts updated patient information's scheduled and verified patient appointments"
good,It was a good job. I only left because was offered a higher paying job elsewhere.
good,"I worked for this company for approx. 4 years. Even though it was far from where I lived I enjoyed the work environment.  People are nice, helpful. They worked with my schedule when life events began to occur( kids and spouse career change).  Management available to teach new skills"
good,I learned really to keep my thoughts to myself until it effects me and keep away from the gossip and work. No employee is my friend after work on in work. People are crazy.
good,"I loved the guests, employee discount, and environment. The company work was easy and fast."
good,Working the in the AML Department I daily look at wire transfers to create Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) on customers who have passed the daily or monthly thresholds limits.
good,Met great people while doing important work. Work never stops so there was always something that needed to get done. I learned how to work quicker and efficiently to met the goals and daily needs of the company.
good,"Working in a pharmacy is a stressful, fast paced work environment that requires concentration and diligence. There isn’t much difference between each day, but my coworkers and immediate management are great workers and help ease the stress."
good,Learned a lot in a little bit of time. The training is great. I enjoyed the Job Culture more than anything.
good,"This job is incredibly stressful and keeps you going at a fast pace during your entire shift. It can become discouraging when you and your coworkers are doing your best to service your hundreds of customers daily, despite being allotted way less help than is necessary by the company. It is often hard to enjoy your job when customers become irate and blame you for mistakes of their own, their doctor's, or their insurance's, simply because you are the face that they see. However, it can be extremely rewarding, too. Working as such a close team, your coworkers can become some of your best friends. There are also customers who make the job extremely rewarding, because they recognize and appreciate the hard work that goes into ensuring their wellness."
good,fast paced pharmacy that is very competitive with other retail pharmacies around. i loved my co-workers there and management team.i loved that we had a rotating weekend schedule so that i only had to work 1 weekend a month
good,"A typical day involved taking anywhere between 80 to 100 calls a day personally, scanning through thousands of orders a day to be typed and filled. Not the best place to work for but not the worst either. The hardest part of the day was knowing if there would be enough staff that day to handle the workload."
good,Worked with Medicare patients to coordinate both medical and pharmaceutical benefits to best fit patient's needs.
good,"Get to work on time or receive a write up"
good,"A typical day at work is coming in and addressing what we call the Q . Which is scripts electronically sent in from the doctors office, it also has insurance rejections and doctors calls that need to be made"
good,"A typical day at work is taking care of the customer making sure their medications are filled on time and that they are happy. Quality over speed. I've learned that if your customers are content your job will be so much easier, and management and co-workers play a big part in that, because if your not working together as a team everything falls apart little by little. The hardest part of my job is keeping every customer pleased and happy.  I love making my customers happy and make sure they have a pleasant experience."
good,Summer Program - was the whole atmosphere but the two months of work was a great.
good,"I would say CVS Health is an average company to work for. The job culture and managers are, for the most part, amazing. However, they do not really offer competitive wages. Working for a fortune 12 company is great, but at the same time the employees are not always what matter most. I will say they are a fair company, everything is very black and white. With no gray area you don't wonder as much about anything being unclear."
good,I interacted with many people and the workers there were good people.
good,"A very laid back simple less complex version of working at a large retail grocery store. According to most of the time co-workers are great, friendly, and helpful. Was always a pleasure to work for stop-n-shop pharmacies."

good,"Arrive in the mornings and get computers set up and start going through the queue and fill prescriptions. I learned a lot about insurance companies and prior authorzations working here. not to mention drug names,generic names and what most of these drugs were used for. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of this job was the customers, the good and the bad ones. They all taught me something. The hardest part, at first, was memorizing or learning all the calculations and measurements for dispensing liquid drugs."
good,"This company has expanded it's client base in the employer retirement relationship for their employees with Medicare D, The advantages extend to the client on both cost saving coverage for the employer/client and enhanced benefits to the retiree themselves. "
good,"Good work place, enjoyed my time there. Left in order to continue my education"

good,great place to work. fast learning environment. hours were great had over time all year long.
good,I was only a volunteer while working for this company and I enjoyed every moment. I learned everything I needed to know and use once I became a Pharmacy Technician. I completed my hours as a Pharmacy Technician student to get my diploma and my license.
good,It was a good way for me to keep some extra cash and pay for the things I needed to while I was a full time student
good,"CVS Caremark has a very strong corporate culture and brand integrity. They operate very strongly toward their Vision, Mission and Values statements. "
good,Normally while at work the other workers was hard to work with because they wasn't very well workers and put everything on one person to do. I learned to let things go and just do as your are supposed to.
good,"A typical day, would make you lose track of time. Due to how busy it is and how much work is needed to be done. "
good,"A typical day at CVS goes as follows; first thing is to clear the cue, which is where all scripts called from physicians offices are parked. Then depending on what area I am assigned to for the day, which could be drop-off, drive-thru or counts is where I will be for most of the rest of the day. "
good,"prepare food, maintain a safe and clean work place, handle money, assist customers with there orders, train new employs."
good,"A typical day at CVS is basically an 8 hour shift involving nonstop moving , meeting new people everyday , and working in a friendly , hardworking facility."
good,Co-workers are just about themselves and the hardest part of the job is dealing with customers because most of them don't speak english.
good,Very challenging and rewarding position. Sharpened my excel skills immensively. Performing actual applied accounting knowledge and priciples of G.A.A.P and SOX controls while working in the role
good,Everyday I monitored calls. Management set a certain number of calls that had been completed each week. I learned how to summarize the content of the call and score it according to company standards. The management was great and easy to work with. My co-workers were very caring individuals who provided encouragement and work as team to achieve our department goals. The hardest part of the job was make sure that everyone was scoring was in agreement. The most enjoyable part of the job was after coaching a advocate hearing the improvement and progress that was made in their work.
good,Special place to work loved the work invironment alot it was like working with family.
good,"The insurance division is much less stress than the retail.  The hardest part was working weekends because, being a salaried employee, I was not paid for it."

good,"CVS takes pride in teaching their incoming technicians all they need to know to be successful pharmacy technicians. Mandatory courses are required that cover the basic rotations of a retail pharmacy - Pick-up, Production and Drop-off. Unfortunately, going to classes may not translate into being rotated at each station to gain real on the job experience."
good,I enjoy working here. Work is challenging which I like most.
good,Working from a home office was the most challenging part of my position at Omnicare. It afforded flexibility and made for long work days. I most enjoyed the interactions with all levels of management and staff both within Omnicare and in the nursing facilities visited on a monthly basis.
good,"A typical work day for me is pretty much routine and at times fast paced. Everyday at Omnicare I learn something new, things like new medications to hit the market, new plans and ideas to ensure the company's progress, and a lot of colleagues come from different ethnic backgrounds so everyday I get to learn about other cultures and different languages. We all get along very well. Management is very easy going and professional. I can honestly say anytime I needed information or additional help with anything they are always there to make sure I have what I need. I wouldn't say that there is a hard part of the job. At times work flow can be a little heavy but no assignment ever goes undone. The most enjoyable part of my job I would have to say are my fellow colleagues, they have great work ethic and some of the best personalities I have ever seen. I like the job in itself but being able to come to work and be around intellectual, pleasant, and motivated people just makes the work day even easier."
good,"Enjoyed my job. Day to day operations depend on the type of store you are at. Some stores require alot of physical work while others do not. This is a great job for people looking to move up into management fast. However, as with most retail companies, once you are up in management, politics take over the role of advancement. I would recommend it for a young person trying to start out."
good,"enjoy working there, made any new friends with the time i spend there"
good,"Specialized skill sets for each job title."
good,I loved the work environment. I am a people person. Fastpaced environment gives me a rust. I do get along with everyone I meet and build relationships with people.
good,"I worked at different stations depending my shift. I wasn't always filling prescriptions just as I wasn't always transcribing prescriptions or keeping them organized or up to date. I was also a cashier to distribute the prescriptions to the patients."
good,The co-workers are friendly and well train to be great employees.
good,"Good People"
good,"a typical day at work was meeting, work, break, work, lunch, work, break, work, home. it was the same things everyday, just wish they could somehow mix it up a bit by putting us on different floors every week. most of the co-workers were ok to work with, others were annoying or grumpy. but overall it was an ok job."
good,"A typical day working as a certified Pharmacy Technician consisted of filling hundred of prescription per day, assisting pharmacist, inventory, orders, and managed insurance claims. I have learned how to be diligent in my work and staying on task. I have also learned information about different types of drugs and dosing. I enjoyed my job very much."
good,"typical pharmacy clerk job. Data entry, customer service, and cashier."
good,"A typical day consisted of me checking out customers, stocking shelves, cleaning the store and filling photo orders. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who would get upset and say the sales prices were confusing."
good,"A typical day involves monitoring various sites, working with associates and supervisors.  Good team to work with if you have questions, there is a wide variety of knowledge. Good communication between teammates, including humor.  Best part of the job is helping solve problems and learning new things."
good,"The day in the life as a pharmacy technician is pretty interesting. My co workers and I would have some really good customers and some really bad ones. There will always be an issue with insurances so when I would have to call them, the customer on the other side of the pharmacy would start yelling because I couldn't get their prescription filled right away. Other than dealing with that, the pharmacy was over all a very good experience for me."
good,The pharmacy was always busy. The hardest part was not able to get your other job duties done because of the pharmacy being so busy.
good,A typical day at work consists of researching/updating and contacting insurance companies regarding claims.  What I learned here at CVS is time management and the ability to learn new systems and procedures in the pharmacy field.  Management has been approachable and enjoyable to work with.  My co-workers have made coming to work truly the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,"I would open the photo lab and store every morning. My day was filled with alot of cameras to develop, digital orders that needed to be processed, customers that needed help using the kiosks, and ringing out customers. I would also do price changes, planograms, boh, push, dsd the vendors in. Once a week we would take in the truck and unload all of the pallets and work the totes out on to the floor..while doing this i would still be responsible for my photo duties. I would also train any new employee in all aspects of the photo lab and show them how to deal with customers when under pressure. I would make sure all employees were certified in all modules that were needed. I would attend photo lab meeting once a month to ensure our triple sss score was up and that our customers got the service that we would expect to get if we were the customers. I always enjoyed the looks on peoples faces when the recieved their photos. This job had many stresses but also had many joys that will remain with me always."
good,"I love working with my employees, and the customers are great!"
good,"Great company to work for, very family oriented and helpful. Great company to advance with since they are a world wide company with the ability to transfer to either of there branches"
good,"This position allowed me to be a part of two different projects.  I assisted in writing the Project Charter for both projects which was new to me.  I also assisted with the initial Project Schedule, which was great.  Previously, I had not experienced this aspect of Project Management, so it provided me with a great experience while I was learning something new."
good,"Face paced work flow, very educational and somewhat stressful.  Management was wonderful, Benefits were excellent, and co-workers were pleasant."
good,"Great place to work for"
good,"Generally, most pharmacists work a 14 hour day. You are busy most of the time so the day goes quickly.  I definitely improved my customer service skills and how to talk to people. I also learned about the legal/regulatory items required to operate a pharmacy as well as how to run the pharmacy. Most pharmacy supervisors are okay but my last store had a poor one. He did not really know how to help and motivate people. Most of my coworkers were reasonably well trained but there is often unnecessary drama that goes with some of them. The hardest part of the job was being overloaded with more work than most pharmacists could handle. I put in a lot of long hours that went unrecognized. I was tired and burnt out.  I really enjoyed helping people with their medications and advising them."
good,"Very busy call center, Able to make sure that customers needs & concerns were taken care of in a timely manner"
good,"Worked for Omnicare Portland for 10 years and, yes, they are not a mom and pop operation and I can see where some people feel like a nameless, faceless number. I honestly think most problems stem from the local management and Portlands were amazing! "
good,"I was new to the workplace at this time. Met great managers and co-workers."
good,I was doing daily administration work and also lecturing students in office administration classes.  I learned to tolerate other people as we come from different background. It was an exciting and dynamic environment to work well where my abilities and strengths where utilized.  The hardest part of the job was when i had to stand infront of students for the first time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexi hours  that we worked.
good,CVS pharmacy was an enjoyable experience for me.  There was always something to do and even though it was part of the job they made sure to praise you for what you did.  The customers and employees always seemed happy to be there.
good,"High job security and company is expanding constantly!!!"
good,"Opened/ closed front store, balanced cash registers. Stocked warehouse and shelves. Employees were fun to work with. Management was tough yet productive and firm on expectations."

good,"I take high volume call center calls, the calls are assisting other peers in the compainy to help give them the correct informationto give back to the members. I take esculated call from other reps that the members are mad and need to get their matter resolve."
good,"CVS Pharmacy Bought Longs Drug Stores"
good,Good to work here.I work as a contractor at CVS from TCS at Rhode Island Woonsocket Location.I have been given opportunity to work here as Business Analyst and its a great opportunity to learn more about Retail Domain.
good,A typical work day includes processing prescriptions for customers. The Cvs I work at is located in an office building so most of our customers work in the building so we really focus on customer service. I also maintain all inventory in the pharmacy and over the counter items. I learn new things every day from drug recalls to training programs called learnet. The hardest part of the job is that this particular Cvs is inside an office building so we don't have the usual setup and its very upsetting to some customers. The most enjoyable part is helping the customers.
good,"Very good industry and pharmacy to work at."
good,"Every day would be a busy day. I would either be working in the front desk ringing out customers or on the sales floor assisting them with their needs. I learned how to multitask and conquer every obstacle as fast as possible with a smile. The hardest part of my job was being under staffed, so my co-workers and I were always on the move doing jobs that were meant for a team but only had me and 1 other worker on the floor. The most enjoyable part of my job were the customers that I got to know on a personal basis and my coworkers. They were the people that made my job fun and enjoyable. "

good,"i love helping people  no matter age or color "
good,"A typical day in the pharmacy was answering the phones, inputting prescription information, filling prescriptions, stocking shelves, helping customers in the store, and checking out customers. The work environment was a friendly one and everyone got along with each other. We worked as a team and if one person didn't know how to do something the others didn't mind showing how to do it. The hardest part was dealing with unruly customers, but if there was a situation we couldn't handle we would have the pharmacist/manager deal with it. The managers were friendly as well and there was a need for more help in the pharmacy or in the front of the store they would jump in and help on cash registers."
good,"Processed rejections for Medicare, Third Party, and Hospice."
good,This place is so busy and it's good because you can get a nice experience to work in the fast pace environment by keeping good internal relations which is really hard to find at so many other places. Overall a nice place to work. 
good,"My typical day was filling prescriptions and handling issues for the customers. I worked there for a long time so i got to know a vast majority of my customers. My pharmacists were always calm and collected making it a smooth pace. I learned about different medications, their side effects, the way they worked, etc. I eventually became a full time Technician. We had a small staff in the Pharmacy, it made us all a close group so it was fun and easy working with all of them. The hardest part of my job was being informed that a customer had passed away. I knew many who had passed on, especially because it was a neighborhood Pharmacy so i knew many from childhood. The staff i worked with was the most enjoyable part of my job for me."
good,"I performed basic maintenance and janitorial work. From scheduled monthly inspections to fire/security, egress and alert systems. I set up, and organized the warehouse and operated the forklift when needed. I was in charge of ordering supplies and inventory control.  "
good,enjoyed my internship there gained a lot of experience in the work force. excellent first job
good,"My overall experience with CVS varities, I started out working for Jewels/Osco drugs. Over the years was sold to three different companies, so my job opportunities and title changed a lot. The company is a good place to for anyone wanting fast pace. My co-workers were nice but again it changed when CVS Pharmacy took over Osco Drugs. The hardest part of my job was work load and trying to manage over 25 employee on different shifts. The most enjoyable part of my job was the employee, and the customers. I get to learn and know a lot of people through out the years. "
good,I learned everything through the CVS pharmacy program to become a valuble Pharmacy Technician.
good,Lately the hardest part of my job is just trying to get the job done. We are understaffed and that makes the job harder to do.

good,"Setting you the call list to call customers."

good,"I've been with the company for 5 years, and was able to advance, and learned A LOT! Appreciate the opportunities given to me. I had a good manager, and was able to realize my potential."
good,LTC pharmacy offers a great variety of individual jobs so there is never any monotony! Many skills required and used daily. Designated lunchtime provided.
good,This is a fine place to work but I find that I have to go in two hours early each day I'm scheduled to make the day flow through the morning hours. I am also going in on days off to help my partner. I am fortunate to have a partner that makes the same commitment. I am looking for a company that will help us address the issues that require us to dedicate so much of our time!
good,It was very interesting working in mail order pharmacy and with the different equipment.
good,"A productive, multitasking day with a customer service focus. Learning new techniques to work more efficiently everyday. Working in a good atmosphere filled with hard workers who care about their work."
good,Cvs is a good employer to work for. A typical day at work is a bit hectic at my location because we are in between to urgent care centers and a hospital so its constantly busy. My management team is ok and my most enjoyable part of work is seeing my customers smile because I made their experience a great one even though their not feeling well
good,"The pay is very poor and there is little room for increase in pay, as well as no bonus system. A very secure job."
good,Very productive and busy through out the day. Help the team and provide support on reimbursement and payer issues. Assigning and directing work through out the day and reply back to emails and provide support to all area branches.

good,A solid company with options to climb to top positions. Good working environment and team work.
good,I enjoy helping people find thier items. Many customers want to save money. I enjoy helping them save. The best part of the job is when someone smiles because they have saved money. The worst part is when someone complains because an item has tax. My co-workers are fine but I enjoy talking to the customers the most. They make my day and many of them are friendly.
good,Great place to work. Teamwork was always present.
good,"> Assists the Pharmacist in filling prescription items, as permitted"
good,Fun place to work.
good,"CVS on a typical day is slow but steady in the morning but by mid-morning/lunch time is has definitely picked up and you are constantly steady checking customers out and getting photo orders in and out. I definitely learned how to multitask with alot opf different things going on. For example there would be a customer or two at the photo kiosks working on oders, I'd have some films running through the machines and then a line of customers would just appear, the kiosk customers would have questions and the phone would be ringing off the hook and at times like this I learned you just have to take a deep breath, smile and call for some backup. Management/coworkers we all worked together towards the same goal, excellent customer service. We all generally worked together as a team to get stuff done. The hardest part of my job was having the coupon cutters come and spend a lot of time at checkout making sure you get every deal just right, other customers get agitated very easily when they have to sit at checkout for 20minutes while one person checks out, especially if no one else is able to come work a registar. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking and joking with the regular customers."
good,"If your looking into management, CVS is a great company to work for."
good,"It was an ok job, didn't have much hours available to work, they did not offer any 90 day evaluations for raises, and a raise could not be given unless you worked there over a year and then I believe it was only a 1% raise. Other than that it was ok."
good,"In a typical day I provide support for the pharmacist on duty by counting medications, contact customers with insurance claims problems and will contact the insurance company if needed, order inventory daily to keep enough medication on hand at all times, and maintain a clean work area. We deal with sick people daily who are in need of empathy and compassion, even if they just have a simple cold. We are expected to maintain a high level of patient privacy."
good,no comment at this time. ...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
good,i love working there. they just a need little more improvement but overall they are good company to work for. they have flexiable hours
good,"My position was very varied, researched COB denials & patient insurance payer changes follow up, billing corrent entity. Contacting patients to verify insurance coverage & other data requested on denials. Calling doctors for qualifying medical conditions re: equipment ordered."
good,"This was the best job ever!! thie was the longest i had ever been enployed for one company. It was Eagle Drugs Co, Inc. privately owned and operated by my previous boss whom I am currently still friends with, and if it wasn't for him and his father and their family, I don't know where I would be until this day. They had to make a really difficult decision due to the lost in family and Fiancial issues about their neighborhood Drug store, had been there for many years, they were selling the company to one of the retail stores in the area, but they were only going to sell to the retail that would promise to take on all of it's current employees with their current pay, and we would keep our full time hrs, and get full benefits, that's where CVS Pharmacy(Eckerd drugs) came in and grandfathers my years as an employee with my previous employee, which had made me an 11 year employee at the time, and they took me under their wings just like that, We became one big family. I love working where I can feel comfortable, and look forward to coming to work daily, knowing that when I walk in the office in the morning, I am going to see a face welcoming me with a smile and open arms."
good,"i would help fill prescriptions and label them, i learned were all the medication were located, the hardest part was having to be trained on so much at one time."
good,"Typical day includes answering and directing calls, sorting mail, scheduling students to attend Infusion Therapy classes, and assorted tasks as needed. I learned all my computer skills while at Omnicare simply by being given a task and figuring out how to accompish it. My co-workers and management were supportive and excited when I found a way to accomplish their request. The hardest part of the job was trying to please everyone all of the time...the most enjoyable part was when I DID please everyone. I enjoyed the scheduling the most...contacting students, preparing the handouts, creating Excel spreadsheet to keep track of each class and who was attending, preparing a database to track those who came and who did not. Management recognized my contribution and was usually accomodating when I needed specific equipment or supplies."
good,Caremark gave me the opportunity to grow as a Pharmacy Technician. They tought most of the areas of work.
good,"Wonderful job, would recommend everyone try working here at least once."
good,"On a typical workday at CVS, I would be the cashier and check out customers. I enjoyed the management team. The hardest part of the job was operating the photo lab equipment."
good,"Maintain registers, Assist customers"
good,"A typical day at CVS is mostly fast-paced with me multitasking helping customers, adding and rearranging stock, processing price changes, and checking inventory. I have been enhancing my ability to perform the tasks listed above. My store manager is a true leader because she everyday she is teaching me to do new things and listens when I have an idea or complaint. My co-workers are very nice and we have no problems working as a team or individually. The hardest part of the job would be when it is slow and I have to sometimes stand at the register for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning some of the things that only management knows. I'm gaining leadership tools that I can use in the future when I become a leader."
good,CVS is a great place to work. I have no complaints about the company policies or anything like that. However some of my Co-Workers could be a bit hard to deal with. Mangament is great I have learned a great deal from my manager including FSI etc.
good,great place to work with excelent management
good,"I started with data entry, dispensing medications and assisting customers. Later we had different projects like organizing, special orders, drive thru. I learned to prapare medication ready for the customer and patience for customers. I loved management and co-workers. The harderst part of the job was data entry but I enjoyed praparing medications."
good,"This company has an excellent RX computer program that is easy to master over time. The management always seems to do their best to help and befriend you. Their systems may not always be 100 percent accurate, but the employees always work hard and help each other out. I have never been treated so fairly at another company."
good,pretty steady workflow. I've learnt different types of medications and necessary precautions to take when handling certain types of drugs. co-workers were always willing to help whenever i would ask for help. The hardest part of the job would be when n i have to deal with unreasonable cusomers.
good,"It was fun going to work and talking to customers. I learned a great deal. All the Pharmacists are so nice, smart and funny. I enjoyed helping customers."
good,"I was stationed at the entrance to the office so that I would be the first person any walk-in would talk to. This employment period was just before the real estate/ housing crash happened and the office was very busy. With all the different job responsibilities that I was to do each day, my day just flew. The senior officer which managed the whole office as well as her escrow closings did not allow overtime in her office. So that meant you had to be proficient in all aspects of your job. I happen to be an employee which does very well in managing my time and executing my work efficiently. The highlight at the end of each month was on the last day of the month, the office would buy lunch for everyone. They would order in from any restaurant we decided on and bring in a feast. Everyone looked forward to that day. Great people to work for. Really enjoyed my time spent at this office. I was a temp hire looking for moving into being a permanent employee. But I was laid off because the real estate sales started slowing down drastically and they could not continue to compensate my salary when they had four other support staff in the office."
good,"I love working for CVS pharmacy, I've learned many different things that be very beneficial to my future career as a pharmacy technician. I communicate with many different people with a positive attitude."
good,"I assisted customers by reaching out to their doctors to renew their prescriptions. I learned to be an advocate for the customer, seeking to get results for them quickly depending on the situation. The management style was micromanaged which was not fun at times and it was hard getting used to it. However the most enjoyable part was helping people."
good,"The reason I enjoyed working for CVS pharmacy is because it felt like a family environment. Everyone co-existed together nicely. But the hardest part of the job sometimes could be dealing the customers. Ive learned through interning as well as working as a full-time employee of cvs in excellent customer service, good work ethic, precision, as well as make sure my customers had there prescription in a timely, yet, profession manner."
good,As far as working for cvs it was a nice job to have only thing i did not like was how i where being push to work harder and faster. Note that i did every thing that needed to be done it's just that my boss had his days of being a evil like i said before i gat all my work done at the same time i've broken my right leg and they use to push me to work harder and faster which i were and in did every day but any way i would love to work back at cvs. My co-workers were always nice and helpful
good,"A typical day at work involved researching bills and making sure the medical bill were being bill correctly. I leaned how to use knew systems and combine certain test that were run to coincide with excell. Creating a speadsheet of all the data i collected, and submitting for review. The hardest part of the job was the traing. Training was very limited.."
good,that job was reliable just didnt pay good enough for me and not enough hours cause i was in school at the time but it gave me good stocking experience and cashier experince for my first job
good,My typical day at work consist of handling escalated calls and assisting representatives with their phone calls.Noting members accounts about what we spoke about. I also make follow up phone calls to members about issue that I was working on for them. I also receive incoming and outgoing faxes as needed. Send and receive emails in outlook. I have learned alot about prescriptions benefits and how to be a good customer service representative. Mangement is very good. I get along well with co-workers. The hardest part of my job is having to tell someone that they will have to pay out of pocket for medication that is not covered under their benefits. My most enjoyable part about my job is when I am able to help someone get the medication they need that they thought they were not going to be able to get.
good,CVS/Caremark is a great place to work. I've learned so much regarding Medicare Part D processes and procedures. Management and co-workers have been very professional and helpful.
good,It was very nice and clean workplace and in Aug 09 they put in a cafeteria with hot lunches.
good,"This a excellent place to work, I learned a lot and was happy to be working with people face to face."
good,"Busy , Busy, Busy"
good,"Company as a whole is good, but not flexible if you have children"
good,"Pharmacy managers were professional, nice and flexible. I thought everything was neat and medications were easy to find. Pharmacy was well organized and other technicians were friendly, and knowledgeable. I enjoyed my internship here."
good,I have been with CVS longer than with any other company and for the most part I have enjoyed it. But recently my postion was made into a part-time position and I believe there are no prospects for advancement. I believe it's time to move on.
good,Depends what store you work for and the manager or district. Was better when I first started than it is now. Not too much stress on the front cashiers but management does have a lot. Not too caring about the employees as a company in my opinion after being here for 3 years.
good,I normally open the store and do opening chores and wait on customers   When my cashier comes in I am able to go out on the floor work on other jobs that need done.
good,CVS Health has allowed me the opportunity to continually develop as an employee and healthcare professional. They value customer service and employee satisfaction above all else and work hard ever day to develop high quality and affordable patient care to the community.
good,"CVS is a good job, coworkers are helpful to get tasks done. My store manager is considerate, and will work with you if you have any concerns. Hours are flexible as well."
good,Great work-life balance. I would recommend CVS Pharmacy. The pay isn't the best but the support from other employees and staff and the manager were great. I was able to add a lot to my skill-set and establish repeat customers.
good,"CVS sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise, including over-the-counter drugs, beauty products and cosmetics, film and photo finishing services, seasonal merchandise, greeting cards, and convenience foods through their CVS Pharmacy and Longs Drugs retail stores and online through CVS.com. It also provides healthcare services through its more than 1,100 MinuteClinic medical clinics as well as their Diabetes Care Centers. Most of these clinics are located within CVS stores"
good,CVS is a good company to start a career. You can learn and grow and study easily. Also the job is not too fast. But you need to learn everything which develop you.
good,I love being within the medical field. CVS Pharmacy is a great place to start a Pharmacy Technician career. They train you within the store so it doesn’t require schooling.
good,It is a good company with excellent culture. A lot of great projects people can learn with different departments and different people. Overall a good company to work with.
good,"A job where you can get a start in a career. Then advance to shift manager to assistant manager and later on to store manager, and regional manager if you are interested."
good,"It’s complicated. Sometimes hours so long and not enough credit goes out to those work to get everything done, understaffed. Working weekends is a must."
good,"Flexible with hours."
good,"A typical day at CVS was interactions with customers and making sure that the customer came first. I learned that communication is key. Both with co workers and customers. The workplace culture was generally fast paced at peak hours when it got very busy. Having to keep moving around, helping customers with what they need, having to continue the tasks you were given to do for the day and aiding both the front store and pharmacy if they needed back up. The hardest part was trying to find time to finish what needed to be done when both the front store and pharmacy needed back up when they were getting overwhelmed. I found building rapport with customers who became regulars very satisfying."
good,I would recommend others to work at CVS because they were a very kind and understanding company. I never had any problems working there. My boss always worked around my school schedule.
good,"I really liked working at CVS because I learned a lot and made good friends. In the end, it's only worth it if you stick it out and work for a long period of time due to the yearly raises. It also helps having a good staff to work with because this job entails a lot of group effort."
good,Get ready to stand all day with people constantly yelling at you. You need to work fast and quickly. Must be a people person otherwise you will hate it.
good,It’s a good job  It can be stressful due to the customers and the lack of people on hand to help but if you’re fast you can do it  it’s a great first job
good,Cvs is a family friendly company that provides a lot room for growth and achievement. The staff is friendly and the work load is shared equally and fairly.
good,I loved working with my coworkers at CVS. I try to visit when i can. It was hard work but it felt fulfilling (at least at the location i worked at). The only reason i left was because i wasn't making enough and i didn't see myself as a store manager.
good,This includes stocking up each shelf for items that are missing and providing assistance to customers as to where each product is or the product they want.
good,"Very busy store without full staff where will help u to learn how to multi task. Get to help elderly sick patient, infants.You are the middle man between the doctor and insurance on trying to get the patient there medicine."
good,Take call of our member and help them find the answers on how their plan works for them and advise if they need to have Prior Authorizations for some meds. Also explain to them what we need to try to get medication covered and what the cost of the med would be.
good,"Work is flexible with college schedule, it is productive focuses on customer service. it is a family environment and gives opportunity to move up. It has good hours."
good,"So far so good. I have flexibility to do with my time what I need to do , and there are also times when it is call after call. That variety helps. Many of huge projects, many opportunities to learn."
good,I enjoyed every minute and learned a lot while working there. The managers were very friendly and understanded. They help me cultivate my experience and was very helpful.
good,I learned how to interact with all kinds of people. This job truly made me a better person and helped me get a better understanding of how to communicate with people.
good,"CVS is a company I enjoy working for. There have been great opportunities for growth, training, and advancement. The customers become family and makes doing the job even more of an accomplishment."
good,". I do all that is asked of me without question and I am very attentive and learn new tasks given to me quickly.  I work at a very fast pace, I provide excellent service, professionalism and resolve problems with disgruntled inmates so the situation does not escalate. I will do all I can, to ensure that I remain one of the absolute best of the employees chosen. I promise if hired, I will do all to the best of my ability and will not falter under stress."
good,The benefits of working here are they are willing to work with you when it comes to giving more hours. The pay was good and the workplace was very easy to work in as well. Everyone was respectful and when I needed help with something they were willing to help me.
good,their was a line out side the door and around the back to become an upper level manager. This made work very competitive and very cut throat. You had to really work to be noticed.
good,"Typical work day would be slow, I learned retail experience and customer service the hardest part of my job was ensuring customer satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of my job was stocking and labeling merchandise."
good,We worked as a group. We were helping each other when it comes to work. I can say I had a great time working there at CVS because the experience was excellent with them.
good,Busy work environment without enough payroll. Unrealistic goals set that you cannot reach. Good benefits and pay. Learned a great deal about how to manage a staff
good,I definitely was excited about learning another aspect of pharmacy.  Understanding patient care is top priority & working with others to provide that care is very fulfilling.
good,While interning at in Target I was always encouraged to do my best and learned something new everyday. My supervisor gave me tips and helped me learn all the possible skills in a pharmacy.
good,"The entire time I worked there I had no problem with anyone, everyone was respectful and there were no issues. If there was a problem the pharmacy manager was there to help."
good,cvs is a great place to work with the right team behind you. They care about their patients and do everything in their power to ensure the customers are happy.
good,Cvs gave me the opportunity to grow into a management positions due to my work ethic and attentiveness. I would recommend anyone starting out into the work force to consider cvs.
good,Productive work place. Adjust schedule according to employee availability. Meeting different people everyday and enjoy work helping people to shop . Give them a nice shopping experience .
good,"A purpose-driven company with talented, driven professionals helping people on their path to better health.  Great CEO and solid leadership team.  Strong focus on diversity."
good,"I enjoyed work at CVS and would go back. My managers were a pleasure to work for and with."
good,I enjoyed my time working for CVS as a Pharmacy Technician. The work culture is great with diversity. The only aspect of the position I would change is training of the Pharmacy Technician. I feel it should be more detailed as in internship.
good,Management at CVS at the location I was at was wonderful they work with you are there to help you when you need them and they're wonderful about assisting customers that needed help
good,The happiest part of my job was answering the phones and executing the members happiness. I go above and beyond to make sure the members are happy and are able to get their medications.
good,A great place to work! It always brings excitement knowing that I have an impact on patient lives through excellent customer service and consultations!
good,"Cvs pharmacy really cares about the customers and their employees. It is very easy to be moved up within the company and they offer a lot of great benefits such as 401k, dental insurance, and health insurance."
good,I like working at CVS because it has great staff of employees who are working hard every day to make sure that everything is taking care. I will like to see someone if upper level to come visit our store and see how people are doing their best to get their job done well .
good,"Autonomous work, with collaboration just a phone call away. Great opportunity for growth in many ways. You also are expected to take on an administrative role as well as a clinical role - growing experience."
good,I gained a lot of experience since this will be my field. I learned how to handle healthcare and how to deal with patients. What to do when i face a problem.
good,CVS goes above and beyond for their customers. CVS Takes care of their employees with multiple shifts and job titles.  Management wants to have all employees do well on all levels.
good,"A great place to get your foot into the Pharmacy world. They pay for your license, there is a path to move up. You can get a lot of knowledge for your everyday life and future just by working there"
good,"I would suggest working here. Probably the best company I've worked for in years. I've been looking for something similar, but cant found the right company. They treat you good, and give you good pay."
good,"CVS Health was a decent company to work for. My issue was too much big business, and too little attention to actual issues for the members. I don't believe anything I brought up will ever be addressed by management."
good,A lot of work if you want it . I just like the company The schedule was flexible as a part time staff pharmacist. At the time I picked and choose the location I wanted.
good,"Company gives you chance to grow and advance to the top, with the right manager... "
good,"Absolutely loved my PIC and fellow technicians, we were truly a family there. I know I'm lucky because not many stores have that. The only thing I can say is if CVS gave its technicians more hours, more work would get done. Because on some days working there, I felt extremely overwhelmed, especially if it was just me and a floater (a pharmacist that's on call) having to back her up, do my work, help out customers and contact physicians, I felt like walking out, but I didn't of course, what am I a monster. Other than that great place to start off at, teaches you how you'll handle working in a fast-paced, high stressed environment"
good,"We have pretty good morale and good management. Pay is lower than some places. People don't gossip about each other. Most people work on reports and task lists with billing, accounts receivable and cash receipts- few are on the phones."
good,I enjoyed my time with CVS/Pharmacy. I had multiple different experiences with different stores and some came have a bad reputation but most stores are very well organized.
good,Working at CVS is very rewarding.I love working with my colleagues as well as the community that shops and utilizes the pharmacy I been there for 14 years now so obviously happy with the company.
good,It was fun to work there and i learned a lot in my time there. I made new friends and i was able to learn new skills that will help me in my future jobs and applications.
good,I'm honored to work with that company more importantly where I was employed i love the staff and managers they were fam through the years I stayed. Our work day was enjoyable and fun no day really seemed hard because we all looked out for each other.
good,I love my job I love the people I worked with I loved my customers. Unfortunately I had to take a leave of absence from my job and when I went to return to my job my boss had given away my shift and my position if I could go back I would love to go back as I said I love my job and I miss it.
good,The job was very fun and educational taught me a lot of skills that i can use in future jobs. Made me a much brighter professional leader that i have ever been
good,"at cvs the environment was very quiet and slow paced. customers  are usually friendly. the worst thing about the job is getting paid bi- weekly. the best thing about the job, it is stress free."
good,"worked denials, spreadsheets,submitting corrected claims.  hardest part is  payers understanding contracts and the most enjoyable is being recognized for the projects that have been completed"
good,Great work environment mandatory overtime is tough if you have children or other things to do. Hard to work around family or children. Also this company does not accept doctors notes. If it is not severe enough to take a leave you will get an occurrence.
good,being at CVS made me feel apart of something great i was able to learn under an great pharmacist and  peers where we work together to make the job easy going and fast past.
good,"Most of the time working a 8 hour shift, the time went fast because I was always busy. The people that I worked with were very friendly, and they always cared about their coworkers."
good,I have been with this company over 4 years. I enjoy working for this company. The benefits are awesome. We provide customer service via phone. Each technician has their own desk and phone to work from. We provide pharmacy services to long term care facilities and assisted living facilities. Orders are entered and medications are sent to the facilities.
good,On the job training for school for 200 hours to complete. Teaching where all the drugs are in order and remember the location. DiDispensing medication
good,"Learning new things, working with considerate people, relaxed atmosphere, describes the work environment at this particular CVS   "
good,"Some days are a lot crazier than others that is for sure. Overall, I do enjoy working with my coworkers. But I can say that you should be prepared to be on your feet all day."
good,"I like it here. I am happy and enjoying my work. Learning really does not stop. New things in new places, and CVS is a company who wants continuous improvement in all aspect."
good,The training class was fun but when we got on to the call center floor it was during the busy season. That’s when the calls got stressful. Management was nice and they provided food and snacks often.
good,Almost everyone starts out picking orders. But there is opportunities to move to other areas in the warehouse. Reviews and raises are fair. Multiple shifts available.
good,workday consisted of being on the phones and taking calls. phones are not allowed to be out while in the call center. strict with lunch and breaks. expected to work at least one weekend day.
good,"I really much interest to work there and attend conference calls , meeting and collaborative with team members to complete my task  which would be great part to achieve goal in my carrier.I love the work culture ."
good,"This company has made it so comfortable for people who are 15 and older to enjoy working at a store with multiple customers treating you like garbage. This company cares about people smoking cigarettes, people getting the best benefits, and also getting paid really well! I would recommend this to anyone as a first time job, and as a full-time job with room to advance to a supervisor!"
good,"CVS was always my go-to job throughout the years. They always paid me well and I did learn a lot. They train you themselves, and most managers I encountered were pretty good. If you start off working there young, you most definitely have a better chance of advancement."
good,Good manager and co-workers. Fast paced. Hardest part of the job is standing on your feet for hours. Better like working with the public; they can be very demanding.
good,CVS Health is a great place to work for any aspiring professionals from Business unit. The company's mission very much aligns and is broadcasted to individual colleagues across the company.
good,"Good job, flexible hours, worked with your schedule, nice staff, liked the people I worked with, good customers, busy work environment, good work environment"
good,It’s a good company to work for. They are always willing to accommodate the employees needs and also flexible schedule is important too. Great great company
good,I feel that I'm underpaid for my position. I am a shift supervisor and a pharmacy technician. The company made a lot of hour cut backs and it has affected the ability to get everything done that needs to be done each day.
good,it was a great place to work for when i first started working and i enjoyed my coworkers and most of my customers it is a retail job so you need a semi thick skin though
good,"Worked at CVS through my school i worked there for a few months, I liked the work ,it gave me stocking experience I needed, cleaning, stocking shelves"
good,CVS treats their employees fairly. It can be a stressful job but they always seem to have plenty of help. Customer service is a very high priority for the company.
good,"Although many contractors I work with have converted to employees, I have not been offered for conversion.  I am told that you need to stand out to be noticed in order to convert."
good,Treated like an important part of the team. Provided with appropriate amount of training to be successful. Many great customers. A lot of work but fun group of people!
good,Good place to work. I was promoted from cashier to shift supervisor within 6 months of working here but it seems as though there are more than several employees that won’t advance higher than the shift supervisor position. I was never really trained so everything I learned was through trial and error or asking around.
good,A typical day was greeting customers and stocking shelves. The most enjoyable part was having conversations with customers because they always had something interesting to say
good,"This was by far my favorite pharmacy to work at. The environment behind the counter was very fluid. We all knew where we should be, what we should do, without asking questions. I unfortunately had a health issue and needed time off which did not work with their schedule understandably."
good,"As a split case picker you had to maintain a constant speed when picking the orders.  If your speed is not above their computer generated speed of 95% management will speak to you about how to bring your speed up, also threatening you to be let go.  The day was constant scanning an order into their computer and walking the line picking--computer clicking away the time until you scan your next order into the computer. This is all the day consists of-scanning, picking--and also fighting to get merchandise off the racks to pick sometimes."
good,"promotes from within, great training programs. vacation and sick time. benifits include discounts out car insurance and cell phone bills. puts health above all else"
good,"CVS was a great place to work as I began my new career journey. I honestly would probably yet be working for the company if I was able to pass my board exam. Overall, CVS is a great place to work."
good,My coworkers and our store manager made it an amazing experience.   I truly enjoyed my time there.   I would go back in a minute.   Fast-paced but still loads of fun
good,cvs is a good company to work for with little draw backs minus the lp people being super shady when it comes to letting people go. they tend to accuse you of stuff but then tell you they'll follow up with you about it after your are fired they never let you know anything.  thats after they say you owe them over 500 dollarS
good,Cvs is an learning and development company its like running your own company. I enjoy the atmosphere that I work with the customers are like family. Great place to work for.
good,Customer service is key! You have to be willing to work will all people! Being a people person and knowing how to handle people is big. There is big need for professionalism
good,Rewarding workplace with opportunities for career growth.  CVS Health is re-inventing healthcare and making it more simple for our patients and customers.
good,"Was a fine place to work, in the beginning. Benefits were more rewarding before hours were cut. Paying for required benefits on 'Full-time' status while working less than 35 hours a week is a little disappointing. Not to mention a little difficult. Not as rewarding as it was before hours were cut. Being understaffed results in a stressful work day! Lack of available work hours results in tired, stressed employees...with the usual increase in demand of added tasks. Holiday pay is good...you do, however, meet some 'not so understanding' customers working retail."
good,"Very busy working environment that can be stressful, whether in front store or pharmacy. If you work full-time, you gain a lot of benefits from the company. The one thing I had an issue with is that as a female, I ran into some inappropriate issues with a multitude of customers, and unfortunately CVS did nothing to help make my work environment more comfortable and safe."
good,"Request payments to obtain Business licenses, as soon I have the licenses I mail them to the stores.Budget all the money I expend all month. Solve problems during the day."
good,"The CVS system was user-friendly, and the pharmacy layout allows for plenty of patient interaction. The patient population I worked with ranged from travelers to the lower socioeconomic status population."
good,Working for CVS Caremark was a very good experience. There is a position for everyone that will fit their skill sets and provide a good working environment in the store.  The training is very thorough and quality and attention to detail is very important.
good,"I was the cashier so I was standing on my feet all day, greeting customers, helping them with their needs, being friendly, was putting back the returns where they belong."
good,Fast paced environment with a lot of patient contact throughout the day which is my favorite part about the job. Management is very professional and work culture is diverse.
good,Working at Cvs was a wonderful experience I really enojoyed working with the public. I loved meeting and gretting new people. A typical work day at Cvs was coming in clocking in and starting to greet the people as they entered the store. I lerned how to have patience with the customer that can be diffucult at times. The management was very professional. There really wasn't a hard part about the job.The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting and greeting the customers.
good,There is always work to do and never a dull moment when working in customer service. Your day is always customer focused and ensuring everyone is finding everything they need with ease.
good,"Great growing company, rules change often which is annoying and not alot of support is given all of the time however thats bias based on which location you work at."
good,Handle a lot of prescriptions and customers. be able to multitask because it's difficult to complete anything if you focus on one thing like ringing up just customers.
good,My managers were very helpful and had no issues training me to do new things. I continued in my knowledge of proper HIPPA requirements. I also got to further my customer service experience there.
good,"Overall CVS is a good employer. Seems to have a stable foothold in the market, with focus turning toward healthcare. There are many changes coming to the stores from Corporate, so leadership skills are valuable to the manager. Good benefits and pay. Managers are required to work 45 hr per week, minimum. Every other weekend off is nice, especially in retail."
good,You will gain good experience at CVS and will learn a lot about a very nibble fast pace company. Work life balance is good for those with families. Very understanding if you have a sick child.
good,Training is virtual which is terrible. Lunch is overpriced and only one food truck on Fridays. They don’t have great hours and the pay is not minimum for pt they are paid the same as customer service representative only thing they have is great is paid time off is given after 90 days and have a amount of 125 hours
good,I actually really liked working at CVS. Would gladly go back if I could get the hours I need to coincide with my family needs.  I think this job would be perfect for someone who has no scheduling conflicts and is open to being available whenever needed.
good,"All employees worked together very well, it was busy most of the time.  If not busy with customers we all had to stock shelves which was okay because gave you a chance to get away from the cash register."
good,"Great company to work for.      Have no other comment to say. Great company benefits and health insurance, but still very stressful and have alot of pressure"
good,"CVS has a very good culture, one that fosters inclusion and diversity. With its roots as a regional company there is a family type atmosphere in most departments throughout the company."
good,I am new to this job and from what i have gathered so far is that the benefits and the pay are great and I did make some friends there really fast. Also the managers there seem really really nice and  all and I cant wait to continue working with them in my career since they are all awesome.
good,Great place to work Changes very swiftly (CVS). So much knowledge came from my supervisors they both came directly from the SME team!!!  I was proud to have both of them as leaders.Thank you Cvs
good,will allow you to move up. great people working there. have classes to properly train a technician. flexible hours. I was part time so I don't know what other benefits they had
good,"I completed my externship at CVS and the experience was excellent."
good,"It is a fast pace environment, very rewarding if you enjoy helping people. The biggest complaint I have about the pharmacy is that there is a lit of pressure on everyone to get so much done in one 12 hr day."
good,"I loved working here! Unfortunately other nonsupportive coworkers, along with becoming a mother ended my career with CVS. Great place to work at and definitely stay busy!"
good,The employees yell at you if you can't consistently  keep the line of customers moving fast. Expect you to do more than 3 things at once.Management is usually hiding and not avilable if you have questions.
good,"•	Process prescriptions via CVS software"
good,Working here has taught me a lot about being a pharmacy technician. This has also secured my thoughts on becoming a pharmacist. My crew is great we love each other but raises were not good.
good,Excellent company to work for. Senior management was always available for questions and provided great direction. I valued both my internal and external customers during my eight year tenure at Caremark.
good,It's a more quite business but in any ways you get to help your community. People who come in are usually very nice. I enjoyed working here as well I learned a lot.
good,Being a technician at CVS was wonderful because it allowed me to move state to state and have a transferrable job that allowed for growth up the ladder.
good,"At CVS Health, we share a clear purpose: helping people on their path to better health. Through our health services, plans and community pharmacists, we’re pioneering a bold new approach to total health."
good,In the end this job is just the same as working for any other company. What always matters most is the numbers. It takes them at least 5 weeks to update anything so expect to be short staffed due to that alone no matter how much info you have that numbers will increase. Even with all this it is a good safe job with competitive salary and benefits. The thing that really makes or breaks your experience is your managers.
good,I came in as a shift leader but the manager only cared about herself. She was fine at first but then did a complete personality change. I was full time but she would cut my hours. I was forced to leave because I was the sole provider for my family and couldn't pay all of my Bill's when my hours would get cut.
good,At CVS you really have to be able to do mind-numbing work for long hours but there is a lot of opportunity to be creative if you choose to have fun with it. I really enjoyed setting up displays and interacting with customers. I would recommend CVS to anyone interested in retail job opportunities.
good,"Provide excellent customer services to members"
good,Ambiente de trabajo interesante. Trabajo donde se mucha atencion y ser muy responsable.
good,I have worked for CVS in two different states and it feel the same in both work wise. The one I work for now doesn't have a union which is the only difference. Hours vary. My team is very helpful.
good,"Workplace could be productive depending on who was working that day"
good,Great experience in exemplifying customer service. Great environment for growth and learning. Everyone is very willing to help to ensure success within employees.
good,Good job to have as an entry job. I started young and it was good experience for me only being 15-16. I worked the registered and faced the store on occasions.
good,Overall I did enjoy working for CVS. No major complications and worked very well with the staff.Always had something to do and work on which I actually do appreciate because it was also never too overwhelming.
good,Overall CVS Health was a great place to work because the management team at your store location is always willing to make hours convent for people with kids and people who want the hours. They are always willing to help and listen to the employees and customers who are from the area to make the store a better environment and work space.
good,CVS taught me patience and communication skills. Also helped me better myself in the occupation of pharmacy technician. Most of the staff were nice and helpful.
good,best place ive worked. only left as i had moved to the uk. besides the amazing teamwork and corporate structure everyday was new and insightful. i moved up from a cashier to general manager making over 80k in 6 years from a 7 dollar and hour position.
good,I enjoyed my work at CVS. I was trained well and it started me in the correct path as a pharmacy technician. It was difficult at times being understaffed. We had to work hard to keep up with the work load.
good,Working at a CVS always allows more opportunities for me to gain communication skills and learn how to save money and learn about sales.  CVS is well organized and and well managed my the manager. The employees are well mannered and offers great customer service.  I'm glad that I started working at CVS because it gave me great opportunities to learn the basics of communication and how to save and understand sales and money.
good,"Management all excellent in pharmacy at employed cvs."
good,"CVS Pharmacy is a friendly, fun place to work with lots of good benefits for both your health and your family's. "
good,"Great place to start as management. Skill included payroll, sales, profit,customer service . Training associates in different job skills and people skills."
good,"Good job to learn about drugs. Difficult: Very busy so hectic. Stand all day. Pros: Flexible schedule, CVS is everywhere. The management is corporate and the managers do what they are told. A diverse place."
good,I have learned to improve my people skill. I have improved on my rebelling and typing prescriptions and I have improved on my brand and generic names and knowing what the medications are for.
good,CVS lives up to what their mission statement is. Always a friendly place to work. Able to build important interpersonal relationships with costumers. Great place.
good,"Working among of team of teams all working toward the same goal/goals.  Focused on transforming healthcare.  It has been fun to collaborate with different strategic parters to include, business partners, iT, analytics, and quality."
good,"My time at CVS was a knowledgeable, cultured, enjoyable place to work.  It is one of the top companies to work for.  It is an equal opportunity business, the benefits are great and the pay is reasonable.  My co-workers were easy to be around and the company is fair to their employee's."
good,"It was a good opportunity to learn more about medications and get connected with the patients on a daily basis, pay was low and advancement opportunity had a low chance."
good,"As a supervisor inside the retail department I opened and closed store, cashier and photo booth. I also had to order and stock shelves. staff is very limited"
good,"A typical day at work was responding to emails from different stakeholders, putting together weekly reports, reviewing quality monitoring inputs for accuracy and analyzing data for trends.  I learned that most of the stakeholders did not like change; which made it a challenge to be innovative.  Overall, the management was good. .  There was a huge gap in communication though, which became very frustrating; especially because most people are working remotely.  The hardest part of the job was staying focused despite the lack of communication. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving adhoc request at any given time.  There are certain periods when the day is predictable, but I especially enjoyed the times when the day was not so predictable."
good,I enjoyed working for the company. They would take care of their employees. They offered great benefits and discounts for the employees. They often had events to where you could bring your family to attend.
good,Usually understaffed which leads to overtime sometimes. Went through multiple managers while I was there which wasn't long. Pay is decent but not for the work load. Upside you get paid for all training.
good,"Doing insurance verification.  Calling insurance companies to verify a members benefits.  Loading the information into the computer.  I have learned how to contact insurance companies.  I have also learned new computer software.  I have a one manager and one supervisor.  Everyone gets along great and we all work as a team.  Hardest part of the job is understanding that you are doing everything right.  Insurance is very tricky, there are some many different types of insurances out there it can be very hard to understand.  Best part about the job are the co-workers.  Someone is always available if you have any questions about anything.  We are all willing to help each other."
good,Cvs Was A Ok Job But the envoirnment where the location was at downtown made it very dangerous too many homeless people and thieves but I love the overall job and my coworkers and management team
good,I have the good night crew i have been working with and also sometimes the costumers makes us very happy. but CVS was not paying the overnight differential from 2012 till 2018. but now they are paying we the those working in the overnight. and i am happy with it.
good,"I’ve worked for the company for over a year. Applied as a pharmacy tech at the age of 18 and had no experience. Was able to get registered in NJ through CVS and then Nationally certified through the company also! However, I was extremely overworked and was guaranteed a $3 pay raise once I was promoted to being lead tech but only received a $1 raise and when I fought for myself, they didn’t care or make any change to my pay so I left for a much better company doing less work for higher pay."
good,"I really enjoyed my time here. I went from cashier to pharmacy tech to shift lead in 8 months. The pay was decent but, the hours sadly weren’t there. Other than that my only issue was when I was training I was told on X date my pay and title would change. It never happened. I couldn’t afford it not to, and along with almost no hours I finally had to just leave. I am sad I had to, I enjoyed working there but, due to having bills couldn’t afford to stay."
good,Lots of training for new hire.  Trainingg at different stores.  Testing after studying training  modules.  You have the opportunity to retest several modules.
good,Cvs is a great company that stride in putting customers first and believing in helping customers with their health. Ensuring quality  medications are prescribed to help the customers remain healthy and live a long life.
good,Long term care typical day would take calls from nurses and physicians on medication doses and IV calculations.  Verifying order entry and final check.
good,"I worked for CVS for 5 years. During that time, I left the country for a mission trip (for 6 months) and they held my job until I came back. I went to nursing school while working for CVS and for two years they let me change my schedule up every time I had a new quarter schedule change at school. I loved being a pharmacy tech and I loved the pharmacists I worked for. They were truly patient advocates, enjoyed teaching patients and techs, and made the work environment (while chaotic and so so busy at times) so much fun."
good,"It was a great place to work, with excellent environment and supporting colleagues, this makes a exciting place. New ideas are accepted and encouraged,"
good,"This is a job that will always challenge you. It’s a very fast paced environment with lots of room for growth. Depending on your assigned department, there are production standards which are fairly reasonable. Managers are always giving feedback and open to feedback about the job. Very relaxed environment. No dress code, music is played throughout the day. For your first two years you will get raises roughly every 6 months. Then it’s percentage based. Benefits are great. Ample paid time off. Set schedule being m-f"
good,Working at cvs as a pharmacy technician was very rewarding because I was able to interact with patients who needed our help and i was able to help prepare their prescriptions..
good,"A place where you need to be productive and give your best towards customer service and your peers."
good,Working at CVS taught me a lot of things about how to truly treat people inside of the real world. I had many exposures to different people all from different communities and helping each person with their own unique problems was a huge learning experience.
good,"It was a Good Place to be, it has its up and downs like any other. But fair and the people where not difficult to work with. I think i learned a lot and  was not Unhappy there."
good,I enjoyed the fast paced work. It was stressful at times but helped me learn to better manage my time. The work I did was easy and I enjoyed the people I worked with.

good,"Great place to work. Good culture, nice people. Going through transition with merger with Aenta.  Management is easy to work with.  Outlined strategies for development."
good,This company brings offers good benefits. Also this company will give you a chance to move more toward a career. It also gives you a chance to work with pharmacists.
good,A good retail company to work for. People are actively given a chance to advance based off personal performance. I only left to begin a new career pertaining to my degree.
good,"CVS Health was a great job. I learned a lot about prescription Drug plans, and their flexibility and limits. CVS made working enjoyable and made sure it's employees felt recognized. The hardest part of the job was explaining pricing on the more expensive prescriptions."
good,A typical work day is high demand and lacking help. The most enjoyable part of my day is helping my reoccurring and new patients and ensuring that they are happy and satisfied with their over all experience.
good,"Worked here since I was a kid. Got promoted as soon as I was 18. Kept getting promotions through out my career there, Had to leave because I had a child."
good,"Great place to work, many opportunities to grow versus previous employees, but there are many if you are looking to advance your career. Nice peoples."
good,Days are always busy in pharmacy...never allow enough tech hours to serve customers the way appropriately which makes the job stressful and is why a lot of technicians don't stay around long.
good,"- Best job for cashier"
good,"It has been to long to accurately give what the current culture is now.  When I was there, the company had almost unlimited overtime and as long as you were not in trouble for something they gave it to you.  With all call centers, politics leads to promotion more than performance."
good,Good atmosphere. Very welcoming. Provide all the info that you need to get into working right away. Great management staff. Got along really well with my co-workers.
good,"CVS is a large company that has lots of opportunity for growth.  Management is focused on the bottom line, but does not overlook its employees and what they bring to the table."
good,Nice place to start out. Good customer service. It is very important to the company that everyone understands the value of our customers. Which is a great thing.
good,"Great place to work, learned a lot! Very willing to train employees on new things. Hard work though! Manager and team members were great to work for. Very fulfilling!"
good,"Working under the supervision of the Pharmacist was educational, I was educated on a daily basis of medications and their uses.  Just having that in my back ground does help with my current job."
good,i liked that i had alot of regular customers daily. I enjoyed assisting with prescriptions and photo kiosks. Stocking was actually not even that bad and helped to make the day go faster. long hours on your feet.
good,"Quite stressful,  High pressure Too many goals and not enough time to accomplish . The staff did not always get along. No time for breaks . The bathrooms were not sanitary"
good,"CVS went through a couple of mergers and expanded their business to health insurances. And it will have more penetration areas, but the multiple locations make it hard to co-ordinate."
good,"Great job, no complaints. I worked here during college, part time, not sure if I would work there again because I am older now and I need more compensation to support my family but at the time it was good for me."
good,"CVs is the perfect place to learn in the pharmacy field, and I enjoy to help the people through my job. I feel that I am working with professionals that I can learn from and that they will push me to take on new and challenging opportunities.People genuinely care about each other personally and work together as a team. Additionally the tasks are personally challenging and match my career goals.My employer is flexible with my family needs."
good,Back in the day CVS was one of the better retail giants to work for but they have gone the way of pinching every penny they can by reducing tech hours.
good,I enjoyed working at CVS. I was able to get extra hours that I wanted and needed. They allowed employees to pick up shifts in the cashier department up front as well to fill hours. As a pharmacy technician there was not a lot of availability for advancement.
good,". good people. great benefits. a plethora of jobs to choose from to adavance your career. bonuses could be better. other than that, no complaints just ready for something new."
good,"I like working at cvs it was very fun as well I work in a busy area so our store was always busy . So you always has to be fast ,great customer service I like the company"
good,Great Pharmacy Managers/Head Pharmacist willing to work with you on schedule and hours. Great job for while your in college or if you plan to stay with the company.

good,Great job for anyone that is still in college. Fast paced and competitive. Hard to advance to management level. Would not recommend to anyone that wants growth.
good,Very energetic with cooperative management great co-workers. The ability to take breaks and lunches a little early or a little later if needed. Monthly reviews to better understand my progress.
good,"Good company to work for"
good,"I was a pharmacy clerk, i basically ran the registers and checked the customers out with their medications. It was kind of fast paced at times but it was a good job. I would recommend this job to anyone."
good,"I enjoy my job responsibilities and love my customers. They are my reason for working there. "
good,"A typical day at work is excruciating to say the least. Lets say that the only reason employees stay is to ensure a red-less queue but thats if your team is good enough to get you there. I think that management takes advantage of employees willingness to keep up. Nothing depresses you more than leaving without filling people's scripts. Regardless, you get squeezed on hours so bad that even going to the restroom rips into the flow in the pharmacy. You're expected to do more with less. Why is it that the rating is so high, because you go to work to work and bust your a**; if you want a relaxed environment CVS is not the place for you. get ready to multitask like you've never multi tasked before."
good,I learned a lot during my internship. the staff was very friendly and very helpful with helping me learn all that was needed to learn in the pharmacy .
good,There was nothing hard about this job. Take calls and help each customer as quickly as possible and the day went by quick. Every situation was different when working here
good,CVS is a great retail pharmacy experience allowing for growth and development within its company structure. I would have no problem referring a fellow pharmacist to work for CVS and its custumers.
good,"This is just a temporary job for me until I graduate law school, but I love my job. My coworkers are great. My manager works around my class schedule and the job is really flexible."
good,"got along with people most of the time, hated the long hours we had to work but loved the pay, didn't get along with many people, felt like the boss didn't like me"
good,"Search ratings and reviews of over 600,000 companies worldwide. Get the inside scoop and find out what it's really like from people who've actually worked there"
good,A nice place to work as a pharmacy tech for any individual. A certification is required and although it gets busy the employers are very helpful and make it worth it!
good,Very stressed environment need to be able to work in a fast pace. learn to deal with customers and addressing phone calls. The training is helpful at first.
good,This is a great part time position for those who plan to advance in the healthcare field. I love the people I work with and our pharmacists are excellent too.
good,I had the opportunity to complete my externship at a CVS Careplus Pharmacy. All of the staff was very welcoming and very helpful with any questions that I had. It was also a very fun but professional environment.
good,"The job wasn't bad and the people there were relatively nice. I felt it was time to leave the nest of retail and get a job that is near my field of study, computer science."
good,"As an agent working for CVS Caremark, members call in for assistance with medication, premium billing, and plan benefits.  This allows me to learn to communicate with others and multitask. Calls are constantly coming in, so you have to be quick and precise"
good,"*40h/week"
good,I have learned so much with working in the pharmacy how to be quick on my feet and multi-task such as counting prescriptions and talking on the phone. I always look for  fast paced environment and friendly people to work with
good,"Overall, the primary functions of cashiers working for the front store include ringing up purchases, processing payments, handling customer issues, and answering questions about policies and services."
good,I enjoyed working for CVS very much. The best part of my job was the satisfied feeling that comes when in a healthcare enviroment of actually helping a patient/customer in getting the care they need. The worst part of my job was that sometimes you just can't help the person and spent alot of effort trying.
good,I love numbers so counting the meds when filling script was exciting to me.  I embarked upon this new career to be ousted out after hard work and studying to get there.
good,great place to work great pay friendly people easy work. I really enjoyed working there an would have stayed but I moved and the commute was far. grat place tho
good,Good place to work and gain skills to move up or on to other opportunities. Great place to learn how to work with all peoples on their best or worst days. It really helped me gain the skills to work with and defuse certain situations
good,"This job was a well-rounded workplace, however, it was a very fast pace job with no set time of when you the work day will end. I have a family and it was difficult for me not having the knowledge of when I would get home in the evening. Also, the drive was a bit out of the way for me due to the fact that my morning drives would sometimes take over an hour. The fellow employees were good to me, but I feel that it is time to move on with my career."
good,"Will recommend this work place.  Nice and beautiful."
good,"Although work is stressful due to lack of enough technician hours, however cvs offers great benefits and I was given leave of absence multiple times for family reasons"

good,"I cannot comment on this because I do externship only at CVS. CVS has a very good staff , the Pharmacist and the Pharmacy Technician, Pharmacy clerks and staff are very efficient"
good,"Straightforward Long Term Pharmacy support. Heavy contractor presence.which may be a problem for some people.Clash of business cultures,but a professional environment."
good,A typical day consisted of ensuring customer satisfaction and setting a high standard for the store. I learned how to be nonselective when greeting people. It was a pattern I didn't necessarily notice until management brought it to my attention.

good,I currently am a route driver that drives to Jacksonville Monday through Friday picking up Dermatology specimens and bring them back to lab in Tampa. Besides that I have the opportunity to work on the weekends.
good,"The shift was 7:00 to 4:00 Monday through Friday. "

good,"Caremark is the original pharmacy business manager and I learned quite a bit about how high dollar drugs are marketed, insurance contracting and reimbursement.  There is very little transparency in the areas of  pharmacy business managers, drug wholesalers and high dollar biopharmaceutical.  You would have to work at  the beforementioned to understand the business."
good,Great pay............................working environment is ok. The mangers are great and will.help you improve your skills. Everyone there tries to help. :)
good,"Cvs pharmacy is a very busy place to work. I enjoyed working with my team and helping patients. Working as a pharmacy technician there is always something to do: filling orders, calling patients, stocking,etc."

good,"A Nice place to work FT if that's what you are needing..."
good,the hardest part of the job was when I got sick and had to leave. Other than that this job and company was a very good fit for me. M-F 8-5 we only had mandatory OT the first week or two of every month of 2 to 4 hours a week plus more if you choose to. The cafe was off the chain very healthy and reasonable
good,My coworkers were very nice and friendly. They helped me during my transition phase. The training helped me before i started working. The system is kinda tricky to follow but can be learned along the way.

good,A typical day at work in the warehouse I would say is engaging. very loud and fast paced environment. All smiles and very little communication with coworkers. I learned the efficiency and art of patience because there was a lot of old people who moved slow. lol shifts changed in the blink of an eye and when it was time to go it was time to go. I would say the hardest part of the job overall was operating the machinery alongside other coworkers. Very strenuous and dangerous. The most enjoyable part of the day I say is going homer. lol

good,I loved meeting all the customers and helping them find exactly what they needed as well as an alternative option that might have been a bit cheaper for them then the name brand.

good,"a typical day usually involves stocking shelves with product from the back while trying to watch the front counter at all times to see if a customer approaches it in order to check out. CVS can't pay for a cashier to stay at the register 100% of the time. There is other stuff that needs to get done, but there is only 2 people working at a time. It might be different at other stores that are larger, or have a bigger clientele."

good,"Its a fast paced 24 hour pharmacy. Typical day is any where from 4 hours to 12 hours depending on shift scheduled. Management are friendly, outgoing, engaging and helpful. They are willing to work with you on schedule, days off, emergencies that may arise. We work as a team. Hardest part of the job is the not having something in stock due to shortages, out of stock or product not available. Most enjoyable part is seeing the customers smile when they know that the medicine they need is available and that they can pick it up in less than a hour on most items.

good,"The pharmacists are willing to help when you need it. You can go to them and not feel degraded. It can be a fast based environment, but I wouldn't change it for anything."
good,It can be busy at time but you always have something to do. The pay was nice but they would cut hours unexpectedly. The managers and employees were really nice. They were understanding and down to earth when it came to work schedules and time off.
good,"Effective work-life balance"
good,patients come from all walks of life

A typical day consisted of, data entry, prescription filling and greeting/taking care of guests. I learned a lot about health insurance, doctors offices and pharmacy work in general. CVS paid for my license and would have paid for me to take the Lead Tech license as well! This was by far one of the best places I'd ever worked at.I enjoyed the entirety of my time here."
good,"Great with benefits. Wonderful clients. Welcome season can be stressful. However, you will be offered assistance. Promotions are given more so on ""who you know bases""."
good,I enjoyed my time here and learned so much. I went from cashier to pharmacy quickly. To move up in this company is not too easy but not too hard either. With enough effort and well performance you can move up and obtained great skills and knowledge.
good,CVS was a great company to work for and I believe that mission and values are the highest  priority.  Colleagues are treated fairly and diversity is evident.
good,"The job helped start my career, but isn't somewhere to be long term. The employees are not given opportunities to grow, and learn the proper way. It is a busy environment and often comes with stress."
good,"A day and life at CVS pharmacy is coming into the store first thing in the morning and seeing a line of people already waiting for their medications. It is important that the technicians know the medications in the pharmacy and what they are used for. In addition, there are brand names and generic names of different medications, so we are expected to know those and what they are used for or the effects of them. The hardest part of the job is when patients comes in but their medication is not ready yet. They can come in from Urgent Care two minutes prior to coming in and expecting it to be done already."
good,"My position of a case picker is a good paying job , with good benefits for the work that you do. As a long term career choice there are better options out there."
good,Great place to work if you are okay with a call center environment. You have to be willing to take constructive criticism a lot. Back to back calls most of the time which is great if you like to stay busy like myself.
good,CVS is a great place to work if you are looking for a fast paced ever changing career in pharmacy. There is never a dull moment at the pharmacy and the pharmacy manager is AMAZING
good,"A typical day at work involved showing up on time and being logged into our telephone and computer system to be ready to start taking calls.  I learned a great deal about health care and prescription drugs.  The management overall was very good and paid close attention to our calls."

good,"Good co. To work for , they look after their employee and good benefit I just miss this place to work their are good back then but do not know today its been a while"
good,"Typical day at work is always the same,help customers,stock and clean, most enjoyable part is helping the customers. what i've learned is to be helpful"
good,I worked for them for almost 2 years.  Loved the pharmacy manager.  The experience was absolutely wonderful.  I am currently in the science field and I learned a lot about medications.
good,"As a contract worker I was treated with respect and appreciation. My supervisor(s) were professional, nice, knowledgeable, understanding, and listened. would have liked to gotten on FTE but the pay needed to be higher."
good,Nice culture there. Management could push others to work harder and give more compensation to those who worked harder but very good culture in general.
good,CVS is a good company to work for. The only reason I left is because they were not really compensating me fairly and I have to do what is best for me and my family.
good,"learn all the drugs name and classes such as generic and brand names, learn to deal with insurence and help patients get there medication in time. Learn to do inventory and stock the medications."
good,It is a good environment with coworkers that I like but one thing to consider is that people can get touchy when issues arise with there medication. It is also fairly slow to catch on to all of the intricacies of the job. Basics can be accomplished in about 6 months but there are things you can run into after more than a year working there that can be tough to handle.
good,Hectic environment.  Requirements continued to get increased but no change in the number of seconds to complete the call successfully. It was a struggle to met one's numbers in metrics.
good,it's a good job to have while you're in school and offers flexible hours depending on which location you work at. Many pharmacists that I have worked for are very understanding and is willing to work with you and your schedule.
good,very busy work days but rewarding. Learned many things while working there. The management is tough but fair. I would work for them again if something came along.
good,"Customer Service/ Cashier- Cash register management, keeping shelves stocked; Assisting the pharmacy prepared the prescriptions for the pharmacist to inspection and then put them in the appropriate storage area."
good,its a good company to work with and has great customer service. i would recommend to friend. helping out people with med and prescription. helping out patient was the greatest experience
good,"Pay isn't very competitive, but the job is consistent and never boring.  Good for people who like challenges, working in a team and helping the customers.  Can be rewarding career."
good,"I think CVS is a great company that will always grow and succeed. I wish that they provided better to pay to employees though, you work hard and don't always see if rewarded."
good,I liked working here.    I loved that I was given the responsibility to cover the IV department on the weekends.   I was given the opportunity to grow and learn IV compounding and polish my techniques and skills.   My manager was a good and fair person that would work things out with her employees.
good,CVS Health was a great company to work for if you have the right team and management.   The benefits and bonus structure are excellent if you are willing to put in the work.
good,"position was customer service because you do multiple thing like stock, pulling, cashier, and when pharmacy was packed you can help in the check out line"
good,This place allowed me to be of assistance to others from many different states! It was a phenomenal experience to add value to these people. I learned alot about medicare D and mail order!
good,It's showing CVS Health on this but the company name is Coram Health. Set up all medical equipment in patients homes and showed them how to us the equipment.
good,"Great company to get your toes wet in the pharmacy business, but would recommend to come to work ready for anything to happen. Between the angry customers and the the fast pace of the environment, thick skin is needed. But you do have the occasional customer that is nice and makes you remember why you work where you are."
good,CVS is a good company but in a state of flux with many acquisitions and repositioning in an ever changing healthcare market which present new opportunities for some employees and reduces opportunities for others. They will settle into the changes in time and opportunities will increase as long as they are well run from the executive level.
good,The pharmacy is always busy so time flies by. Teamwork and communication are very important. The company doesn't allow enough technician hours so there isn't time for employees to have a lunch break or any breaks.
good,Everyone at CVS gets the job done the correct way. Management always helped me out in any way or form whether it was a question or when I needed more training to do my job the correct way. Professionalism at CVS goes above and beyond my expectations.
good,I have learn new things working here and met new goals and experience verifying and aurthorize insurance. This place you can learn many different tactics in the medical field.
good,"My job is good I wish it had more hours, the hardest part of the job is coverage. Short on hours, The store doesn't offer enough hours to the employees"
good,A typical day was calls at 60 to 80 calls no outbound calls unless neccesary. I learned how to communicate with others. The hardest part of my job was nothing. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping others.
good,believe in god. always be a good person. make sure that you live life with no regrets and dont do anything you wont otherwise do be fair and be kind. love god
good,I emjoyed working for this company. They provided me great training when I got my pharmacy license. I learned a lot from the people employeed here and they also made it enjoyable to work there.
good,Great systems.  Strong development of systems.  I survived initial merger with CVS from Eckerd Drugs and they released me after they had their team in place.  I was the last Eckerd DM remaining and they terminated me with severance.
good,I have been with cvs for 4 yrs and love the people.  My managers are awesome. I love the hrs and a good thing about cvs is they are always willing to work with your schedule.
good,"CVS, a Fortune 25 company, provides loads of growth potential and opportunity if you thrive in a bustling, quick paced environment.  If you enjoy working with people and being busy on multiple projects, you will enjoy the benefits of personal/professional growth and opportunity!"
good,the company is a good place to work and there are friendly people who work there and also management treated you as family amazing jon and wouldn't mind working here again
good,i honestly have no idea what to say its a good job but you have to meet metric I mean pretty chill but make sure you listen to what they ask of you or your nixed
good,"The job is rewarding yet demanding. Customers  come first, accuracy and the ability to adapt are important. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the customers and coworker. the hardest part can be keeping up with the demanding incoming prescriptions and still giving good customer service. I had great coworkers and  a great pharmacist in charge to lead us in what was a time driven, customer service job."
good,"My direct supervisor has been been fantastic; in fact the entire clinical team is great.  My only real complaint is moving up in the company can be a challenge.  Even though we are a very large company, there are only a few positions of management and they rarely turn over.  Which can be a good thing in terms of company stability."
good,At times there was a lack of communication between the different levels of command.  I would hope that the management team would be more aware of what actually goes on in the office on a weekly basis.
good,Worked mainly in the RX department picking orders and help shipping them out to the stores. Also picked orders out in the warehouse. Made a lot of friends there too.
good,"Provides necessary training to move higher up on the career ladder, retail life is hectic and depending on what kind of person you are this will determine if you stay here or not , Regardless trains you to be proficient"
good,Solid company to work for. Provide you an opportunity to create a path for advancement. Good leadership and a progressive company in their field. You work hard and training program provide the tools to be successful. The hours can be long but the best part of the job are the colleagues you work with.
good,For the most part this company is good company to work for. This a chance for some growth. If you good relationship with your manger that it makes your life easier.
good,we all work together to make the workplace better. I have learned to fill prescriptions. Bill insurances. I have learned medication names and their side effects.
good,nice company to work for. professional working environment. great benefits. the pay rate for working in the pharmacy should be higher. testing on basic math skills should be implemented more.
good,Not really a work/life balance place. I worked there for many years and the expectation is that you work as many hours until the job is done. I was working 6 days a week 12-13 hour days.
good,"Gained a lot of experience on how to be a fast/efficient pharmacist."
good,CVS is a fun place to work at. It offers a chance to interact with and get to know all different types of people. Being able to help people in their journey to a healthy life is great.
good,Always started out with a meeting in that ever changing environment.  Used their software program and learned about different pharmacy prescriptions.  Got to know about how doctors operate.  The hardest part of the job was learning the codes to use.  The most enjoyable that I worked with a good group of people.
good,"Enjoyed working at the CVS printshop . I was already knowledgeable of all aspects of printing from order taking, darkroom, presses, finishing, bindery and shipping and receiving."
good,This job was okay. My only issue with CVS Caremark is that things continually changed. After learning specific job duties; different managers done thing differently. In a job like this the guidelines needs to be consistent across the board.
good,Customer service and company metrics fuel the daily objectives. This work environment relies on a strong and committed team and team leader to be successful and comfortable.
good,work environment is nice. Staffs are nice. they will train you until you  know how to work. Hours are flexible.  staffs are nice and it did not have drive - thru at the store
good,"Cut boxes then put them on  shelves for pickers , the pickets pick the product for each individual stores, then product gets sent to stores to be put on their shelves"
good,"Working at cvs allows you to gain knowledge in areas such a business management, merchandising and pharmaceuticals. In the pharmacy you learn the difference between drugs."

good,Working in retail will give you the best experience as a Pharm Tech. Meet people from all walks of life and get to know the fast paced world of pharmacy retail.
good,it was a good place to work. pay was fair. great vacation time. not overly stressful. but towards the end of the shift to get the work done it requires you to move fast.
good,"Cvs is a great first job. With the large amount of business each store gets your job is basically secure. Also for full time employees the benefits are second to none, but unless you plan on climbing the cooperate ladder there isn't much else here. I would recommend using this job to get yourself on your feet and then move on."

good,"A typical working day is quite busy and exciting.  You get to meet people everyday, help with some questions they might have regarding medications and therapeutic remedies."
good,"CVS is overall a good place to work at. It helps you improve your skills for people that want to work in the medical field one day. However the location I am working at, my pharmacy manager is not the best boss to work with. I want to feel like I am important but instead he talks to me like I am dumb and he is not concerned about my opinions at all."
good,"I had a good experience working at CVS only left  because I wanted to experience working at the hospital but I realized that retail pharmacy is way better, and I felt more appreciated"

good,It was ok to wotk there.  You definitely worked there. It was always busy. Sometimes your co workers wasn’t the best. But you could get over that part.
good,I love what do as a pharmacy tech but the compensation is just not where it should be. it could be a great place to work if it wasnt all about the scores and competition
good,Haven't worked for them in 20 years.  Anything I put down here would be out of date and fairly useless to this purpose.  But while I was there I was happy.
good,"Cvshealth distribution is an alright decent job. Paid breaks, Paid Holidays, Mandatory overtime, medical dental vision insurance plans. Fast paced job. Management knows how to appreciate your job by occasionally recompensing you with pizza and making holiday dinners. Not a bad job, only bad thing is the mandatory overtime it gets overwhelming ."
good,CVS was a great place to work because they are very accommodating to a very high extent to serve their customers as well as providing the necessary tools to work with. The excellent management personnel was very sensitive to the needs of customers and employees to improve the overall company performance. It pays at CVS to work hard because it is rewarding.

good,"upper upper management does not care"
good,"The hardest part of the job is CVS inconsistency with policy, constant changes in system and lack lack of training. Everything was learn as you go. However the staff that I worked with was great. The hours are flexible and great for students. You have to be a quick learner and a patient peoples person."
good,"very good company.  fast paced work environment.  well supported and managed company.  not many employees here have a family/kids, thus it requires a lot of time management in order to have a healthy work/life balance if you do have kids."
good,"It was nice working there,my manager was awsome but lack of carrier advancement and doing a lot of extrawork encouraged me to find another job where my effort and dedication was acknowledged and more appreciated"
good,Sometimes the hours would vary. I was part time one minute and full time the next. I was supposed to be trained to get my certification as a pharmacy tech but it seemed like it was being delayed or avoided. Toward the end of my 2 week notice they seemed like they wanted me gone anyway. I felt a racist vibe. But I found something with better pay.
good,"Stressful job but awesome teamwork helps. Close relationships with coworkers, lots of hours and OT required, lots of advancement opps. Friendly management."
good,"Appreciate the autonomy as a nurse practitioner and the work hours. Fast paced environment at times and required to maintain the clinic on your own with no additional staff. One person show but manageable considering the workload, hours and benfits."

good,"CVS health was not a bad place to work at.

A benefit was having accessibility to basically unlimited work hours by working at CVS locations in the area."

good,"Some low time and then during peak times needing back up at the register."

good,I integrated the Omnicare IT Projects via FP&A. Many moving parts including several trips to Ohio Omnicare base. CVS is a fine company run by a former pharmacist.
good,It is an interesting place to work if you like to always be learning something new.  The culture is very positive and shows that they care about the health of their customers.
good,"Great company to work for. Good management in my district. The pharmacy operating hours have been cut which has negatively affected the overall pharmacist income. Other than that, nice company to work for"
good,"Im working at Omnicare more a little more than a year, i don't get why there are so many bad reviews. I'm working in the automation department, my manager is nice and helpful. although no level of advancement but overall its not a bad place to work at. people are always helpful and willing to help, a lot of overtime opportunities but they gotta pay us more. pay sucks."

good,"I had to drive too much to be able to continue working at CVS, but it is a great place to work for someone who is looking for a decent job. The people there are friendly and the majority of the customers are friendly as well. The work that has to be done is not all that bad, and most people could do it with little trouble."
good,"I worked here for about 8 months and I truly enjoyed it. Great with working with my limited schedule and training was always given. Always had a chance to move up in the company. Downside is that there are times you want to pull your hair out because of patients getting made at you for things you cant control, so having to be able to keep cool is key."

good,"I worked as a pharmacist intern in cvs in 2005. I only worked for a few months but it a great and useful few months. I had to stop due to personal and family reasons. I learned quite a bit in that period. As a pharmacist from a foreign country, those few few months gave me a good idea of how pharmacy work is here. I'm hoping I can finish my internship hours to be able to work as a pharmacist soon."
good,Everyone cares about each other and we strive to work as a team and try to help our community by administering medication quickly but thoroughly. Employees actually care about patients.

good,"very manageable just as long as you know what your doing. it can be stressful at times when it gets busy but for the most part, as i said it is very manageable. i guess it can also depend on the store's location. the one i worked at was in between the slow and fast paced stores."
good,It's fun working here but gets stressful sometimes. Manager is very accommodation and everyone is nice. Everyone has to work weekends and there is on call once every 3 weeks.
good,Nice place to work at near beach. I was always able to get hours for the most part without problems. Techs worked as a team and some who were veterans would be set in their ways but just overlook it and do job.
good,"I worked at 2 different locations. One I was there maybe 5 mths and then I got married and moved away. The other I began working at after I had my son and while there discovered I was pregnant again.

good,Good and knowledgeable management. Solid company with good benefits. Variety of career tracks and training opportunities. Positive work environment and physical plant.
good,"Nearly always fast paced. Being accurate and efficient is a balancing act on a full-staffed day, but a mission on under-staffed ones. Having 1 tech call-out or sick on a busy day can make all the difference."

The hardest part of the job is not being able to help a customer with insurance and helping them to get the medications they need. Most enjoyable part of work is the customers/patients.

good,"A typical day at the pharmacy involved meeting and greeting customers, analyzing facial skin types and making recommendations for products for care and treatment."
good,"Good place to work, had high deductible plan but an HSA card that somewhat offset the costs. Benefits were good. Pay is terrible for what they do. Manager was horrible."
good,"Very diverse environment with many changes.  Good work life balance once you have earned it. "
good,Busy but really Nice co workers. also great for college students who are trying to work and go to school. It is fun as long as you have great communication skills

good,"This was a wonderful place to work, the staff was great just like family. Just be on time, dress neatly be kind to the costumers and everthing will work out fine."

good,"I liked this job. I only worked for 6 months but got a feel for the place. Slow paced work environment, can be boring. Good for those who prefer to work by themselves. Customers can be very rude and demanding. Management was amazing and understanding. Was offered a shift leader position and pharmacy tech training. Pay is average for the kind of job it is, don't expect a lot out of it. Hours can be finicky and can be cut unexpectedly."

But do I feel change is good with everything we have to deal with in life, it show character and potential growth."
good,easy instructions and tasks nothing too hard and good manager. Good pay for me considering I was 16 at the time but it isn't a bad place to work at :).
good,"This job provided seven days on/off flexibility. Ten hour days during the night hours provided a good tempo with a balance between staff Pharmacist experience and IV practice, the most challenging part of the practice was to be prepared to deal with any aspect of pharmacy practice as it relates to long term nursing care."
good,"Stressful, very fast paced but keeps you busy enough for time to go by quickly. Sometimes very slow. 30 minute breaks. A lot to learn and takes a while to become familiar with computer system, insurance, procedures. Lots of customer service. Enjoyable job just make sure you're getting paid as adequately as possible."
good,"Overall well organized.  But close to worker management is real determining factor of how to feel about job.  Training is good, ability to learn new skills very helpful"

good,"Cvs drives a culture in helping customers on the path to better health."
good,Working in the pharmacy was quite a while ago. It was enjoyable working with staff and helping customers. It was a great learning experience and I have taken that knowledge to other jobs.

good,"A typical day at  CVS is very busy, answering questions for patients in person and on the telephone. I have learned to be very patient and I am there to help with customers needs. Management works right along with the team to help with customers. The hardest part of the job is when you can not resolve a problem for a patient, because there is nothing more you can do. The most enjoyable part if the job is making the patients happy and seeing them smile."
good,Can really learn a lot of skills and knowledge with medications if you want a career in Pharmacy. As well as advancement a leader in the pharmacy such as a Lead Tech or Inventory specialist. If you want to stay busy then retail chain pharmacy is the best place.

good,"a typical day includes answering multiple phone calls while juggling filling prescriptions, helping customers, and typing prescriptions that come into various cues, all while being pleasant."
good,Working for this company favors more towards the customers opinion. Staff are under paid for the duties they perform on a daily. Relying on survey and scanning extra care cards for the customers.
good,Fast paced retail pharmacy but teamwork makes the dream work. Customer service is key since you see these same customers and speak to them over the phone often. Empathy can helpnin this profession too.

good,I enjoyed this job. I enjoyed patient interaction. I learned how to count pills and my communication skills enhanced by interacting with the Pharmacist throughout the day. The workplace was very peaceful. The hardest thing about the job was when we had to find ways as a team to get people who was less fortunate their medications.
good,"A typical day at work involved me filling and dispensing medications, filing insurance claims, maintaining accurate control of inventory stock of medications, and completing cash register transactions. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning more about medications. The hardest part of the job was having to learn about the different insurances and how to run them correctly."
good,"This is a no frills environment. No exercise rooms, small cubicles, and very long hours for salaried workers. They are very good at allowing flexible hours along with allowing one work from home day per week which comes in handy during the winter months."
good,"I've enjoyed my time at CVS."
good,It was a great experience since I never worked in retail. I learned a lot fro everyone even the customers. I learned about the ends and odds. Supervisors and co workers was very patient with teaching me everything that I need to do my job.
good,"Great job. very fast paced and competitive. I would recommend this hob to friends.,I think if the pay was higher, the turnover rate would be lower. My supervisor is wonderful."
good,I really enjoyed working here I meant a lot of customers that turned out to become friends with I enjoyed doing the planograms and stocking there were some issues I didn't like but I enjoyed my job and fellow employees
good,CVS pharmacy was a great place to work. Working in the pharmacy was filled with excitement and there was always new thing to be learned. Good management and good company.

good,Great place to work... It's a nice place to excel and an relaxed set environment. Great career advancement opportunities and possibilities for growth within the company.
good,CVS has a hands on policy; employees work and learn new things everyday. The workplace environment leads to advancement and success. The typical shift is 4 to 6 hours.
good,I really enjoyed the family environment and the fast paced busy data entry work.  I only left because I had an opportunity at a better salary and it was beneficial to my family.

good,I enjoyed working at CVS the atmosphere was good and the job itself was good too. I learned a lot and was given the opportunity to keep learning new things.
good,It definitely gets you started in the pharmacy field. I wouldn't say it's a job you'd want to continue for 40 years without trying to advance whether another job or through education but it's a starting point.
good,Working with people everyday in CVS pharmacy starts exactly at 8 am for me. For most of the days the work environment is fun and manageable. But there are days when not enough employees are working but we are still expected to do same amount of work load which i think unreasonable. CVS workplace is very professional and every employee is expected to be professional and be group players. The most interesting and educational part of the job is dealing with different type of customers and handling their questions. the most important thing i learned is that by being friendly and making a person smile can change his/her whole day and spread positivity in his/her day.
good,"This is a good company to work for, plenty of work to do with keeps job security for everyone. I would recommend this job to anyone that is looking. If you like LTC this is it."
good,"I enjoyed being part of the team. The store has a variety of products for sale, as well as pharmacy items. I liked the management team that I worked with."
good,At CVS you are able to learn important skills that you can carry along in your career. Some days can be busy but once you have learned all the skills involved you are able to handle the work flow. The hardest thing about the job is learning generic and brand names for medications.
good,Im at one of the fastest pace stores in the district and I have seen us approve tremendiously throughtout the year with new management and crew. We work well together and are able to juggle around all cues. I enjoy this because may day seems to be over quickly. The hardest part of this would be long never ending lines.
good,"CVS/Pharmacy is a fast pace environment, that I absolutely enjoy working in. Helping others, working as a team, depending on my co-workers and filling prescriptions."
good,"I have filled in a different CVS' and I had never had a problem. The only problem I had was when I got pregnant and had extreme morning sickness to the point that I was in the hospital, they replaced me and I didnt get my position back after I had my son."
good,This job is manual labor.  If you not on first shift you don't have a life. They keep you in the warehouse without knowing when you getting off.  Only good thing bout it is benefits
good,"Good people to work with but it can be a very difficult job, one bad thing happens and the cash register drawers could potentially be short. It is a lot of weight to put on someones shoulders but the end result goes to show that if you put your mind to it you are capable of anything."
good,Great environment but fast-paced. The co-workers and managements are amazing and most of the reason I love going back to work. I learned a lot which I can also apply to my daily life and into my future.
good,"fast pace, day goes by quick"
good,This job is ok. The  technicians could get paid more for what they have to deal with. The best part is that I you learn a lot so the job doesn't become mundane. The worst part is dealing with rude customers.
good,"A typical day at this job is answering phones, waiting on customers, calling insurance companies, and entering, counting, and filing prescriptions. Ive learned quite a bit about medications and time management. Ive learned about dealing with problems such as insurance problems and how to explain certain aspects to customers. The hardest part of my job would be getting a giant work load done in a manageable amount of time along with being attentive to customers as they come in. The most enjoyable part of my job would be working with the customers."
good,"The manager at CVS was delightful and had pursued me to come and work for her store when I left my last position.  However, even though I was considered a supervisor I was getting very few hours.  The hours I was there, there was always something to do, whether it be customer service at the register or stocking or moving stock on the shelves, so I was never bored."
good,"A typical day at work was stocking products, organizing shelves, and helping customers. The environment was very calm and easy to adjust to. The managers were nice and helpful."
good,"CVS pharmacy is a great place to work especially if you want to learn basic costumer service skills and pharmacy technician skills."
good,I never worked at CVS store before except My internship I've been completed there as a pharmacy Technician.But I heard great tings about that company. I don't have a lot of experience at this store.
good,The workplace was fine and fast-paced but it could get a little stressful due to the fact that we were usually short a person or two and one person had to do multiple things.
good,"Multi-tasking"
good,"This is a fast paced environment, the pharmacy in this store tends to get really busy and can stress you out when it comes to filling patient prescriptions quickly"
good,This is a very dependable place to work. They are friendly and have good management. Sometimes technician hours are short because of payroll restrictions.
good,"Fill prescriptions, customer service, detail orientated, fun work environment, working with solving problems, inputting data, stocking shelves, inventory."
good,Typical work days is 8 to 4 or 3 to 9. one day a week you also do 13 hour shift. You will learn lot about Insurance especially medicare and medicaid. Patient counseling  skill is also important
good,Omnicare cvs is a good place to work right out of pharmacy school.  The pay starts out decent.  Long as you work and don't get to any relations or any other problems this job is ok.
good,"I've been with CVS Pharmacy for about 8 years and have worked at 3 primary stores (due to relocating).  Overall the company has been good to me in regards to working with my schedule when I was in college, and then adjusting to a more permanent set schedule as I became a lead technician.  Unfortunately they do not seem to deal with staff issues very well - it may just be poor management at my store specifically, but I have co-workers that do not get along and the issues they have are not being addressed, upper management has been contacted - nothing ever happens though.  I think it really depends on how great the staff Pharmacists are - I've worked with a good amount and it is typically hit or miss.  The Pharmacist can make or break a store according to their attitude and work ethic."
good,Program that is used by CVS is one of the easiest to learn and teach. They have a hands on learning site where all techs go to train  and they will teach it to you as many times as you ask. You have different time frames to learn each of the different things. When I worked there they required to be signed off one on thing before they would move you to the other. This is a good place to work for someone who is freshly new to the Pharmacy Technician world and wants to get the experience they are looking for.
good,Great pay and benefits. There a chances for advancement and higher pay. Alot of very nice people. They provide anything that is needed for the job that you are doing. You have to keep up with the time requirements or they will not keep you.
good,"High demand for production, metric driven reviews.  Some customers are very demanding. No contingency in place for sick calls. Rigid staffing allowance."
good,"I started two years a go with this company, since then I learnt how to work under stressful situations by absorbing the customer's anger and frustration with explaining that his problem is fully understood and I will do my best to get it solved."
good,"Submitting orders for patients and their medications, scheduling delivery times, and verify patients information, and insurance info. Clearing orders through insurance and figuring out why some medications were rejected and getting issues resolved. Requesting overrides from insurance companies for patient to receive locally in cases of emergencies."
good,"I really did enjoy working for this company and enjoyed being in the care of the management and around the team. "
good,The job in itself is fulfilling a typical day at CVS is pretty easy going however it does have some difficult parts just like any job. communication is key is this position you have to be aware of your surroundings and laws.
good,"Working here was okay, but only issues I had was co-workers. They acted as if they never have been where you are starting from. Had a couple of run-ins with them. I will returned to work for them if I'm paid more."
good,"The environment is very face paced.  Filling prescriptions, verifying insurance, stocking shelves, and ordering medications.  The people are great to work with."
good,Taking phone calls for clients that are calling about ordering or checking status prescription. Getting their prescription card mail to them. Explaining how to use the company website.

good,"Time management was of the essence in CVS. Multi-tasking was always a plus and working with a team was vital."
good,I worked at CVS for one year during college as a pharmacist technician. Good pay for a college student and they were willing to work with my class schedule.
good,In a typical work day I manage the staff to fill prescriptions in a timely manner and I also manage the inventory of all the drugs in the pharmacy department.
good,During my team with CVS I was very fortunate to work with a great team. The pharmacy manager was great. We became family with one another as well as our customers. loved working for the second busy store in our district. That always made work productive and never bored or a dull moment.
good,"There are good and bad times, as there is gonna be with any job. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who have little or no regards to policy and rules, and who wants everything to go their way all the time."

good,Cvs is a great company to work for. I would glady work for them again.  I did work erratic hours and had to deal with people in not a good mood.  The experience is incredible and you get to meet a lot of nice people.
good,"Management is not that amazing, but the work is relatively consistent. This job will prepare you for any call center job. Change is a constant, keeping the work environment exciting. If you are prepared to dedicate a significant energy to learning the job well and utilizing all available resources to keep up with the job, this is a rewarding place to be."
good,On any typical day at work i would learn new skills such as how to manage people and get work done in a timely manner. As a pharmacy technician i learned a lot more about people and how to resolve insurance issues and get the customer what they need because it is very important to their health. The most enjoyable part of my job was the ability to help others and learn new skills while doing it.
good,"I  work on my own with assistance as needed.  I work Flexible hours in order to maintain the Hallark card section and gift wrap, but still felt like part of the team."
good,i have worked at the pharmacy and they have always been very accommodating through my pregnancy and maternity leave. it is a fast paced environment but have learned a lot none the less
good,"I learned a lot at CVS/pharmacy with great staff support, good environment to learn and grow. The management team is awesome I was training to be successful"
good,"Job culture has changed  after the merger, enjoyed working at the fast paced growing company since the beginning and thru the growing pains of the past years"
good,I enjoy the my co-workers and job overall. Since CVS purchased the company our team has been assigned a new manager that is has little knowledge of our responsibilities and how to solve problems that arise throughout the workday. This is very time consuming and increases the stress level throughout the day. Typically we spend half of the day doing data input the the other half taking inbound calls from patients.
good,This was my first pharmacy tech job.  I finally got the opportunity to put my classroom knowledge to test reading and filling pharmacy prescription mail orders.
good,be ready to work!  The day goes by quick and that is one of the pros working for cvs healthcare.  the most enjoyable part of the job is the customers

good,I've worked there 16 years. And liked working there . Had a awesome group of co-workers to work with. Ive worked 4 different stores and have liked all of them.
good,I learned about different insurances and drugs. I managed the front and sold prescriptions to patients. Hardest part of the job was multitasking but eventually I loved staying busy and helping multiple people at once because it made time go by faster. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about different drugs and their side effects.
good,Got to learn new things and meet new people as well as working as a team it was fun and i enjoyed myself and everything i learned working there with all the experiences.
good,Very enriching environment. You need to be very detail oriented and and organized. Very fast paced environment. Continually checking drug interactions and health conditions in order to ensure to proper dispensing of medicine.

good,The people that I worked with along with most of the customers was the best part about this job. The workers always made it feel like it was a family environment. The customers were some of the nicest people that I came across.
good,"Workplace is very professional. Learned how to multitask different critical situations. A typical day at work would be arriving, clocking in, and working through the 8 hour shift."
good,I enjoyed being employed at CVS. CVS was a great place for growth as a pharmacist and for the other employees as well. I do not remember a day of work that was not a learning experience.
good,The company as a whole is great to work for. They offer a lot to their employees and benefits are substantial for retail. Training is awesome and continued education (leadership training) is offered for any that want to advance.
good,"Awesome companyto stop selling Tabacco.  But not in my location. Their is not professional developemnt, they don't value education, the work and life balance is poor, they have more clients than employees to take the calls and it lead to long queues."
good,"everyday is the same kind of work. You would see what section you are assigned to pick and replace. Picking orders for the pharmacists who would put together the drugs for the customers. Then we would take the new shipment and process it, then replace it back into the shelves we picked from."
good,"No room for growth. Poorly trained and unmotivated support staff. "
good,Great management team. Excellent benefits.  Great atmosphere.  Good salaries. In general a great work place.  Good programs for employees
good,It is a good environment to work with good management.  It is competitive yet has a lot of room for advancement.  The customers are fairly fun to serve and the job itself is a great experience.
good,"The hours aren't the best if you have small children, but overall if you have a good clinic partner that will work with you on the schedule and switch days with you, this is a good place to work. The weekend requirement is every other weekend, but the clinic closes early and opens late on the weekends so I didn't mind the weekend time."
good,"Install, move, repair voice terminals.  Train users on voice terminal usage.  Maintain voice equipment, vendor meets to resolve service provider and vendor issues."
good,Great place to work. I learnt a lot from on job trainings . Great place to learn customer service skils under pressure environment on top of delivering pharmacy services.
good,Worked with great people and wonderful customers. Changes in policies are updated weekly. Would recommend to someone that is not looking for hours yet quality of workplace.
good,I like the system but there are multiple steps that all require scanned credentials. I like the work but sometimes help is limited.
good,N/A fun place to work but can pay a lot better than what it does. typical day at my store is always busy. learned the brand name drug and generic drugs. great management team.
good,"CVS is a good work environment. It does have room for advancements, and you do work with the public. Some days' can be easier than others, but each day can be a challenge. Management is very nice and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is working with the public, but the most satisfying part is knowing you helped someone."
good,"assisted customers all day"
good,It was a great place to work and had flexible ours because I commuted from another town. As a Customer Service I covered the switchboard as well as facility tours.
good,"Working at CVS I was always busy and had something to do, which I love having work to do if I don't I find something, I learned so much there like calling insurance companies and doing claims with insurance etc."
good,The company was very supportive.  The company was considerative of employee personal situations of life.  Company had very good benefits.  Company was very close to home
good,If your looking for a place to be able to help others then this is it. The benefits are great but sometimes the scheduling can be crazy if you have small children.
good,"It was not the worst job I had but it certainly was not perfect by any means. The customers were friendly enough, but some of the coworkers were less than friendly and pleasant to be around."
good,"A typical day at work is fill prescription, checkout customers in the front of the pharmacy and drive thru. I also type in prescriptions and most of all make sure the customers get their prescriptions and are content about the entire transaction. I learned something new everyday about medidations and how they are used. Time management is key in this environment, because you have to always keep up with the pace or things will get chaotic. My coworkers are like my family away from home. The hardest part about my job is having to deal with a lot  floater pharmacist coming into the pharmacy and not knowing how the day will flow. The most enjoyable part of my job is the relationships I build with the customers it really makes my day also, the impact I have on the customers."
good,"Overall, not a bad place to work. Plenty of customers to keep your day busy. Gets very frustrating when prescriptions are not filed properly and you have to spend a lot of time searching for them, thus making the customers agitated and you looking incompetent."
good,"Serving customers was fun, however sick and disabled clients' were a challenge.."
good,"Dynamic, fun, great place to work. multi skill and very professional people. "

good,I enjoy working for CVS. I love meeting the new people and trying to get new customers to come in. You feel like a family especially with the people that have been working together for a while.
good,"It depends on your boss, but it can be an enjoyable to work. Its a very good place to start for experience. You really learn alot with can be beneficial for the next job. Horrible compensation."
good,"A great place to work, good hours and great benefits! Everything runs smoothly and the days go by quick with all the hard work put in by everyone."
good,"Before CVS health took over, Caremark was running a great company. Employees could feel like they could work for the good of the public and share in the benefits of the company. Now CVS health has the control of the company employees are afraid of their job. Employees don't work more than 9 to 10 years, employees either get fired or they die at the company."
good,I loved it all. I enjoyed all my crew members. and customers were always nice to me. I mainly liked to look at some of the stuff I would plan to buy after work and get hooked up discounts.
good,"Awesome, great associates, family oriented, great benifits, policies and procedures. Easy application process., HR Department us good."
good,"On the job training is provided and you have to opportunity to learn a lot about the pharmacy industry. You are expected to stand on your feet for extended periods of time and be able to multitask. The hardest part of the job is having to attend to customers, drop offs, phone calls, drive thru, filling prescriptions, and organizing all at once with the limited amount of people in the pharmacy especially during busy hours. The rewarding part about the job is noticing the satisfaction of the customers and knowing they will come back again."
good,"I am moving and will miss this store.  I will miss the pharmacist and the store manager, as well as my coworkers.  I like working in retail as I like working with people."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working with pharmacy providers to resolve complex issues, Educating different pharmacy groups."
good,Working at CVS was an alright experience for college students or those who needed a job. They were very flexible and respectful and gave out hours when needed.
good,It was a great experience but i wish the management team did a better job at training us! We basically had to learn on our own
good,"taking call after call after call from patients, pharmacies, and doctors offices regarding prescription plans. I learned a lot about medications and what they are prescribed for. Some team leads were easier to work for than others. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry patients"
good,"i woud go in open the store, go through what task needed to be done and did what i could in a timely manner. i would ring customers up in between if needed."
good,"Both my full time and part time coincide with each other."
good,Coram CVS is a good company to work for. They provide enough training for you to complete your job and also to provide patient care.
good,"had a long run in this job . Loved every minute of it until 1 Pharmacist, that I and others could not get along with. Guess techs were more expendable than 1 pharmacist."
good,we work hard and have a timely manner to get things accomplished. it is a pharmacy that is based off productivity to get things done and to our patients.
good,plan to work really hard to achieve your goals and also having a productive team is the key. manage your task wisely. its all about the company metrics
good,CVS made transferring an easy thing to do.  I showed up in a new town and started working within a few days.  Their computer systems were the same across the board.  State laws varied and I had to accustom myself to them but the transition was easy.
good,"At OmniCare, they exemplify Core Values, Attitude and Professionalism. The show each employee respect in all actions, show respect for customers and each other. They exceed expectations in being passionate, proactive and creative. Management shows accountability both in words and actions. They achieve results by communicating openly and sharing information, listening actively and being responsive. They value honesty and integrity."

good,"Management is understanding, and very patient."
good,cvs is a good place to start a career. they allowed for on the job training to work there. the pharmacy is great. the staff is nice. good opportunities are provided
good,"Super quick super stimulating. Always something going on and needing to happen, constant progress within the company but not always its employees. When you have the right team built all is possible and all is limitless, when its not the right mix, inter agitation can disrupt Work flow and service. Strong customer focus and constant influx of news and criteria. Great place but not for the weak of heart or tortoises."
good,"OK place to work, not enough help and super busy.  not much opportunity for advancement. over worked need a different environment to work."
good,"It was hard at first to work there but I got use to it."
good,I loeld working at CVS Because it was fun The employees I worked with were great I had fun every day long breaks not alit of stocking friendly customers
good,"cannot complain over this company, great culture and everyone always seems to have such a positive outlook. i recommend this company in the pharmacy field :)"
good,"Great managers. They were all cool people. They paid me a good amount. OVER NIGHT shifts were crazy though,  I hated doing overnight at cvs. But overall a great place to work."
good,This is a great job for an aspiring pharmacist. You will learn about all the medications and the different uses. The low pay makes it hard to continue.
good,The supervisors only cared about themselves and how they looked to the higher ups. When it came down to them helping out the representatives they lagged greatly and often times reps would not receive any assistance in a call and would have to escalate a call even when it may have not been necessary to do so.
good,Hardly sleep or get days off and if your sick they count it against you so you can loose your job if your child sick Sticks you in places you didnt apply for
good,A typical day in the office is usually very busy we get a lot of work done and I'm always learning something new. Management is great they are willing to work with me and are very understanding. I get along with all me colleagues they help me when I need help and I always return the favor. The hardest thing about the job is making sure paperwork is correct and accurate. The most enjoyable would be completing the work and feeling satisfied that it was accomplished with no mistakes.
good,This job could be better. There's not enough help for cashiers from managers when the cashiers need backup with the long lines. The chip slows down the speed of checkout and to not have backup doesn't make the fast pace environment any faster.
good,This is a great organization to work for but the provider is all alone at the clinic. This make it very lonely at times since there is no one to talk to.
good,"Working for CVS Health was a great pleasure .The daily routine was completing Prior Authorization with doctors, clinics, and hospitals. The company had a diversity of employees,  everyone were well professional.  The hardest part about the job was some of the over whelming calls through out the day ."
good,"There was alot to learn and was having supporting seniors. "
good,"Busy Store"
good,"It is a very busy environment"
good,My day normal starts hectic. There are customers waiting from the time we open at 8 until maybe noon a little later. Then after school rush comes.

good,"You will learn a lot in this company.Lot of  accounts, claims, and constant multitasking. Managers are always caring for employees."
good,You have to be very strong to work in retail. You can get very nice customers to all the way worse ones who may curse you. Be ready to get yelled at daily since all the patients you get in pharmacy are sick. Very busy work.
good,"As with all companies it has its faults, however my longevity should speak volumes about the company.  "
good,"CVS is always busy. However my store has a lot of technicians so most thing will go smoothly. A typical day at work starts with checking the queues to prioritize what should be done first. Customers always come first. I learn to work in a fast pace environment. Everything needs to be done quickly yet we have to make sure the accuracy: right medications come to the right patients. Sometimes there are things beyond our hands, like insurance prior authorization, that make customers upset and that is the hardest part of my job since we want customers to have their meds so they can start the treatment."
good,"i'm quick learn and will ask question about work. I'm very hard work and always on time . I'm friendly to my co- workers until they start tell me to much about their or somebody life .

good,i loved working here. all of the co workers were great. management was good. it was a good place to start. need more hours to run the store.
good,"Each day was dedicated to certain weekly projects like truck or merchandising. As management you learn the ins and outs of your particular store and what drives sales specifically to your customers. Management is very team oriented and since each cvs is staffed with less than 7 employees you build a sort of family type atmosphere. The hardest part of the job is trying to find enough hours to get everything done, stores are not budgeted any hours over the bare minimum."

I do a lot of management to about 19 pharmacies and supervision also. All co-workers know they can depend on me with any questions and concerns they may have and never hesitate to call me. Hardest part of my job is sometimes not being able to complete all my work and having it finished until the next day and not being able to provide medications to patients who are in real need of them. The most enjoyable part of my job, is going the extra mile when medications are not covered through their insurance companies and having to call their doctor and provide an authorization from the insurance company, which can take anywhere from a few hours to a couple of days but in the end the patient gets what they need and leaves my pharmacy happy and so do I."
good,"I used to start my day with checking the list of prescription that needs to feel first and complete that and finish my daily cycle counts for the stock of the medications. "
good,Overall this is a good opportunity. The people are wonderful and they love to help. Hardest part of the job was to learn the medication uses.
good,"Customers entered, called, and drive-thru to get their prescription filled and would like to see a helpful and understanding associate to aid them with their discomfort needs."

good,soon as I come inside I go on the floor I start working  taking out supplies for the co-workers and put them on the belt so they can start picking the supplies to be ship to the different cvs stores in the U.S. The hardest part of job is keeping production. The most enjoyable part of the the job is getting gift cards from the job when we are accident free
good,"Working for C.V.S. Pharmacy really helped shape my customer service skills. I learned many new things like audits, sales add,  price changing and receiving invoices for products when checking them in. I enjoyed my supervisors they taught me everything I learned while working for the company.The hardest issue was dealing with upset customers, and trying to fix all their needs to make them happy. I met a lot of wonderful friends while working. I Don't even call them customers, because of the friendships and bonds I made."
good,"A typical day at work includes:"
good,Nice company I enjoyed working for them they have too much work load stable company they have many branches cvs too much fun during the working day

good,"Enjoyable colleagues. Productive environment. Fun competition among locations, target store goals. Decent amount of politics."
good,"Going into the nursing homes and reviewing the resident's record as well as helping nurses with their questions and concerns were my favorite parts. "
good,"too much to do with little helps. cutting so many pharmacist and tech. hours. while timing all rx must fill with  in 15 minutes. setting quota on how many to be picked up  or to be filed. "

good,"It was great when I first started there as a pharmacy tech. Loved the place, loved the people. Then the General Manager left along with a few other great people. After the new manager came in it was pretty much all down hill from there."
good,"Is a good place to work and aquire skills. Not only that it creat an environment for you to become a good leader."
good,I type all day and nothing else. I learn to always pay attention to detail. We had many managers and they were all good to work for. my co-workers were great. the sitting for 10 hours was a little hard. The benefits were awesome.
good,"Typical day come in clock in and begin the work day. The customers were awesome. Management needed a little more work on their people skills, some acted as if they were the owners of CVS and owned the employee.

good,"A typical day at work was nice. I enjoyed being able to work independently and talk to patients in a rush free way. I learned more about mail-order pharmacy, copay assistance providers and processing prior authorizations."
good,"This job is what you would typically expect of a community-based pharmacy. Typical days included customer service, quality assurance and prescription dispensing, inventory management and so forth. Pharmacist benefits and compensation is comparable to leading competitors and other pharmacies. Job is demanding, depending on the store/location, but can be quite rewarding depending on one's preferences."
good,"Daily duties were to retrieve payments from lockbox and apply to patient accounts; distribute eob's to appropriate team members; prepare account write-offs; enter account adjustments as per contractual agreements"

good,"Appreciate your hard work. "
good,CVS was a great work experience I was able to enhance my customer service skills. My co-workers and I built a strong comrade and maybe some memorable moments.
good,"When I worked at CVS I was hired on after completing my Externship. During my employment I managed to work in the Pharmacy filling prescriptions, run my own cashier as well as, sorting prescriptions on their shelves, and handling customer complaints within the confines of my Licensing restrictions rules and regulations. The people that I worked with were nice people who obviously new more than I did, and made sure that I new where I belong within that Pharmacy. The hardest part of the Job was unfortunately the experience of dealing with customers who were either impatient or rude. But what I did like about working in the Pharmacy was the few Pharmacy Techs who would provide that wonderful upbeat experience."
good,"A very good pleasant work environment and people. Open and a joy to come into work, Worked on RX connect and had a great team to back me up"
good,CVS is a great part-time experience with interaction of a variety of customers. The basic day consists of preparing medication prescriptions for customers in line with CVS policy and the Pharmacist's requirements. Good team based environment where each person has a role in order to maintain a balanced workflow. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the high demand of prescriptions that were processed for the day. The most enjoyable part of the the day was learning the different types of medications and what purpose they served and translating that to the customer if they had an questions or concerns.
good,CVS Health is a great company to work for. There is plenty of room for growth and endless opportunities to build a lifelong career.
good,"I enjoyed working with Omnicare.  At a glance to a visitor they would assume work couldn't possibly get done.  Everyone got along really  well and as  team we worked hard , played hard and still managed to "

good,Great management and training. If you have a question about  a policy or regulation management will willingly answer and explain. They are always willing to train and promote from within the company. Nice benifits and employee discounts. Check out their pharmacy tech training programs.
good,CVS provided me with the opportunity to explore other avenues within the project management department.  I worked with the real estate department numerous times in acquiring new space in multiple locations throughout the country.  I was also involved in a data center expansion project that was not part of my normal job duties.  I enjoyed working with the Information Technology team on this project and now have a better understanding of IT's role within CVS.
good,"simple work , nice environment to work with good management"
good,CVS Pharmacy allows employees to develop better communication skills through working as a team and facing new challenges.
good,"They need to have more time to train employees on different task throughout the pharmacy. When working with this company, I can say I didn't learn much expect how to count medication. Everyone was given their own specific area to work. We were never taught to work at different stations. Whether if it was filling, typing, inputing prescriptions, or etc."
good,Good work place with supportive management.  I have enjoyed my experience and received excellent remarks across a spectrum of qualifications
good,A typical work day I ran the cash register and stocked shelves. I learned how to properly deal with unhappy customers. The management was great.

good,Benefits are great! You have to be willing to show up on time. The people are awesome. Great environment of diverse people.
good,"I have enjoyed cvs, have a wonderful boss , but we needed more tech support to deal with increasing volume of rxs as well as ancillary task such as immunizations, pt outreach programs,etc."
good,"A typical day at work included a high level of customer service, stocking shelves, doing weekly promo, and preparing store for the following day. I learned that I can work 3rd shift. I worked with only four other people, so that was fine. Hardest part was the lifestyle, 3rd shift becomes that more than a job. The most enjoyable part was the combination of the actual work I was doing and my co-workers."
good,I started out as a cashier and made my way up to inventory specialist in the pharmacy. Great place to advance and wonderful people to work with.
good,Was able to learn a lot of medical terminology and how to deal with insurance companies. Very interesting work environment with a lot of benefits. Was able to work in a very professional atmosphere with the ability to use great customer service.

good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time working at CVS."
good,I enjoyed cvs. I learned a great deal from the phamacist. The people are great very busy location where I worked. I would say that cvs needs to do better with customer service and hire more help. On many occasions we were not able to fully engage with customers because we were so very busy.
good,"Interesting and challenging job with a pleasant work environment.  Opportunity to learn new technology."
good,I was satisfied with my previous employers and learned much from all of them. Nursing for me has been a very diverse career that has taken me into many different areas of patient health.
good,I loved working for this company and loved my coworkers. The only problem I ran into was try to get hours to work. I think improvement could have been made for benefits for the technicians but overall a wonderful company and staff.

good,I have learned a lot of important information that you need to learn in order to work in the medical field. You have to pay attention to detail. Awesome place work for if you like the medical field and are willing to learn.
good,"I assisted with getting many orders out the door and onto the ups truck in a timely manner. I learned how many people need to depend on the mail order pharmacy in order to get their medications, as many people cannot get out of their homes. One of the hardest parts of the job was listening to someone cry on the phone, or someone who called to say the patient has passed away. The most enjoyable part of the job, when someone writes in a letter on what a good job I've done to assist them in any way."
good,"got to meet a lot of awesome people "
good,"Good work culture which includes Fun at work, some times more stress just because of deliverable, learned a lot from CVS project from last 3 yrs."
good,overall my postion with cvs was an learning experience I learn how to gain patience and how to get the job done whe your store don't need you that day you can go to other cvs in your town and get your hours that way
good,The enjoyable part about working at cvs health was actually leaving my red wagon at the door and being able to help people get their medication they needed most of the time. Being around great attitudes make the work day go so much easier.
good,A cool place to work at. Good benefits. Nice people there. i love the job in itself a nice place to work. I really dont have much more to say
good,I was a part of great team. 18 store managers as well as corporate office employees were very helpful and enjoyable to work with. The company had great culture.
good,CVS has given me the experience to succeed on my career path. It taught me to be a team player with my colleagues and to be a professional when handling with patients/customers.

good,"long hours and little pharmacist relief help to allow for family emergencies, sick day coverage, and vacation coverage"
good,"My manager was flexible with my schedule. Just at like any other job: you give and take. It's a team effort. Most difficult part of the job was being on my feet the whole time. The unpleasant customers grew on you but shoes and proper body mechanics are more important. Learned a lot, medicine wise. It helped me out significantly in nursing school."
good,"Excellent health organization advancing in the pharmaceutical world, making changes that have cost money in the beginning such as not selling cigarettes any longer but encouraging a healthy lifestyle which will lead to longevity. Management is typically great while working under a stressful environment shows no regret in the field."
good,The most enjoyable part regarding my job is that I am consistently using my skills and learning new ones. It can be extremely stressful at times but at the end of the day it is worth it. Your customer service skills are perfected on a daily basis.
good,"I ran the cashier desk as well as the photo lab and maintenance, It was a good high school job and maybe for some after retirement looking to keep alitte busy"
good,"It's not a bad place to work. At the time I worked there, the nursing management was cleaning house. It was very hectic at times."
good,"I work at a very fast pace pharmacy, we fill about 2500 to 3000 scripts a day. It is also a very challenging place due to the language barrier (we have a lot of Somali patients who don't speak english) . However, I love the challenges and the fast pace environment because I work with a great team. I love working with both of my Pharmacists."
good,"I enjoy my job very much, great hours.My co-workers are very helpful, nice people."
good,A typical day at work would be involving answering calls from members needing to order prescriptions and coworkers were usually in a good mood.  The hardest part of the job was when a member couldn't get their medication when they needed it because there was a delayed doctor response and we would have to overnight the package to them for free of charge because we knew it wasn't the members fault that happened.
good,"CVS was very busy and fast paced. I became very good at calming the upset costumers, being accurate while filling prescriptions, and multitasking( phones, faxes,out dates, etc.)The lead pharmacist ran a very tight ship, but making the workplace as stress free as possible. The pharmacy team as a whole became family. The pharmacy was my home away from home. The things that made the pharmacy difficult would be when patients couldn't receive their medication, or didn't approve of the cost of their medication, and also  people who are on the controlled prescriptions could make a day rather difficult at times. What I enjoyed overall was helping people and the constant challenge the pharmacy provides"
good,"Great customer service skills are must, I ran the store from hiring to  firing from inventory to stocking to ordering to unloading truck to cashier."
good,the more successful you become the more the company would like to hire a labourer . Its hard to become successful if you don't practise your school success because it some times diminishes .Most of the time I read up on what I do and try and stay consistant in my schooling by review I aways have my book open .yeah its good review .
good,"Job requires confidence and knowledge of software and policies used to satisfy patients. Must show empathy, patients, and have a strong work ethic. The staff is often welcoming and respectful."
good,"I love that job  i learn a lot, got many good friends. My hard part was heavy lifting and the part that most enjoyed was when was receiving my check."
good,"counted pills, checked out of dates, packaged scripts. dealt with old and outdated equipment, as well as a ridiculous management system that relied entirely on favoritism based on who knew who. just abysmal. could not rely on management to handle real issues due to people playing sides. and way too much micromanaging going on.     i have not seen anything like it in my professional life. but my fellow employees were a joy to be around. i always hope to find others like them in future positions."
good,"High volume call center, Open to constructive criticism to better serve customers.  Excellent team player, open to various changes withing the enterprise. Enthusiastic with meeting the needs of the customers."
good,"Working overnights here was brutal. Bad area to be in at night."
good,"Talking to patients and making sure their refill has been set up properly either by outbound or inbound calls. Also, I would assist in setting up patients refills with us for the first time."
good,CVS is a great place to learn about pharmacy. They helped me prepare for my certification test. I was tought things that I believe will help me years down the road.I hated leaving my customers behind.
good,CVS/Caremark is a very serious player in the pharmaceutical industry. The technical environment is very innovative. Management is committed to producing quality products. Their QA investment is massive.
good,I had taken incoming calls from medicare  part d members. Regarding there medication and policies. I learned and gained medical terminology.
good,Great job for me at the time. You hit the floor running and had non-stop projects and tasks for the entire shift. Combined needs of customer service along with management requirements  of a 24 hour location were a positive challenge.
good,Customer were a prior for me to go to work. overall with work it was ok
good,"I fill prescriptions, counsel patients, speak with doctors and motivate my staff to provide excellent customer service."

good,"Fast place, photo processing, helpful, team player, making every customer happy, knowing your customer that come in every day."
good,We were encouraged to listen to music while translating prescriptions. The pay was great. The commute was brutal though.
good,"I love working here, only because of my co-workers. We are a wacky bunch of crazies but somehow it makes an amazing daily experience. The customers are the worst part of the day, with all their problems, but the company itself isn't responsible for that. The pay is no where close to where it needs to be for the mess we constantly have to put up with, yet I have returned to work, day after day for the same beating."
good,"There's not really much to say about this job as it was a family business. One can imagine what comes along with that. Great work life balance, though."
good,"it was fun i got excercise and also new skills i learned inventory and also how to unload a truck,"
good,"This is where I officially started my Pharmacy career. Everything was new but very interesting. The more I learned, the more I wanted to learn. I developed my interest in pharmacy working with some amazing co-workers and pharmacists."
good,I love seeing the customers smile & walk away with all there questions answered. The work place is busy keep you moving all the time & the management team was Great....
good,mostly fast pace work place management was stable learned insurance problem solving names of medications and uses of them became inventory specialist  co workers were typical tense but fun and well experienced hardest part of this job was timing the production and typing of prescriptions what I enjoy most from this job is the jokes and laughter and the new challenges that arises

good,Ability to learn how to navigate different systems per Medicare regulations and compliance.
good,"A typical day at work would consists on interactions with patients all day long, deals with third-party insurance issues. The hardest part of the job is that it can get so busy that sometimes you can get behind with other tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting patients their medication after having difficulties obtaining refills from physicians."
good,"Great company to work for. The leaders care for their employees, acceptable work-life balance (except during Welcome Season). Charitable company and employees, fun activities and events."
good,"the experince was suprising and fun learning about jobs ,systems."
good,If your fresh out of school and CVS is a great place to learn and advance your skills
good,"I love working at CVS, but not a fan of the retail environment. weekend, and holiday hours with retail pay. Not a lot of chances to advance."
good,"Long hours with good pay."
good,decent place to work at youll learn a lot if you listen and pay attention.
good,"The pharmacist and coworkers helped me as much as they can. I had counted too fast some days as well but it got work done. I learned alot more about the pharmacy like how many medications there really are,the caring staff and so on."
good,"My experience with this job was very beneficial to my growth in a professional management field. I have learned so much from this particular employment. Not only from my bosses, I had also learned so much from my co-workers. At this company, I was provided with the opportunity to learned how to:"
good,Definitely not a desk job worker. The hours are long and the pay was not worth it.
good,very pleasant coworkers. havnt been there long enough to thoroughly evaluate my job
good,CVS is a great company to work for. Their is lot of room for one to grow and learn.

good,"Making sure I complete all assignments in a timely manner"
good,"working with people to make them happy"
good,A typically day as a pharmacy technician is about team work and helping each other out. Working together and having a good team is what makes the pharmacy work productively.
good,a very good place to work at. The comapny really cares about the employees.
good,Very wonderful company to work for if you like to take care of others and want to make a differences in someones life
good,It was a great experience and I thank the company for having me. I hope to work with the company again one day. I would like to thank the company. Usually the typical work day is taking calls and placing medication orders inside a cubical office. I've learned to always be persistent in order to stay ahead. The management and coworkers I had great chemistry with. The hardest part of the job was knowing what to say when a patient asks you questions that you don't know the answer to. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around the people there.
good,You meet some very nice people and they just make your day.  When your helping people it just makes your day and I was always happy when I was helping the customers.  My co-workers were amazed at how crazy happy I always was.  The hardest part of my job was if you had someone come in that had a bit too much to drink and they were trying to buy some more and you had to say no to them.  In all though I loved to help the customers young and old.
good,Well the co-workers were great. Being a Pharmacy Tech was good and how the company goes out of the way to train you correct way and make sure you feel comfortable. Great Management always make sure that you have any question.

good,keeping a smile on and staying manageable being able to multi task and staying focus
good,"I was with CVS for about a month. I was on my last week of class training. I got sick over the weekend and missed Monday and Tuesday of class. apperently if we missed any days of school we would get write ups for each day missed. Well I got 2 write ups and I was told that if I had missed another day, I would have gotten terminated. I went to class on Wednesday only because we had our last final for training. I was still sick but I still showed up. I had a doctors note and you could even tell I was really sick. But with the doctors note the absences werent excused. So I was pretty much hanging by a straw at CVS. I had already knew that I wasnt going to go in Thursday because I knew over night I wasnt going to get better. Its a great company to work for and everything. Great benefits. But the only thing is, its not flexible with your life schedule. They put the buisness needs before your life needs. I didnt know I was going to get sick and I couldnt help it. I  would have just liked if CVS cared a little bit more about their employees and not the buisness....Hence we are the ones that are helping and taking the calls and answering the customers questions. Another thing I didnt like that much about CVS was security. They were rude. If you lost a badge or needed a temp one, they wouldnt give you one. They would either make you go home and go get it, so you would be late for work or they would make you tell your suporvisor to have them buzz you in and out for the day, which was a hassle. They were also rude and not helpful when you had questions or concerns."
good,Working the Call Center demands a calm and easy going person.
good,I work at a very high volume store in the city where there are lots of tourists and other people shopping around the area. Its fun to work in this location when increasing sales and business.
good,"I have been with CVS on and off for the past 25 years plus.  I have done everything from front cashier, pharmacy clerk, pharmacy tech, Lead pharmacy tech, Pharmacy trainer to were I am today.  "
good,On a typical day of work it can seem very hectic and overwhelming sometimes.  Everyday it always seems like something new even if something is good or bad.  I have learned a lot of skills while working with this company and everyone for the most part is very respectful of each other.  Management seems very up and down because sometimes I get the feeling like some people just don't care some days when they are at work.  Its like my co-workers sometimes they come to work just so they can leave early and it makes me feel like were losing that team mentality.  The hardest part of my job is making sure the store is neat and clean at night before leaving because it gets really messy sometimes at night. The most enjoyable part of work is the customers.  A lot of them are very friendly and polite and they are what keeps me going on a very overwhelming day at work.
good,"just regular j[[ij2h42jh1pj"
good,there are a lot of customers so staying busy isnt a problem. theres so much to be done and sometimes you dont get to finish what you need to do. but overall the people there are great and can teach you a thing or two about the pharmacy
good,Good place to work. Fast paced environment. Good benefits.
good,"My day would begin with task from the night before. Even though there were continuous new task, nothing was too overwhelming. I learned that everyone was willing to help and nit out you down even if they had to explain is a thousand times. The hardest part of the job was having to leave. The most enjoyable part was the management, they really cared and made you feel human."
good,"a nice place to grow up, you will learn more than you expect. people are friendly and helpful. good communication between managers and employees."
good,Assist pharmacists in their daily tasks. Directly involved with the receiving and dispensing of prescriptions and client/patient contact. All work is done under the direct supervision of a licensed pharmacist
good,"some co-workers nice and some mean. All the pharmacist were really nice. it was a very busy store but i learned a lot.most enjoyable part of the job was production, the hardest was drive-thru"
good,Good working conditions and great co-workers the best part of the job is interacting with the loyal customers.
good,"What I learned working for CVS is determination and dedication to that you want to accomplish.I also learned not giving up so easily,that all can be resolved if taking the right steps."
good,"Job security is great, slow to change. Internal opportunities to move plenty"
good,Assisted Pharmacist with the day to day operations in the pharmacy.
good,"I started working at CVS as a freshly Certified Pharmacy Technician and was given an opportunity to gain experience in the pharmacy (which I am forever grateful for). I had great co-workers, the majority of the customers were awesome, and starting pay at that time was good. I would sometimes help with opening and closing pharmacy area; rang up transactions; completed medication processes; data entry; ordered meds; assisted with inventory management; submitted prior authorization requests via fax and phone; called insurance providers for prescription payments;contacted doctors offices for prescription verifications and other issues. At times it was stressful because there were so many things that needed to be taken care of, but, we all helped each other out to complete all the day's tasks. I, usually, worked 32-36 hours a week, so the work/life balance was good. I was able to drop off and pick up my kids from school, and that helped a lot (very family friendly). I was there for a little over a year and it was a good experience."
good,comfortable work environment with major room for improvement
good,I learned that working in a fast pace work place takes a lot patience and time.
good,I was able to learn different things regarding coverage for medications
good,A typical day working at CVS for me is filling 300-400 prescription daily and constantly moving at a fast pace. At CVS you're learning new things non stop. I became more excel in knowing the different types of drugs and what they are use for and how to fix problems we face during billing insurance. Both my co- workers and the management team is  helpful and hard working and friendly towards customers. The hardest part of my job is not being able to advance from where I am now in the company. The thing I enjoy the most working at CVS is the reactions we get when a customers comes in and do not expect their medication to be ready and it is or when they are shocked that we can acknowledge them by their names when we see them walk to the counter.
good,"Typical place to work; great job stability. Pay is ok. I enjoyed my time there, but I was offered a better job opportunity."
good,"My best experience with CVS were our customers!"
good,very nice supervisor job is very challenging co workers are bery nice
good,I learned a lot working here. It was an amazing experience and I wish I could learn more. Because the hands on experience was great and that is exactly what I needed.
good,telling a patient that I could not find an avenue to cover their medication
good,its okay job but may be annoying sometimes but also want to watch your back from people talking about you
good,"Very comfortable enviornment."
good,"-Provide excellent customer service "
good,This is a good job for a bubble personality. Fun with associates and also with the customers.
good,"Love My team, everyone gets along and has a team spirit. Senior leaders are all welcoming and want to help in your growth and development"
good,"I enjoy doing my job daily as a pharmacist at CVS. Every time I am at work, I feel like I am giving back to the community and do my job very efficiently to be the best pharmacist I can be. I like the fact that Cvs utilizes our skills acquired from school to full use by making sure we counsel on every new medication. I have efficient team members I work with on a daily basis and it makes the job much more fulfilling. The hardest part of my job is when sometimes  dealing with angry and upset customers especially when a prescription was not called in my their doctors and i take the blame for that but I do realize is part of the job and I try to handle the situation the best way I can to make customers happy."
good,Some people had nothing but drama and sometimes I had to work the front
good,assisted medicare part d members with any of questions regarding plan and also enrolled members to plan for up coming year.
good,"Nice place to work at and nice com workers, learned how to give great customer service."
good,I loved organizing and scheduling in the office atmosphere. I was the first person the patient saw and the last impression and I took that responsibility with honor.
good,"You have to be flexible to work with CVS. Cashier, Photo, truck, stocking, etc. Most coworkers are great, and easy to befriend."
good,"Customer service rep for various accounts the company offers."
good,"CVS Caremark is an amazing company to work for, great people work there, and i can not say enough about their focus on the customer."
good,"my job was the best job I loved going to work everyday, however the management was not so good, and is the reason as too why I left, a typical day at work was coming in start out counting prescriptions immediately and then preforming data entry in between because it would get so backed up. would have been the perfect job if scheduling was done better and if cvs corporate would ensure the accurate amount of hours needed because of the amount of business that particular store did. the hardest part of the job was loosing a customer to them being sick, or insurance companies moving them around. when you work in pharmacy they do not become just a customer they practically become your family."
good,"Enjoy working retail, however, I am ready to pursue my career choice."
good,Great group of dedicated people working hard to deliver value and quality to customers.
good,"This was such a fast-paced job. I learned better time management skills. The supervisor was flexible and fair. I floated to other stores when needed, so I saw other management styles."

good,A typical work day at CVS is very busy. I work at the branch located in downtown Cleveland. Helping to run the store is not an easy task with the limited amount of staff. It is very fast paced and you have to be able to think on your feet. At CVS I learned you can go above and beyond for people however some people will never be satisfied. All you can do is to try your best each and every day. I love my coworkers. They are the glue that kept me there. I am a firm believer that if you have a good team of people often times you can gain am amazing results. You always are able to come up with new ideas. The hardest part of my job would have to be watching for theft. Mainly because we are doing so many other things at once that this can become overwhelming. The most important part of my job is that I get to help people. I am able to put into practice what I want to do everyday. In retail you run into a variety of different people. I love when I am able to help customers with their various conflicts. It brings me great joy.
good,"Working in one of the highest volume stores on the east coast,  CVS can be hectic and challenging, but I enjoy the pace. I have learned 2 different operating systems since I began working for CVS, as well as, insurance billing and inventory management. Our management staff believes in proper training to enable independence and foster comradery. The hardest part of the job is having to explain to customers that their insurance won't cover something that they need. While the most enjoyable part is the rewarding relationships that are often built with our coworkers as well as our customers."

good,CVS was a great place to work. I was fortunate to work with excellent co-workers who were very team oriented and who all had the same vision. My boss was absolutely the best and always willing to take the time to teach you something that would help you further in your pharmacy career. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the unruly customers but you were taught how to handle them in a nice and polite way and before they left they would be smiling. They equipped you with the tools to handle all situation that you may face in the pharmacy setting. GREAT Company!!!!!
good,CareMark is a productive company that was pleasant to work for. I learned to get my work done in a timely fashion in the most efficient way. Management was fair and did their jobs in a most respectable way. I enjoyed the morale we created.

good,great with a flex schedule always room for advancement great part time job for extra income team work environment
good,"A typical day working at CVS is really dependent on your location and that stores popularity w/local customers. The location I worked at tended to have a pretty slow pace and I spent most of my time restocking/facing the store and cleaning. Most days I ran the front of the store and the photo lab so when there was a rush of customers things could get kind of hectic, but the managers were usually available to help out w/any and all customer concerns. The hardest part of the job was just figuring out the old photo printing machine, which used a seven layered process of different chemical baths to process photos."
good,"A typical day at worked consisted of all day customer service. Both locations of employment were two very busy locations. I learned a lot more at the Studio City location being that I knew all the basics from the previous store. I was ready for more challenges in learning new procedures and having new responsibilities to take upon myself to complete. Having great management also helps in the work force. Having the back up and understanding of issues and how to solve them in a quicker, proficient and timely manner. I believe that working as a team with your co-workers is a very important part of a workplace. Everyone working together will make a workplace a better and much more comfortable place to be in... For everyone.. I have to say that the hardest part of a job can be where there is a problem with a customer in regards to his/her order, insurance issues, etc.. The best way to handle that is just to stay calm as well as trying to keep the customer calm as well while I handle the situation . The most enjoyable part of my job were my customers. My attitude with my customers draws them close to me in a very friendly, trusting way. I always look to their best interest and how they will benefit the best. My customers became my friends, the ones I looked forward to seeing everyday I went to work.. They were the reason I looked forward to going work! "

A tipical work day consists of electronically posting close to a million dollars of insurance payments, if an EOB is incorrect, contacting the payor and resolving the issue before posting, some days they are few errors other days errors are in the thousands. I have learned how to manage my time and stay focus. We, my co-workers and I are like family, most of us get along. The hardest part of my job is end of month closing, that's when team spirit comes alive, once you have completed your tasks it's not unusual to help another team member complete their task. We celebrate every occasion, every holiday our office is decorated to suit the occasion. We also support our football and baseball teams."

good,"I had been in LTC pharmacy prior to this, but decided to try retail again.  This was my 1st time in a major pharmacy chain.  I did enjoy the work, however found the technicians did not have as much of an opportunity to utilize their technician skills.  The hardest part of the job was having to give up this part of my work experience and instead having to do more general retail than I had anticipated.  So, after working in retail and LTC over the years, I have come to the conclusion that I am better suited and enjoy more the LTC work.  I am a dedicated worker.  I have worked very steadily since 1980, with the exception of this past year when I stopped working to care for my elderly parents, losing them both 73 days apart.  I lived with them at least 1/2 of the time in Assisted Care.  Dad had Alzheimer's and Mom had many back problems and ultimately passed from CHF.  Now that life is getting back to normal I am ultimately seeking long term employment."

We rotate stations so sometimes I maybe assigned at the register the drive thru window or drop off station. I learned how to multitask and do what work according to its importance. My co-workers are sometimes a joy and sometimes you have to deal with a lot of emotions but learn to move on and progress the purpose you were hired  for. The hardest part of my job is having to work and Sundays missing worship services because my husband is a youth minister and my church and every other Sunday my family has to go to church without me. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping others that are not feeling will get their medication is a hurry after sitting in the doctor office for hours."

good,"We work as a team when it comes to most tasks Customer service and satisfaction is our main priority at CVS/Pharmacy. A typical day at the pharmacy includes greeting customers, maintaining the inventory and stock of the store, and receiving incoming deliveries on a daily basis. The management at CVS/Pharmacy is excellent. They perform their duties according to their position  while still maintaining professionalism. The hardest part of the job is working out the stock when the delivery comes for the store. There is a lot of product and knowing where everything goes is a must! The most enjoyable part of the job is where a like one big happy family. It is also very flexible and they will work with you as best as they can."

Also, you are in charge of taking care of the patients that call in about their pharmacy bills and answer any questions that they may have. I also learned about medical insurance at this job and how challenging that can be. This is job is great for anyone who is willing to accept a challenge and go home at the end of the day feeling like they have accomplished a lot."
good,Was always able to get help from coworkers when needed since I was learning a new system.

good,"My typical ady at work consisted of walking into the pharmacy, getting my lab coat, and clocking in. From there I went through a rotation of the drive thru, the register and production. On down time we checked inventory, medications for expired dates and organized the ready medication bins. Manamgment was good, however other co workers in my specific pharmacy were rather ""laxidasical"". The hardest part of the job was memorizing the vast amount of prescriptions we sold, and the easiest part was actually filling the prescriptions and keeping patient records up to date."
good,"On a typical day at work I will type, fill, and sell customers their medications. The manager at my store is understanding and willing to assist any tech with any help they may need. My co-workers all work together to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is actually getting in contact with doctors and insurance companies. The most enjoyable part of the job is interactions with the customers."
good,Cvs is a great place to work for people that really like retail there's always someone new and interesting to meet and their vales really make it a upbeat and great place to work. Only gripe i have is that there hiring process is to extensive and training program needs a revamp i believe it should all be done in house and managers call to move up 
good,"I loved working for CVS Caremark; I enjoy being challenged! Unfortunately, not a good job match for a full-time college student/mom with a new baby. I made the decision to leave due mostly to the mandatory O/T and no option for part-time hours. I wasn't getting enough quality time with my baby and my school work started to suffer as well."

good,"Pharmacy"
good,"As an extern I have very little knowledge on the compensation/benefits, but my short experience there as one has made me want to persue a career there. The staff was friendly and very helpful to me. I know that I was there to learn and was most likely part of their job and such, but I really liked everyone. Nobody was rude to me or short with me. I think the hardest part is getting aquainted with the work pace and pharmacy set-up and trying to remember where everything went. The days went by fast, except on Sunday or Saturday. Sometimes the pharmacy was so slow it seemed to take forever. "
good,"Working in the pharmacy as a technician has taught me many things about medications, insurance companies, and how insurance companies work. A typical day is coming into work and greeting regular customers and ask how they're doing. Then normally I entered prescriptions from customers, the phone, fax, and e-faxes most of my day but I assist in production, pick-up, phone calls, cleaning and stocking the pharmacy, and other things that need to be done. "

The thing I most enjoyed about the job was having a management staff that treated us more like friends instead of looking down on us."
good,I enjoyed working at CVS as a pharmacy intern while I was in school. I worked at a rather small store that did not have a drive-thru so I was fortunate enough to work at a steady pace and could learn a lot from the pharmacists. Everyone worked as a team and cared about each other. Overall I would rate my experience at CVS as very good and would potentially consider future employment.

However, the fun of working with individuals that can be communicated with ease and enjoying a few laughs here and there about personal life while working. There is always something new that is learned, inventory management, customer service, insurance/billing information."

good,"As an extern at CVS pharmacy, this was my first work experience that I have done during the time I was in school. I come in I log into the computer. Then I either pull or fill prescriptions, organize prescriptions into file, organize drug shelves, and put away completely filled prescriptions. Management is good and up to par. The co-workers were very welcoming and they know how to train new people coming into work. The hardest part of the job was having to know the drugs and accepting new prescriptions. At the time, I never got the chance to speak to a customer face to face, so I just got nervous. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting the hang of the pharmacy environment."

good,"nice co-workers, great supervisors, got to be willing to work"
good,Co-Workers are Great
good,I have enjoyed working with the elderly patient population.
good,The CVS I worked in had a very small town feeling due to the fact that the clients had lived in this area for a long time and had moved to this pharmacy after a private pharmacy was closed after the CVS was started. I had to learn everything about this position and had excellent co-workers to teach me. The hardest part of the job was opening 100's of bottles and containers all day in order to fill the prescriptions for hours. The best part of the job was the customers and their stories about their and their families lives.

good,"When I started working at CVS, I was in the 12th grade. It was the first real job I ever had. So everything was very new to me. During my start there, my shifts were usually in the evenings from 3pm to about 10pm on a couple weekdays here and there and the weekends. So at that time it was hard but good work that I felt was easy enough to do and grow to be good at communicating and becoming a people person.

good,A typical day at work is completing 8-9 pages in the production area. that means making about 200-400 prescriptions every day and having wonderful customer service. I've learned alot at that job including being a technician for the first time and learning insurance and rejections and my drugs. Management is awesome and works with you and around you if need be. The hardest part of the job is just being able to mulitask and be in several different places at one time.

The most enjoyable part of my job, is doing my job, i am very good at it, everyone always lets me know how well i do, and how much they appreciate me, its fun doing a job that you love and are great at. The hardest part about my job is that i do a lot to help and have great skills, i deserve more then $9.00"
good,I enjoy my day at Cvs. I enjoy helping the patients when they need something. I have learned alot at CVS. I like my co-workers very nice to work with. There really isnt anything to hard about my job.
good,"it was a great experience the mangers and supervisor were all very friendly and helpful, co-workers were friendly and nice. the hours went by fast due to it not being a stressful environment."
good,"Flexible hours, state of the art photo lab, consistent pay raises."
good,its a great place to work if your looking for multi-tasking this place would be great
good,"I have worked for 20 years at CVS. I was a Pharmacist in Charge for 12 years at 2 CVS stores in Boca Raton, Florida. I then went to work the overnight shift for the next 8 years. I am presently a floater pharmacist looking to work more hours. My responsibilities included being able to understand the various insurance parameters necessary to fill an individual's Rx."
good,"I was employed by CVS for an extensive amount of time, allowing me to gain outstanding customer service skills. While working in a high volume store that served a large amount of the community, I became skilled at being able to complete tasks while interacting with customers and assisting them with whatever it is that they needed. The most enjoyable part of working for CVS was creating customer relationships with repeat customers.I learned how to stay productive, stock the floor, operate a register while keeping it balanced at all times and merchandise displays."
good,Employees are very helpful. Smooth work-flow. Some days can be really busy depending on the volume of prescriptions you are handling on a daily basis
good,"CVS company gives you a great feeling about family like company. However, the company also monitors closely all activities of your working environment which help you to get ready all the time without any delay for every action or work you perform. Aslo, the company keeps you updated and trains you all neccessary information which makes you grow in your carreer and obtain your professional satisfaction."
good,"Greatly improved my customer service skills and ability to work well with others. It's very challenging. I have become very knowledgeable about drugs because of my outstanding pharmacists' and coworkers. Customers were great. Managers were great. The hardest part was that there were periods of time when we were understaffed, so the workload became doubled. It was stressful but not impossible. It got to be very tiring and energy-consuming over time. The most enjoyable part were the people (customers, coworkers, bosses). I have much more great memories than bad experiences."
good,A very fast paced environment where employees are given some degree of control to perform their assigned duties.
good,"Allowed me learn great customer service skills. At same time, I was able to work in the Pharmacy as pharmacy technician. I learned many new medication, while I was undergraduate. During Physician assistant program, learnign new drugs was bit easier especially after being familiar with the medication name and uses on daily basis while working."
good,Most important part of a job to me is gettin the task at Hand done and complete in a timely manner and done correctly
good,Loved working there but it was blown away in the tornado wanted me to drive well over 2 hours for work and it wasnt worth it.
good,If your ready to work CVS/pharmacy is the place for you.... The only problem that I can see that you stand on your feet so I recommend so comfortable shoes
good,presented alot of opportunities.
good,Basically I did stock. The manager was great and every employee was great. I would totally work there again.
good,"I loved working at CVS. Most of my co-workers, however, didn't want to work. They were just there for a pay-check, I was there to help our customers in every possible way."
good,"Once clocked in, refill any Rx's that were waiting. Assist customers who were waiting. Make and accept phone calls for refills, Order entry any new and old Rx's. Face products on shelf, check Pharmacy inventory and order what's needed. Assist Pharmacist where needed. The hardest part of the job was having to eat while working and having to come in when staff is short but the most enjoyable were the Pharmacists and co-workers."
good,*honest co-workers
good,High volume location with excellent communication skills between staff and patients.
good,it was a hustle to get it done but for sure you will be there every one always files for taxes.
good,"People don't understand its a process we have to do. People think medications suppose to ready in 2 minutes. I work hard for the customers don't have to wait long. Co-workers are great.Hardest part of the job when you have people at Drop Off, Pick Up, Drive Thru, and Telephone Ringing at the same time, Enjoy the friendly customers and giving them there medication and everything satisfied"
good,"I love my job as a pharmacy technician. Working with patients/costumer to make sure that their medication and day goes well is all enough to make me happy. My colleagues are for the most part great people to work with, so that definitely facilitates the work experience. Overall, working at my location within CVS is worthwhile."
good,"Its a challenging job, everyday there is something new. We talk to several of people a day, and every day is a learning experience, but when i am in trouble with a problem i find my coworkers very supportive."
good,"A dynamic company with great opportunities, but you are expected to work very hard and things are constantly changing."
good,"always busy, learned different things everyday, learned different department , manual and auto packer. Managers were very professional, co-workers were also, the hardest part of the job was always errors, when we sent wrong medications to the wrong patients...the most enjoyable was met our goal every day without any errors."
good,"Each day, around 9-7, a steady crowd of customers race in and out of the CVS pharmacy. Each with their own set of problems and items that need to be adhered to. If it were not for a well focused staff and professionally managed pharmacy, the jobs we do could not successfully be completed. All of these concepts are what make the job a fun and satisfactory experience because you leave knowing you have done a days worth of hard work."
good,I worked for this company for about three months and was happy there. I helped customers with returns and register transactions.
good,CVS/Caremark is an outstanding company to work for. Great Benefits
good,"I worked here for almost a year...I would still be there today had I not moved back to California. The Management is wonderful, they care about their employees and the members. You have plenty of training prior to being left to work on your own so, you dont feel overwhelmed. They have a gym and a full caffeteria on site so you have alot of ammenities."
good,"I worked for this company before it was CVS. Back then (about 5 years ago) the name was just Caremark. There was plenty of research to do and the calls could be as long as you want, so you could really take your time. Good Pay"
good,"i've been with cvs since 1998 worked in many different locations and also cities and the work is always the same. cvs always come up with programs that are meant to help patient complience with thier medication, which is great but it adds on more work for the employee than what is worth."
good,Focus is on customer service. High volume and demand but not enough staff to provide the quality of customer service require. Good workplace culture but can be stressful.
good,"It's a nice job to start out in, but always look for better. This job is a lot of lifting and planograming. Trash and bathroom will part of your duty every day"
good,"This company is very organized and precise in its actions, fast paced and always learning something new,this company is very respectful to their employees"
good,CVS is a corporate based company that is focused on health care. They are a company that has multi locations to give ability to relocate and advance your career. Payroll Budget is low that detours the ability to get tasks done and help customers at the same time.
good,"A good place to stay busy, always something to do."
good,"I think as a first job I gained valuable experience by working at Cvs and that’s  all I can ask for. I will however be leaving still as the overnight shift is honestly kind of a depressing job, not so much because of the time but because of the many, many crackheads I see throughout the night."
good,"Have make long standing friends that I still have today.  Would not have met them if not work working here."
good,"Working here for the first time you see an famous person sometimes and you greet customer depending on what is on your Resume and certificate and experience. I rate 4.5 because when you hungry and don't have no money to pay they let you slide like once or twice a day. And then let you starved, won't even bother to ask you would you like something to eat while they on break."
good,"I enjoy being a shift-supervisor, mainly because of my manager. She has a great personality, and she is always willing to change my schedule; therefore, I can easily put in more effort in my work."
good,"Core Stores are way more difficult with a drive-thru, pick up, drop off, etc. It is very fast-paced and can be very stressful if you have a Pharmacist that doesn't want to help out"
good,It can get hectic and packed but if you just follow policy and procedures you'll be fine. The pay can be worth the hassle. Convenient  for part time students looking for easy job good pay.
good,"Flexible schedule, good benefits, fair pay. Couldn't ask for much more, managers I've had are fair and care about their employees. There are opportunities for advancement."
good,Meets expectation willing to help where needed team player support DL and AP management leader in the district trains and challenges others to be the best they can be.
good,"Great company to work for , amazing benefits . The only downside is they expect employees to reach certain criteria metrics wise . Company limits technician hours a lot ."
good,This is a great place to work for a part time job. I was able to work both job and cvs was able to work with me on hours and days I was able to work for the company.
good,I loved the fact that before you start working you receive mandatory training that really help throughout your working experience. One thing that I didn't like were the hours that we received.
good,Very rewarding to help those that genuinely need help.  Take the job if your strongest traits are patience and compassion.  You need a thick skin and the ability to know that you will be expected to solve every issue - even those out of your control.  I find the job challenging and rewarding.  Good team of staff from front store and pharmacy will make a big difference in your day!!
good,The store I started at was my local cvs which I was at for about 11 months. Then they decided I was not being properly trained and moved the training store 45mins away from the one I was suppose to be at. Other than the driving not being my hiring agreement originally and that it was not accommodated is my only complaint with cvs. The people were great and the district manager was usually reasonable with things going on in the store
good,CVS is a great company. Looking for the best their employees as well as their customers. The company is always looking for ways to better the experience for their workers and employees.
good,Overall a good company to work for. Management practices could be better but isn't terrible. Work is stable and consistent. Must be willing to adapt to the ever changing policies with the payers. Company is well vested into the community and their health and wellness needs.
good,"CVS , did not like was the shift bids and changing of the supervisors when the shift bid would take place with the new hires.  Show  to much favortism"
good,"This job was a decent introduction to what retail is really like. The tags are super obnoxious but other than that, it isnt a bad gig. Your team becomes family & friends."
good,"Great work environment with fun people to work with, store manager was the best I have ever had."
good,"Aggressive schedules, tight timelines, many interesting projects, team environment, good group of people. Many opportunites for addtional training inclusive of certifications and skillsoft classes.."
good,"CVS was very good in making it seem like a corner store or a local shop, more so than a actual job or million dollar company. The customers treat you like family as well."
good,Great work life balance flexibility. Detail training provided. I worked at a satellite office and not the SSC.  Casual working environment.  ability to learn multiple jobs is a huge plus.
good,I love working at this company. I have worked here for 3 years and I have learned so much in my time their. The atmosphere is amazing and I feel like I'm making the world a better place by being there.
good,"As with most warehouse jobs, this job was very physically demanding and fast paced. Your expected to work quickly and efficiently while on the clock. Starting pay is very high and you get benefits, but you definitely work for them. Great job if are into that type of work."
good,"Calls came in fast, and you had to work on the fly customers can get irate but you have to have a passion for a call center job. Always loved coming to work and work with my colleagues."
good,Excellent management who respect and value their employees. Very fast paced work environment. Can be stressful if not trained well. Training process is very beneficial and easy to understand.
good,its a nice place to work very good training and very helpful to and you can learn a lot the people are great and the benefits are good and you learn alot
good,"The interview was easy. The orientation made me super excited to work for the company. "
good,"CVS is an attentive company with strong core values. The training to become a Pharmacy Technician is long and vigorous, but thorough and fulfilling. The pay is low for the work expected but still considered competitive for a chain Pharmacy. The environment is fast paced and demanding, but hard work is recognized and rewarded. The management chain needs work but I have nothing but praises for my superiors and colleagues."
good,"Learning new things every single day big or small. Meeting new smiling faces and being able to help customers with questions and maybe just a simple ""where would I find"" question. I love working as a team and that's definitely the job for you if that's what you like as well."
good,My Time there was fun and i learned a lot although very challenging there are room for opportunity and growth in that area of interest. Management was respectful towards others and accessible. I would recommend it.
good,"CVS is very busy and fast pace. You can learn a lot and they do train you to learn the job. Everyone works together as a team, it can be very stressful but you get through it."
good,CVS was a great place to work. The management was friendly and very understanding. The store manager helped me with career advancement and opportunities within the company. They were able to work with me while I was a full time student in college. This is a company that is great to work for.
good,cvs have alot of opportunities. but sometimes they forget about some worked that are giving they 1000% and they dont help those ppl to get a better position in the company.
good,"You have to work a lot of nights, weekends and holidays. But they have great benefits, 401K, insuance plus holiday pay, FSA and paid vacation after just a year."
good,Compensation is decent if your full-time.  Part time hours vary (they do watch their payroll expenses).  Management is excellent.  Training is great.  Co-workers are friendly.  Very good culture.
good,"I had good time working there, my co-workers were very nice and willing to help me learn company procedures. Must have flexible hours, some days you work 8h and other days only 4h."
good,Our jobs usually began with a short meeting to cover the prior days statistics and possible injuries. Most days required to ensure the workload was evenly distributed and we worked until all of the shipments were completed.
good,Cvs is a good place to grow and to know more things about what happens in factories and a good way to learn teamwork. The best thing about the whole experience is that they’re all soo helpful when you need them.
good,"CVS was a great place to work and being my first official job I felt it was a great step into my working life; however, if a person who applies is not mentally able to withhold the task then I do no suggest this job. The team was wonderful but the management could use some improving. Overall, it was a great place to work but it can and will be tiring on most days."
good,"If you are not good with people, DO NOT  work here. Its a great company to work for but you do encounter a lot of people who will yell and act a fool. Must be able to keep composure at all times."
good,"...on who you work with and what store you work at. Your team can make or break you. I'm fortunate to work with an amazing team at a fantastic location. I have worked with the opposite at other stores. I'm on my 3rd run with CVS. I work for about 2 years leave for a while then end up going back."
good,CVS health is a great place for a first job or just something part time and there is room for advancement if you’ve been there long enough. I would only leave if I found a full time job somewhere else as you can only get full time hours if you are a manager or pharmacist.
good,CVS is a great company to be involved with patient or employee. They help save lives throughout the U.S while making sure employees have the time they need for their health and families.
good,The pharmacy is a relaxed workplace with everyone working together to ensure prescriptions are filled correctly. Store management helps when able or asks for help when needed. Only issue is employee hours are limited so employee transfers to other stores are common.
good,Friendly place to work. Loved the environment and the people we dealt with on a regular basis. I've been with the company for a while and was able to make people appreciative of life. It was a blessing and I am grateful for the opportunity
good,if your a student or if you need extra change in your pocket but you cant live off of it you will definitely need a primary job where you can meke more more and actually take care of your day to day.
good,"If you are looking for a job that requires you to do more than one task at a time, then this is the job for you. It can get hectic around Snowbird season and you will be managing both the sales floor and the register. You may face challenging customers, and the hours aren't all that consistent. However, management is wonderful. If you ever needed time off or had vacation hours just sitting within your account, they will let you know right away. As a cashier, you will have to both help customers look for things and ring them up at the register. You will also have to take passport photos, assist them with photo uploads at the kiosks, as well as do general store upkeep. It can get overwhelming during the holiday season and usually there are only two employees working at the front at any given time. "
good,"Assists pharmacists in processing prescriptions and maintaining the pharmacy department."
good,I used to love working for cvs the pay and hours were amazing but then everything went down hill. I would recommend this job for first time but not a long term
good,"I left for a better opportunity to advance in my career."
good,I enjoy working at CVS i can work as much as i can and work as little as i want. The only thing that makes it difficult is the hours they give you. Im only given 20 hours a week but I can work at different pharmacies and maintain and get  full time benefits. though my main pharmacy struggles with the lack of tech hours and makes the job more difficult then it needs to be. Cause of the lack of hours sometimes we can't give our patients the attention their needing though we do try our best.
good,"The best part of working here the last 4 years was the friendships I've made along the way. Whenever I got to work, it always felt like coming home to a family. Though working retail can be challenging and test one's patience, having great coworkers and a great boss really help make it worthwhile!"
good,Time management is a must.  Day goes by quickly due to fast pace and hour cuts.  Colleagues and customers make working there worthwhile as well as additional activities if you are willing to ask.
good,Good job but very hard to move up in the company. The daily emails are very helpful when it comes to errors. Staff is very kind and will help if you have any questions.
good,"I enjoy working for CVS and am very grateful for the opportunity to gain experience as a technician, but they have greatly decreased my hours to a non livable amount..."
good,This company is a great place to start for customer service. I grew my skills in customer service and was promoted twice there after. This company had multiple departments to choose from.
good,"I loved working at CVS! It was a great environment and I enjoyed working with my peers as well as a good management team. Although, I worked the overnight shift, the hours were great and the traffic was light but the work load was always big! But thats what makes your job fun, you can zone out in your own section and get your job done! Issues were always solved promptly and efficiently! I would recommend anyone serious, who wants to apply, to go for it! Theres nothing to hard about the job because any issue is easy to solve!"
good,"I’m sorry I lost this job. I could have done big things. This was fun, constantly something to do and challenging.   I got to learn so much and so quickly because I am a hard working person"
good,CVS offers good benefits and is a good place to work. There is opportunity for advancement and professional growth. Leadership is supportive and approachable.
good,"The typical day was cleaning the floor, filling the coolers, cleaning the floors unloading truck, merchandise incoming freight, customer service, cashier"
good,"Worked in an understaffed, incredibly busy pharmacy. Loved the people I worked with, but the store didn't do enough to keep its employees and didn't hire more people which it desperately needed to do."
good,"The company has expectations for you as a pharmacist to promote adherence which mainly consist of phone calls and point of sale conversation. More times than not, I will walk into 20 to 30 prescriber phone calls (can take all morning while checking scripts on the other screen), 10 new scripts pick up calls, and burst calls. It is really not possible to execute all of the expectations and safely check prescriptions or to finish the days work on time. However, you just do what you can. It is even tougher with the company's focus on cutting technician hours. Should a good technician leave you'll need to hire quickly. However the hiring process is long and you wont see your new hire for a month. It'll put you in a difficult situation if have a good tech leave or even worse a wave of techs leave. A new or bad tech can sink your pharmacy. And you'll get stuck doing a few people jobs. Try to hire proactively, but be prepared to tell the applicant you don't have any hours for the immediate future. Good techs are typically kids in school with limited availability. Those with good availability are not there bc they want to be, they are there bc it is entry level. A good tech with good availability is absolute gold. Treating that one well is what'll make your pharmacy run. Two pharmacist per store. If your partner is bad be ready to play clean up every shift. The pay is excellent."
good,It was a pretty good company to work for. There was a lot of changes over the years. Worked with some great people. I kept a positive atmosphere with the employees. Try to encourage great customer service.
good,"As a pharmacy tech at CVS, there never was a boring day at work. Filling prescriptions, contacting doctors, insurance companies, other pharmacies. My favorite aspect was working with prescription data entry."
good,"Could be been better pay,management is good and profesionel ."
good,"Working with infusion claim make them a clean so it can be process in a fast way  and accurate with all the information   an documentation AOB, PP, DIF, EOB, and others  documents that can    qualify the claim"
good,Very good place to work if you’re in the Ennis area.  There is good management and very cool people that work there (at least in the outbound department)
good,I enjoyed my time with CVS Health. The micromanaging for such a relaxed environment was overwhelming at times. The workload was amazing.The team I worked with was very pleasant
good,"- ensured that the assigned plan was fully functioning and that all participating departments were abiding to their processes an regulations"
good,"Because of CVS Health, I've learned what I actually wanted in my career. Management is AWFUL but training is thorough and amazing. You're given all of the tools to be successful in any role you apply for with this company."
good,"Great place to grow your career and develop your skills. If you have good management skills, you can balance work and life. There are always ups and downs in management, but CVS is a great place to work and gives you the chance to run your store and pharmacy like it is your own business."
good,CVS is a great company to work for. You work with great people. Cvs pays good especially if you come from out the company in management. Cvs provides many way to move within the company and grow.
good,"Great place to contribute entry level skills, as well great place for advancements. I was able to obtain my state pharmacy license through the company."
good,This company has been great. However they are trying to make it into a retail type establishment. Long Term Care pharmacy is completely different than retail.
good,The job is okay the pay is okay the benefits are great.  There are many opportunities to expand within the company.  However i don't believe they compensate the employee according to the expectations.
good,"Autonomous work, with flexible schedule.  However, management often changed."
good,"Very Customer Service type atmosphere in the work culture.  It was major part of the interview, training, and daily job expectations.  Great Customer Service was noticed and rewarded."
good,"Not a bad place to work for a decent pay. Please were nice, have to work with a lot of customers, and due to insurance sometimes you have to keep your cool"
good,"Management controls the pharmacy. If you don't have good management it's not a fun work place. You also need a good team. We all work together. And hustle. Well, you should anyways."
good,"Cvs is a good company to work for, they help and offer all training tools that is needed to help all customers. They reward you with points if you are doing a great job"
good,I learned a lot at CVS. I was taught how to be patient with people especially the elderly and how to perfect my customer service skills. I loved working at CVS as a tech but management did suck.
good,"i enjoyed the classes that they sent you to , to be able to learn more about pharmacy. The hours was wonderful and the staff was great and amazing . i would recommend to anyone wanting to do pharmacy"
good,"Working in the pharmacy at cvs was a pleasure. days go by extremely fast and constantly helping in one of the 5 stations of the pharmacy. Pay could be better, but other than that it was a good place to work."
good,"Calling client to refill their prescriptions"
good,Cvs is a nice workplace and they have good customer service. The staff at Cvs are really friendly and the benefits are good. There are a lot of sales in Cvs and the discount should be 20-30% for employees
good,"Good place to work.  The company has grown in the past 30 years.  You are more like a number than an actual employee.  Good benefits, 401K, health, vision."
good,"I worked at CVS pharmacy inside Target. The experience is slightly different than a regular CVS pharmacy since most of the patients transitioned from Target Pharmacy. The team adopted to the change well. The transition as smooth. Overall, I had a great experience working with both CVS and Target."
good,"There are many opportunities for advancement. CVS is located throughout the nation and the work culture and pace varies among the stores. Pharmacy managers and district manager were actively involved in my professional growth. I learned almost every aspect of the job that was required to be a successful pharmacist. Overall I had a great experience, especially during my last year of employment. Hardest part of job was keeping up with the volume and learning to multitask. Most enjoyable part was being at the forefront of patient care, interacting with patients, and working with great teams."
good,Fun to work here. The only bad thing is that they are so busy given it was a 24hr pharmacy. Some days I barely had time to stop and catch a break. That was the only bad thing.
good,"It's an overall calm and relaxing atmosphere. Typically on the phone all day, but you have time to relax in between calls. Most times it is pleasant, job is demanding, but easy to work throughout the day. The company is understanding and helpful to your needs. They have great benefits and working with people and improving their health is top priority."
good,The job is okay. The only problem I've had is with my benefits. They put me in the system as part time even though I was hired full time so I was unable to get insurance when I should have.
good,"Worked with CVS health (call center) for over a year and resigned from my position recently. I had the most awesome and sweetest supervisor anyone could ever ask for (I was very lucky). My co-workers were very great to get along with. One of my dislikes about the position is that unlike normal stats, we had something called ""idle time"" to where we would literally have to keep tapping on our keyboards. Even in between calls, while holding, while transferring just ""tap, tap tap"". If you stop tapping, itll show up on your stats that you were idled x percentage of the time during the day. I honestly thought it was a waste of good reflexes. Other than that, my experience have been quite alright. Health benefits available after 90 days, Plenty of vacation, and floating holidays. 30% off cvs branded items, 20% off of remaining non sale products at cvs. I would def recommend."
good,Great place to work with many new projects and acquisition activity. You'll never be worried about lack of work. It is very militarily structured with great management.
good,"I went through their private training and it was excellent. Fast paced environment. Learned to enter data more quickly. I focused a lot on calling customers for refill reminders and inventory control."
good,I had a decent experience at CVS for the total 65 hours give or take. In the coarse of the few weeks I restocked shelf's and helping out customers and bringing back in the shopping carts.
good,"Cvs is a good place to work. Overall supervisor are fair and follow protocol, they have a great traing program for people who like to advance and move up."
good,"Although it was fast paced. You were provided with the tools to do your job adequately. As a Team Lead, I always provided my reps with access to succeed with my guidance."
good,"The company makes it easy for you to move up internally, although it is not consistent. This changes based on where you are located. Management varies wildly across the board."
good,"friendly  place decent pay, fast paced. keeps you busy everyone is a team player. support from management. decent work life balance occurrence policy decent vacation"
good,The PIC (pharmacist in charge) at my store is wonderful. She really cares about her employees and takes the time to listen to their needs and concerns. She is a very sweet woman and is one of the best bosses I've ever worked under!
good,"CVS is a great place to learn how to deal with people and different personalities.  I enjoyed the excitement f it all, as I grew relationships with a lot  of the customers."
good,"this company, which began as sterling drugs and was purchased by omnicare. The place has a great working environment and they have numerous employees who have been there 20 yrs. it's like a family. most enjoyable part of job was the staff. the hardest part is not being adequately compensated for my work."
good,"CVS Health is not perfect but overall, the company tries to walk the talk. In the corporate office you are surrounded by extremely smart people. So, you have to bring you best everyday. If you don't, it is obvious to those around you (including leadership) "
good,CVS gave me training that allowed me to grasp the basic duties of a pharmacy technician.  Being a pharmacy technician requires a decent amount of knowledge and expertise to be efficient and I do not believe the pay is exactly up to par with the stress levels of the job.
good,Excelente empresa. Área tranquila y positiva. Empleados comprometidos con la salud de sus pacientes.
good,"Organized balance flow as long as your strong techs are spread out through the day to help new hires and other technicians."
good,"You are always learning, always moving, and always thinking. It is important to always stay on track and be focused on what you are doing. You fill prescriptions, help drive-thru, check patients out at the register, and provide your full service and help."
good,CVS was a good company to work for. I enjoyed working in the medical field because you can really make a difference in someone else's life. I would highly recommend working for this company.
good,"The people are fantastic, but for the amount of work that you do and the level of pay there is a very large gap. They expect a lot from their employee's while not paying very well. Yes, they do pay more than other retail type of businesses which is a bonus but it is not for everyone if you do not like keeping very busy every day. The managers seemingly have to place the company over their own lives as if someone calls out and no one can fill the shift the manager HAS to do it and that is not fair to them. So the people you work with are everything.The benefits though are top notch!"
good,Great job to be a part of. I loved helping customers on a daily basis. I learned a lot about insurance issues. The management at CVS was something that I could work with. They worked with as best they could with whatever aspects they could.
good,I've been with the company for 10 years and i enjoy working with all of my employees. I'm quick at data entry and production. I would like to go further with any pharmacy that will give me that opportunity. I also sometimes work in the front store as a cashier to help out our I'll go to another store to help out of needed. As lead technician i also handle paper work and inventory.
good,"I enjoyed working for CVS.  It was fast paced, but there were excellent technicians and I enjoyed working with all of them.  I was robbed twice during my tenure on Dauphin Island Parkway Mobile.  Despite, the negative aspects, I built very strong relationships with many customers there."
good,"CVS was a very low-stress working environment, which was very conducive to productivity. They were very fair in their PTO practices which allowed for a great work/life balance."
good,Customer service insuring my customers had a satisfying shopping experience. Train all staff in department  and product knowledge. Assist the pharmacy department with prescriptions .Managing the daily operation and learned to deal with and all situations and correct them.
good,very competitive warehouse with great performenced based incentives which made it fun. very fast - paced work place that requires you to be on your feet for 12 hours a day
good,"Fast paced. Typical day: orders come in electronically and are sorted and split into appropriate queues by tech or RPH for long term care patients or psych hospital patients, and processed accordingly. You can zoom in on hard to read orders to help read them. Volume can be massive. Hardest part is drug files are not cleaned up and have to go through multiple steps to reconstruct the order to match the exact NDC (all 11 digits!) with what is actually on the shelf that day. We wind up “chasing our tail” undoing one another’s work because “return to stock” items have to be considered...a situation one would not encounter in retail. Unlike many retail jobs, you can go to the restroom without a big deal, and you can dress comfortably because you are not seen by the public."
good,"Results and tracking results are the main focus of CVS.  Each person is held accountable for their daily, weekly, and monthly duties.  This is not a place if one is looking to relax and play games.  The focus is on the customer and how our services can best impact their health  We have great colleagues at CVS that are dedicated to their position and have fun getting the job done.  If one is serious about their position and the tasks that are required; CVS is a great place to work and learn."
good,"I worked in the pharmacy which was very busy. Some days we didn't have enough help which made it very stressful. But I do miss the customers. I had a kidney transplant and I've had a lot of issues so it got harder for me to work due to illness from the transplant so between the company and I, it was decided that I be let go."
good,"work at CVS Coram was very rewarding and satisfying. Each day was met with challenges, however taught me to push myself and complete all tasks necessary. The manger I personally reported to was excellent, always available for all questions and concerns. The coworkers were a joy to work with. All in all, the work atmosphere was quite enjoyable."
good,"great staff overall. you must be able to handle such a busy setting that is none stop all day! "
good,"A typical day at CVS started and ended the same, which was picking and packing orders to be sent to various stores in a fast pace. I think the constant fast pace was good, made the day go by faster."
good,"More money based on job perrformances and work ethics to those employees that stand out than just a few coins"
good,Hours are flexible and work load is consistent. There is no bad thing about CVS except shoplifters. Otherwise this is a nice place to work. Management ensures enough cashiers are on duty.
good,Sales positions are flexible but requires discipline and good judgement to exercise autonomy. Need to be able to work as part of a team to meet a common goal.
good,it's a wonderful place to work if you like being on the phones all day. The people are very nice to work with. There are some supervisors and managers who need a little more training on how to deal with team members.
good,"In a typical day at work as a customer service/cashier, you clack in and start processing transactions for customers that are already in line waiting to be helped with their orders, answering calls is also part of the job. I learned a lot of things while working for CVS, one of the most important things that I learned is how to interact with co-workers and customers, how to deal with everyday challenges at work, and how to be professional at all times with your co-workers and customers alike. The work culture at CVS is very diverse and well organized. The hardest part of the job was at the very beginning when I had to learn how to process transactions, but nothing that can't be overcome with persistence. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people of all different backgrounds."
good,Co-workers are very understandable and easy to get along with. There's more to being a pharmacy teach than you think. It's not always about just filling prescriptions
good,"Nice place to work, pleasant environment, co-workers willing to help and teach you what you need to know, onboarding process could use some improvements to be sure new employees have the tools they need"
good,"CVS is a good company to work for, for the most part. As long as you do your work you should have nothing to complain about. The work is not difficult."
good,"Some good days, some bad. Not always safe. Busy, standing job with easily-upset customers and lots of insurance frustrations. Some days and customers were great, though! Every day was something new, and I mean that in a good way: I never got bored. Unfortunately, I'd be worried to work there these days with the current opioid crisis and increased threat of robbery."
good,"really great professional work setting. great benefits for our family's."
good,"Pharmacy management well organized, offers flexibility with scheduling, supports growth in company, learned a lot about different use of medications rx and otc.  Staff works as a team"
good,"•	Manage employees shift and creating a work schedule each week"
good,the time I worked there it was alright not that many shopped there so it was slow some days and it a good thing also not that many people were cashier so the line would be long with only one person.
good,"Good culture, productive environment, engaged staff. good work life balance great benefit great hours. energetic, positive energy. Break room is cold."
good,I enjoyed working for CVS. Because when I took this job I was taking care of a sick family member and this job allowed my the time I needed to take care of my family. As a card specialist my hours were very flexible but the downside was the traveling from store to store and the lack of real hours.
good,Arrive at work on time ot your shift. I started in processing film thlen advanced to the pharmacy as a tech. I learned how to fill prescriptions and to answer customers questions. The management were very good to the staff. The hardest part of the job was remembering all the names of the drugs and where they were located.The most emjoyable part of the job was the laughterand trust we had for one another.
good,CVS is a great company to work for. However the policy on working  with the employees in a crisis sometimes is unfair. A typical work day is assisting multiple customers retrieve RX records. I learned multiple HIPPA compliant policies and procedures. the management team is great with supporting their team colleagues. The Diversity in the workplace is equally overcoming for all minorities. the hardest part of the job would be not having enough time in a day to complete required task even when working as a team. the most enjoyable part is everyone is like family and respectful towards one another.
good,"CVS Health is hit or miss in all aspects. Some areas have great work/life balance, others do not. Some have fantastic managers who invest in their employees while others have some that play favorites or are not good at managing people. The benefits aren't bad but they aren't anything special either. Since this is healthcare, job security is very high, though advancement is very difficult after a certain point (I.E.: going above account management). The job culture is fickle in the sense that some people like what they are doing and are willing to step in and help when and where needed whereas some people are just there for a paycheck and get exasperated when something extra is asked of them."
good,"Very team-focused environment.  Sufficient payroll and excellent benefits and opportunity for advancement.  Annual compensation increases in the form of raises and bonuses.  You work alongside your team and your boss so although still metric-driven, lots of opportunities for recognition exist."
good,"I love working at CVS. It is a fairly laid back place to work as long as you do you job in a timely manner. Filling prescriptions is my favorite part of my job. I am still learning different aspects of the pharmacy jobs. I struggle a little with the insurance issues, but I am learning new things every day. "
good,CVS was ok lots of work sometimes the methods did not make the job easy patients were very unhappy with the way we had to do things after CVS took over target pharmacy
good,"I worked at CVS for a little while, maybe 5 months. It started as a summer job, but the pay was good and the environment was fun, so I decided to stick around."
good,A typical day at work would be setting up everything and getting the meals prepared for customers such as breakfast and then creating different recipes throughout the week.
good,This job in my opinion was a great job I truly enjoyed it. I resigned due to my schedule conflict with school. I had a great team and the actual job was fairly easy.
good,"I loved the people I worked with and the job itself but I had to leave due to the job being too high stress. Overall I loved my time there, but my health was more important."
good,"It has a sustainable business model. Have learned a lot of its business. As to training, it is more on job training and no  formal training has been provided by the management."
good,"This is a good place to work, with good pay, benefits, fitness center, and the opportunity to work from home.  I learned a lot about myself in working with seniors and patience.  Good listening skills is a must.  The hardest part of the job is being monitored on every call.  Lots of fun events weekly.  If you're stressed, you can walk into the fitness center and do a quick work out to get re-centered."
good,"My pharmacy work environment is a fast pace type. We need to prioritize since sometimes we need to take care of several patients at the same time. We most fill prescriptions for waiters, acute orders, answer phone calls, type prescriptions into the computer system, rebill insurances, council patients regarding medications, etc. I always like to maintain a positive and a professional attitude. A sincere smile or a how can I help you is the best therapy for patients. The most important outcome is to have  happy customers."
good,"Very fast and time consuming, productivity and professionalism was always graded. Customer satisfaction was guaranteed and the staff always had a smile."
good,"As a manager, you do most of the work. Cashiers mostly handle customers. There is lots of free time though. The pay is low though. They do not value skills to dollars there. If you quit, they just replace you with someone who will take less money"
good,What I have learned most since working with the company is how to properly balance my time for all tasks that need to be completed. Timing is the key.
good,"I find that Omnicare was a very great extern site. It was a very physical job, walking through a warehouse-like setting finding drugs/products I needed in order to label them for patient prescriptions. I was not compensated as I was externing to acquire experience."
good,"Over 21 years I adjusted to six company mergers and acquisitions with the founding company PCS (Pharmaceutical Card System).  The company was very supportive with my training and development skills, and funded many training seminars throughout my career with them."
good,The hardest part of my job was having to tell customers that I would be unable to help them get the medications they needed. I think that the most important thing that I learned was the importance of making customers happy.
good,"Lot of work to do, must be face and take brakes at the right time or you will fall behind. My only mistakes there was I stop a few times at the wrong time."
good,"Fast pace "
good,"Its a very nice place to work , you do learn about how Medicare plans does work ,and you can learn ..Fun work environment, everyone gets along and helps each other. .It is a fast faced environment, there is always something to do. Never bored."
good,"I was a cvs customer service associate, which basically put all products on display, cleaned a lot and help whatever customer needed assistance. It's a great job."
good,Everyday consisted of helping customers and meeting their needs from helping them find a certain pain relief pill or calling another store for a specific baby formula. Customers were nice and even stopped in often just for conversation at time.
good,"The workload was a good mix of busy and interesting. I learned a lot of useful skills during my time there. The management was good with some disconnect, probably because of the size of the company, that affected the size of the departments. The standards that were passed down were usually reasonable. "
good,"Ok work place, just wish they paid more money. I like my job and my staff, they are really awesome people. If anyone apply for the job they will love it."
good,Excellent retail pharmacy experience. They provided me with the employees and training I needed to be on their retail pharmacy team.
good,"I count myself fortunate to work for a company that helps people on their path to better health."
good,My experience with CVS Pharmacy was great due to the managers. They were very understanding with my college schedule and with my availability. The only issue was working with employees who got away with long breaks due to the relationships with the managers.
good,"Good for starting out. Competition makes the wages earned look bad because they offer more for more money. "
good,"Great first job for someone looking to get into the customer service field. Working together as a team to get things done, unloading trucks , stocking and so on."
good,"I enjoyed working for CVS. Nice part time job. Laid back work place. Customer service driven company. Not only do they care about their customers, they really care for their employees."
good,The work environment was easy going and management was amazing and flexible. This company taught me how to work well with people of different age groups and also how to work with those in need or those who are sick. The best part of this job was working with the older population and helping them succeed with their health. I honestly loved this job.
good,Great work/life balance. Excellent benefits and perks. Open atmosphere and work environment. Busy work schedule on a daily basis.
good,"There is always something to do at work, so you'll always be busy as well as you are always interacting with people in every situation there can possible be. If everyone can play a part as a team the work flow of the day can be easy. Just need more employees in the company to cause less stress upon the employees already in the company."
good,I always had great time working there because we had has a wonderful group of coworkers who were very fun and helpful. Also dealing with customers was good experience.
good,"Great place to work. I've worked at two other pharmacies and like cvs the most! flexible schedule, laid back managers. The pay isn't the best."
good,"There isn't a typical day but in general days would start between 7 & 8am. Preparation for a meeting would commence or a continuation of a project from the previous day would start. There were usually multiple meetings during the day & week for a number of projects."
good,"Fun fast paced "
good,"My days at cvs were not bad at all. A typical day consisted of running the register as well as other duties. Such as distributing merchandise to the sales floor, hanging up sales tags for the upcoming week, and any other things that needed to be done ."
good,"Good Job,working constantly,good environment,nice customers,have to put forth the effort and just work,great customers,great customers,great customers"
good,"Adrima recently acquired M. LECO and Associates.  M. Leco was a very friendly family based organization.   Everyone work together as a family.  As a Account Manager, my day was never the same two days in a row.   I learned a lot about communication, problem solving, account management and the Healthcare Financial world."
good,The job is very fast paced and stressful.  I learned to use my patience and understanding with patients.  My co-workers are extremely dedicated and hard working.  Management is on our side 100% of the time.  The toughest part of the job is having an over abundance of work and being understaffed.  I enjoy completing orders for patients in a timely manner.
good,"Most days were slow, but when patients rushed in for their medication you had to be on your toes. Running back and forth, pulling, and filling the right medications for the waiting patients. I learned a small portion of insurances, and cost of medications. Management was great, without the Pharmacist manager things would get hectic, he kept us in a pattern of quick, fast paced work flow and helped us get things done. We were all a team, we worked together to achieve the best customer satisfaction, whilst teaching me the extern how to properly look up patients records, refill rx's, and a tad about insurance. I hope to learn as I go. The hardest part of the job was telling patients their insurance did not cover their medication. I enjoyed making patients happy and their CVS experience wonderful."
good,"* I have learned many new technologies while working ."
good,Awesome team! Really comfortable to work in this facility. The staff is great and well rounded. Willing to teach and very understanding. Environment is really welcoming and friendly. Manager is very helpful and also a great leader. You can learn so much if you decide to work here.
good,"I had an great experience working at CVS Pharmacy. I had such an great opportunity. I had the chance to work in three different states such as Michigan, Texas, and Florida. I would recommend working for this company for sure!"
good,"Working at CVS is very convenient, and interesting. I've learned more by working as a pharmacy technician about overall health and pharmaceutical practices than I could've ever learned on my own. The hardest part of the job can be dealing with the customers directly, but at the same time it could also be the most rewarding part of the job."
good,"Working for CVS Caremark Specialty Pharmacy was great. I learned a lot of new computer skills when it came to the Microsoft programs, such as Excel and Word. Also became well acquainted with how health insurance companies work and how important HIPAA laws are when it comes to the safety of both the client and the company. Had the opportunity to enhance my verbal skills through the phone and how to communicate better with people, while becoming more deft in my typing and filing skills."
good,"the only downside to working at CVS is that you have to be working there for a really long time to receive pay raises. Overall easy job, good environment, but can get very busy."
good,"good work environment, good co workers and is easy to learn what I need to do. To be a good worker and communicate with customers."
good,I enjoyed my time as a trainer at CVS. I liked that I had a hand in making sure employees were comfortable in their job roles once they got onto the floor.
good,"Soon as I get into work, clock in, auto in to the phones and start pulling orders from the queue. throughout the day you get a max of 10 calls. during peek/welcome season you ca receive up to 20 calls or more while you are also making calls and pulling orders. new employees have to max 6 orders per hour. perms have to reach 13/hr and exceeding would be 15/hr  ."
good,The work load was well balanced daily so both quantity quality could reached with little stress.There was good employee/management relationship.CVS Offered a great compensation package.Very dedicated employees.Holiday demands were very challenging.
good,"Use a cart to gather stock, open the boxes to supply to split case to pick for individual store orders by maintaining accuracy and neatness without damaging the material"
good,"The job is productive and if you like doing new thing daily, then this job is for you. You get to experience different things on each call, every situation is different.I learned how to calculate prescription and day supply.The co workers are very nice. The management is great they work with you if you want to move up in the company.The hardest part of the job is the different systems you have to access to perform your job. The enjoyable part of the job is the benefits, and helping patients receive there medications."
good,"CVS  organized time  based tasks place, it is well organized  and  managed . CVS depends micro-management system, able the supervisions to watch and track anything  happing in the pharmacy."
good,"typical day is busy with customers and phone, medications and computers'"
good,"The most enjoyable  fun place to work, had good management. place you could grow and further you employment. world wide stores. greeted you with a smile."
good,We started working as soon as we entered the pharmacy. Customers are waiting at the front register and at drive-thru for pharmacy to open and start work. Everyone in the pharmacy worked very hard and non-stop. I liked working with my coworkers.  They never took their 15 minutes breaks because they knew no one was their to cover them.  Everyone had to do multitask to keep up with the work load.  We had work board which we used to assign places and work to individual technician.  This helped us manage and organze the pharmacy.
good,An agile environment where collaboration was the norm. Smart team members who all worked at making sure deliverables were never late.
good,"Customer service inbound calls on drug benefits,copays,eligibility,deductibles.Involved in working the retail help desk on rejected claims at local pharmacy. Superior Management group always supportive and encouraged our growth in the workplace. Employed with this company for 20 years and was graced with working  with some of the most hard working and positive people I have had the pleasure to know in this life time. Hardest part ot the job was when encountering a medication that was not covered by a specific drug plan and informing patient no coverage was provided or limited on a certain quantity. Our mission statement""Helping people to  better health"""
good,working for this company was ok it was very unorganized at times. The pay was good but the store can be busy with lack of staff.
good,"Typical day is preparing customer orders for the employees to process. Employee payroll. Pull weekly production statistics for the employees (weekly reviews). Monitor production floor. Train new hires. Conduct Coachings/ Audits for the low performing employees. I LOVE MY JOB. BEEN HERE FOR LITTLE OVER 16 YEARS. NICE CLEAN ATMOSPHERE. WORK BEHIND THE SCENES. NOT WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC. 1ST SHIFT, MONDAY THRU FRIDAY."
good,"I enjoy the fast pace, it makes the day go by quick.  Typical day: waiting on customer, filling prescriptions. We all get along very well.  Hardest part is dealing with upset customers but we're always professional"
good,"The same as CVS Pharmacy. Includes customer service, typical technician duties, knowledge of medication, and  insurances."
good,"Generally helping customers and answering phones, filling prescriptions and counting pills, calling insurance companies about issues and figuring out insurance claims. The hardest part of the job is balancing the time and getting everything done correctly and promptly, while the easiest part is helping the customers get what they need. I never had any complaints about the people I worked with or my managers, as I enjoyed working with all of them."
good,"I really enjoyed working with all my co-workers and Management"
good,CVS was the most difficult place I have ever worked for.  Not physically demanding but mentally.  Customer service was a huge part of my job whether it be in front of the cash register or on the phone for PCQ calls.  Overall the experience I gained from CVS was priceless and it got me ready for any pharmacy related job.
good,Everyday was a new task to overcome but working with very experienced co-workers made everything run smoothly. Always a fast paced environment.
good,"A typical day in the pharmacy is busy and involves multi-tasking as you balance entering prescriptions, speaking to patients; insurance companies; doctor's offices, etc.The work requires being meticulous and detail oriented.  There  are frequent fundamental and elementary consultations that are provided. The difficult part of this job is there is more work to be completed than there is time in the  day. However, co-workers are supportive and will come to your aid.  You are constantly growing and learning which entails learning about a new drug and its benefits and side effects and certainly interfacing with many characteristics and needs in our patients/customers. I enjoy serving our patients/customers. People genuinely need help and appreciate someone who cares of which is far more than just  doing your job of which is the absolute bare minimum."
good,"A typical day at CVS would consist of helping out at least a hundred customers. Some more pleasant then others, but working there taught me patience and how to react more professionally to difficult circumstances. I work along side with a great team. My manager is very understandable to family issues that could pop up and flexible with weekly scheduling. My co-workers are phenomenal. Always ready to fill in any hours needed and willing to lend a helping hand to those in need of one. Id say the only hard part of the job is dealing with the more difficult customers on a daily basis. Over-all its a pleasant work place with a team that fits perfectly together."
good,Provided patients with excellent service.Management was okay. Learned how to work with co-workers. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with mail order policies and procedures. Most enjoyable part of the job was making quota
good,When I first started the program we were taught to take the returns and make sure they were properly put back. I had to stock the shelves and put them in proper order for each aisle. I would greet the customers and ask if they needed anything. I have learned to be more personable and friendly. The hardest part of the job was the unloading trucks. The most enjoyable was being able to interact with the customers.
good,"Working with refilling medications, making copay payment and premium billing payments.  Explaining plan design to members.  My coworkers were very supportive to me when I was new to the floor.  I had a lot of support from Subject Matter Experts and Supervisors also."
good,"A typical day at work is usually stressful. What kept me going was the fact that i love my job. Overall, it is a good company."
good,"Most everyone there is nice, easy to get a long with. It's a great learning opportunity with being in a retail pharmacy. You get to learn a lot more skills here because it is such a small store you get more responsibility's unlike working in a larger store."
good,I had great hours and pay. The job was rewarding and I had the opportunity to work with wonderful co-workers. My manager was very supportive and easy to please. The company also had decent insurance benefits.
good,"Enjoy my work, ethical company to work for. Good Pay and benefits. High volume Pharmacies, 14 hr work days with no breaks."
good,"My typical workday included census processing, insurance setup, contacting facilities and maintaining a great relationship with my assigned facilities. i learned a great deal of medical terminology and how to set up insurance for patients. This was an amazing work experience."
good,"It was a fast paced environment with wonderful co-workers. Duties included customer service,filling scripts,typing scripts and helping the pharmacist with other various duties."
good,"Data Center Operations is high stress; but it is also an exciting place to work. There is never a dull moment, when managing Operators as well as performing typical managerial duties. This job is not for the faint of heart, for sure; but I can honestly say it has been the most fulfilling job of my career, to date."
good,Enjoyed working there and learned a lot about medical settings. I learned about how to work with difficult customers and situations.
good,This was a summer job only. It could not coop with my school schedule in the fall.
good,Nonstop environment you get to work multiple work stations during shift
good,There was always something to do whether it was stocking shelves or keeping yourself busy with filling prescriptions.
good,"My co-workers were ver helpful, we worked as a team to make sure we get paitents meds to them in a timley matter"
good,"Doing my daily reports"
good,"A typical day here for me was just assisting the pharmacist and the customers. I was the closing tech so my duties ranged from working in drop off, pick-up, and the drive-thru window. I was responsible for filling prescriptions stocking, and running the cash register. This was my first technician job after finishing school so I learned a lot. I learned what to do at drop off, what to look for on certain types of rescriptions, and just how to be a pharmacy technician. The hardest part of this job was just the learning process. The most enjoyable part were my co-workers. They were very helpful."
good,Productive and enjoyable workplace. I got along with everyone I worked with and the hardest part of the job was dealing with some customers and unloading/putting up the delivery truck. I was always nice and respectful no matter the situation. The enjoyable part of he job was those customers that really showed that they appreciated you.
good,I was pleased to work for this hospital there was room for growth and I decided to go back to school because of all the tool and training they gave me to further my career
good,CVS is a decent place to work for pharmacy. By constantly being busy I have learned so much about different medications; I feel I'm not just working but I'm always learning. The one down side I have found is CVS has some of the lowest paid technicians.
good,I've learned a lot working with the company. managers was great I love the employees ive worked with. i enjoyed helping others
good,"Your typical day at CVS is based on customer service. They are the engine that runs the entire business. You are also the ""middle man."" You receive and provide information to doctors, insurance companies, and the patients. Time restraints are placed on every prescription. They have to be done by a certain time, either given to you by the patient or facilities calling them in, or you will be penalized. The work environment takes a large amount of mental stability and the employees have to stay calm during times of heavy workload. I love taking care of each of my patients. If I can find them ways to save money even without using their insurance, I do it without hesitation. I believe that my coworkers help me through each and every day. You have to be able to smile at work and enjoy yourself, and they make it that much easier. They management in the pharmacy is great. They are always there if you have a question and are willing to help you no matter the problem."
good,"The Company is a good place however compared to other companies doing the same Job the pay is HORRIBLE. they do offer overtime BUT the base pay is only 20,000 for a Customer Service Rep. When you have places like caremark starting at 27-30k a year this is nothing. The hardest part of the job is RUDE CUSTOMERS. The best part are the employees. I work with some really nice people."
good,"A typical day in the pharmacy is extremely busy and is a high stress level environment. Nonetheless, my team makes it bearable for me and makes my job a lot easier. As long as you have a positive attitude and a smile, it gets you through the day :)"
good,"My day at work consisted of Major Customer Service, Heavy Data Entry, incoming and outbound calls, Filling prescriptions, Etc.... Basically Heavy Multi tasking. Every day was a learning experience as far as making sure we understood exactly what the doctors need for the patients. Accuracy played a very important role in my everyday work load. Management was very helpful to me  on a daily bases. My co-workers were very excellent team players. We worked so well together to meet our work load expectations daily. Due to my team, this made my our work flow so smooth. So i can't really say the job was hard. The most enjoyable part of my job was Working in the field i am Excellent in. I loved my customers and my knowlege of the position i was hired for."
good,"CVS is a great company to work for, my manager was amazing as well. The main downfall was not working around my schedule"
good,great pay and hours! i love this job i just wish they had more permanent positions instead of temporary jobs. After 5 months they lay you off for 3 months then hire you back again.
good,Challenging but definitely rewarding. The customer that come to my store can be hostile at times but definitely just need undivided attention in regards to their medication. I found that when I heeded to one customer at a time and made them feel important the way the approached and interacted with me changed drastically.
good,"Busy store, co-workers are very helpful and friendly. Nice work environment."
good,"CVS Caremark is a really fun place to work. The employees are like family, and they surely welcome newcomers with open arms. The pay is fair for what is being done at the job. It's billing of prescriptions or the CVS pharmacies and other umbrella pharmacies. Insurance verification is apart of this position as well. This is a good place to start an career."
good,"All of the workers stay busy even on a slow day"
good,"Good company to work for-national chain, advancement opportunities"
good,I've been with CVS for almost 9 yrs and it's been great!!! Of course you have your occasional bosses/coworkers who get on your nerves or just don't like but hey you learn to deal with it! Our store is union so maybe that's why I love the benefits and job security...then again I'm an awesome lead tech so that makes it easy lol!!! District staff is really helpful also....and strict when it's time but overall we enjoy working for CVS but hate bugging pts with all those adherence calls!!! Definitely recommend as a great place to work!
good,Business casual workplace and a commitment to excellence and a moral code of good faith as we were handling sensitive information both patient and sponsor.(s)
good,"fun to work with my coworkers, kind of quiet and serious place when i  joined but im the kind of guy that needs to make people laugh and smile , customer or coworker i  make you laugh"
good,"went to skilled nursing and assisted living facilities and audited resident charts to qualify for Medicare Part B billing."
good,"Customer Service, prescription refills, inventory, new prescriptions,"
good,"Starting out at CVS, I was told I would have room for advancement even in the ranks of a pharmacy technician. Nearly two months in, I'm still stuck doing the pick-up and drive-through windows because they need me there."
good,"Respected organization. Management/personnel relationships well-handled. Clientele usually expressed gratitude and appreciation of services; importance of confidentiality;customer service a fulfilling experience by development of personal relationships; hardest job was untangling insurance coverage issues, but usually successful;co-workers treated with respect which was reciprocated"
good,"as lead tech i come in and set up for the day i look over who is coming in for the day so that i can better delegate tasks as the day goes. very fast past environment, before you know it your shift is over. my techs are great we have done a great job learning to work together as a team along side wonderful pharmacists to make the day run smoothly while completing all required tasks to keep all our numbers up and continue to be at the top or our district and of course making sure our customers always have a great experience as that is our number one goal."
good,Always fast paced and never a dull moment always learning and room to grow.
good,Overall I love working for CVS and how helpful and friendly the co-workers are.
good,"CVS has been great to me, the benefits are great, the work environment is fast-paced (which I like), and it was a great stepping stone in my career as a pharmacy technician."
good,you can advance within the company and have more goals accomplished
good,it's a good job to have while going to school in the medical field
good,"A typicle day at work would be me arriving there and right away start processing prescriptions and always watching the line so it does not get to long and ordering vials, caps, coats, legal paper, plain white paper, prescription pads, etc. at the same time while calling doctors office to verify control prescriptions they faxed the night before. I've learned to multi-task very well and to manage my time very well to were I can finish all my work on time. My co-workers are very funny to work with, I guess you can say were like a family especially whenwe spend most of our day there. We argue sometimes when we think one of us is wrong but we never let the situation escalate to the point were we stop talking to each other or let it affect our job enviroment. The hardest part of my job has been how to learn to say no to others. I would take so much responsibilities on that I would stress out and now I know that I'am not the only worker there so I shouldnt be stressing myself out. But the most enjoyable part of my job are my customers they make me really happy especially the ones that I really have a connection with they always tend to make me smile and they always leave the store with a smile and a laugh. Thats how i know im doing my job right when my customers are happy."
good,"It was exactly what I want to do in my field as a phar,acy technician which included working on tpns and compounds. The people who work there are awesome."
good,"The start of the day usually includes making the daily scheduling boards, cashing out patients, answering phone calls, cycle counting drug orders and inventory on shelves. Closing duties included restocking vials, labels, cleaning the pharmacy, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely making the patient happy and hearing that you have done a good job, as well as encouragement and teamwork from your co-workers. The hardest part is when working severely understaffed. However, working understaffed should not be a reason to be less productive, it should instead be a moment taken to rise the occasion and work to the best of your ability to give great service. The management at my place of employment varied, depending on who was on duty, some managers were very hands on with the pharmacy even willing to help out if needed, others had more of the do-it-yourself approach. I personally was able to adapt to both forms of leadership styles."
good,This job is busy but rewarding. There is always room for advancement
good,"Working for this company was very enjoyable. The co-workers were very friendly as well as helpful. Everyone always worked as a team. I looked forward to going into work everyday. Customer Service is one of my strongest values. A typical day at work consisted of customer service through out the day, from making and receiving phone calls."
good,"received,processed and prepared for shipping over 120 prescription per hour ,being incontrol gets more work done and out the door ,any problems that accure management always there to help out, teamwork is something we take pride in at cvs caremark with atleast 90% of enployees ,the hardest part is the other 10% that dont see the inportance of our jobs , knowing that at the end of the day we all did a great job as a team."
good,"I learned much in 13 years."
good,"In photo, set up machines, read test strips for the film processor. Start on film processing and developing film and printing the pictures. In pharmacy, waited on customers and filled prescriptions. Learned so much in both departments on how these industries work. Had wonderful managers, and my co-workers were always willing to lend a hand if necessary."
good,"The hardest part is keeping up with the demands of the job on the payroll hours allotted for the stores, you will 70 or more hours every week as a mgr for CVS."
good,"I come in to work everyday at 5:30am to 5:45am to clock in at 6:00am every morning. I work Monday through Friday till 2:30pm."
good,"CVS Caremark has produced a great working environment and the Systems Support team is an absolutely awesome group of people. Not only is the team knowledgeable and hard-working, but they make are the kind of people with which you are excited to work."
good,"I traveled to all the stores in the district, helping with audits and inventory. I loved not being in the same place everyday."
good,love to have family functions and alright people to work with.
good,"cashier"
good,CVS Pharmacy is a very fasted paced that kept me on my toes a lot.  I enjoyed working with my colleagues and also appreciated the clean work place.
good,"My typical work day is from 7am-330pm M-Fri. Prfetty much go to meetings and deliver the needs for our business and vendors that are required. Work with my department in application support that is through out the company. The management is good, they will listen to ideas to make it better or easier for the business and clients, open door policy. Co-workers I can proudly say we all work well with one another and pretty much get the job or porject completed by the due date from the business or clients. The hardest part of the job is sometimes you do not get ALL the requirments needed to perform the needs the business or client is asking. Mosy enjoyable part of my job is that I interact with people everyday and help them to the best of my abilities to fufil their requests. "
good,"Working in the pharmacy at CVS can be very hectic, and you aren't paid accordingly for all the work that is done.  Customers are very demanding and want your full attention- as the customer deserves.  Not much room for advancement, and the pay isn't anything to brag about."
good,I loved working in the Pharmacy at CVS. It was a great learning experience and I miss it terribly. I loved taking Dr calls and helping patients with all of their needs. The hardest part of the job was trying to remember the names of medications and their generic versions. 
good,"A typical day at work was very , very busy. The CVS I worked at was a very large volume store. I learned how to work at a fast pace, while maintaining patient safety and integrity of the product. I also learned how to diffuse and deal with difficult customers. My co-workers were very focused and intent on serving all the customers with equal respect. The hardest part of the job was learning to manipulate and understand insurance issues some were easier than others, but learning why this or that was rejected and how to fix it in the system was confusing. The most enjoyable part of the job was participating in a team that I knew would make a difference with patients."
good,"This job was a great opportunity for me. I started working for Longs Drugs in 2002, between being in and out of college, as a full time employee. I received good benefits, and regular 40 hour workweeks. When I decided to return to school full time, I was able to transfer to a store near my school of choice and work part time. The management was very accommodating giving me hours that fit into my school schedule. CVS Pharmacy bought out longs and I was able to keep my position and wage. "
good,"I loved the people I worked with, but the district management micro-managed, and didn't seem to care about the customers or the employees. Only numbers mattered. The benefits were good, and the store management was competent."
good,"As a cashier the day is pretty typical responsibility wise. My manager is a pretty fun and laid back guy but had to enforce customer service policies from the higher ups. I just saw these policies, like email collection and flu shot promotions, as part of the job and not too much of a hassle. The best part of the job was the coworkers; working in a small store brings everyone close together."
good,I love the area where i was working at. I felt challenge every day when i was at work. I loved working with my co workers. My manager was real cool.
good,the hours are very flexible. Training in many areas available. experience with managment has been both positive and negative. co-workers have been great. the hardest part of the job is problem resolution. the most enjoyable part of the job is recieving positive feed back from customers and coworkers.
good,Typical day very long. Learned a lot about pharmacy Great co-workers. Hardest part was working ten and twelve hours a day on your feet. The enjoyable was setting planograms.
good,"My job is a fast pace job with a lot of exposure with customer and high rate of customer service. At times it can be very challenging to juggle between front store, homehealth department and Pharmacy but nevertheless it is fun and enjoyable.Everyday is a learning process which make the job fun and time fly so fast."
good,Typical day is very busy and fast paced!! I love everyone I work with. I find myself frustrated that CVS does not allow enough hours during the day for help. We often feel overworked. That would be the hardest part of my job.
good,Great company to work for. Looks out for its employees. Hires within and works with employee on personal and related issues.
good,There are high expectations given to the Inside Sales Representative and if time and schedule are managed well there is a major chance for success.
good,"What loved about this company opportunity to grow, on going training to become pharmacy technicians."
good,"My typical day as a department lead was to handle ""hot issues""for customers who were sick of waiting for answers that were not being handled properly. I had to resolve the issues and get the medications out to these customers in a 24 to 48 hour time frame. I really think this postion really helped me out with my customer service skills, and in providing great service to my customers regardless of where I was. The management team at the facility where I worked was great, with the excetption of my departments manager. She was new to our department and didn't know much, but she thought that she knew it all. She didn't like me so getting along with her was tough. I worked with an excellent group of co-workers, we worked a lot of overtime and spent a lot of time together. We were like a family. My supervisior was great! She really understood her functions as a supervisor and was great to all of her staff, she helped everyone out! The hardest part of my job was to try and get a long with my manager. The most enjoyable part of my job is when you get recognized for doing good for your customers, and when you get recognized as a team throughout the organization."
good,"Exciting company to work for, Very educational. Delt with medicare members and enrollment issues."
good,"If you have never done retail management before, CVS is a great company to start at and learn to grow. Stores are smaller with less employees which allows you to grow and work on your management and leadership skills."
good,"CVS is an extremely busy pharmacy, filling and data entry all day long. I have learned inventory management skills, 3rd party adjudication, drug information. I have gained a lot of knowledge in the past 3 years there. I just love our team there. We all work so well together, and help each other out all the time. The hardest part of the job is making sure all prescriptions are filled within the very tight time constraints given by the CVS company. The most enjoyable part of my job is the wonderful relationships I have developed with our clientele."
good,"I worked as a PA rep, and I landed the job with zero prior pharmacy tech experience. So, this is a job that certified Pharmacy techs can get with little to no experience. Plus, it pays better than retail or even hospital positions do. The catch is Caremark will not actually hire you until you've at least shown yourself to be competent through an extended temp agency contract."
good,"Inbound/Outbound calls, Take escalated calls, provide assistance to members regarding website and e-mail inquiries. I work with my team to help improve the work flow process. Provide coaching to agents. Train new and existing employees."
good,"Providing a caring and welcome environment to customers who are in need of medication to improve or maintain the quality of life. Entering prescriptions, filling prescriptions, filing, troubleshooting and ringing up the orders on the register."
good,"When I start my evening shift at CVS, everything is happening at once. I am responsible for assigning employees their tasks and breaks for the night. I multi-task with my own projects by resolving customer complaints and/or issues, as well as give change and manager overrides to the cashiers."
good,"Great place to work, great people and great work-life balance"
good,This job was very fulfilling. The customer interaction and the personal knowledge gained about pharmaceuticals was wonderful. I enjoyed working in this field tremendously. I ran into a problem with harrassment at this job and filed several complaints that were not taken seriously and were not even looked in to. This forced me to leave when the harrassment got worse. I was not able to get another job in this field due to the laws changing where pharmacy technicians had to become licenced.
good,"The location I worked at was a fun place to be. We had fun events to balance the dullness of work. CVS is a company that values diversity. A typical day conists of greeting customers, register transactions and answering questions and the phone. I also worked in the photo department which meant I had to process film. It was a simple and easy process once I learned the steps. The hardest part of the job was beginning the day early, because in the early hours of the morning things move slow. By midday there are so many customers that you have to call for assistance."
good,"Pharmacy Associate. Cashier, entered patient's information and scripts in the computer, deleted scripts out of the computer, put medicines that were not picked up by patient on shelves, answered and operated multi-line phones, customer service, and returns. The management was very cheerful, willing to assist customers, willing to assist co-workers, positive, hardworking, and dependable. Co-workers were just as great to work with as the management. The hardest part of the job was when we got really busy and the customers would get impatient. I tried to always make the customers happy and satisfied. The most enjoyable part was working with the management,the fact that I was working in a medical environment, and learning new things about the medical field regarding medicine."
good,A typical day was fast paced . I learned excellent communication skills with co-workers as well as custtomers. Managment experienced a few problems. Some co-workers brought home problems to work overall everyone communicated well. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and providing them with what they needed!
good,"A typical day id a patient waiting for you. They depend on you fro a cup of tea, company and companionship. Help to get dressed, washed and in and out of bed. Personal toilet care and other personal care."
good,cvs is a great place to work. good people good supervisors. good benifits. unfortunatly due to tough economy i am being laid off.
good,-Help customers
good,Learned how to be effective and efficient on the phone. Management was very helpful in and out of training. Hardest part of the job were the escalated calls. Most enjoyable part of the job was when I had helped the customer solve their problem.
good,Wonderful place to work and advance in management positions
good,really enjoyed this place
good,I enjoyed my employment at CVS Pharmacy. My fellow co-workers were great people and I learned a lot about management in a public environment. I think the hardest part of working for this employer was management turn-over. We never knew who was going to be running the store I was employed at.
good,"My job is customer service, basically supplying product for tube feeding, ostomy, colostomy, tracheotomy and wound care patients. First thing in the morning I preview and place monthly orders before deadline to ensure next day delivery. Then I check voicemail, return calls and place orders for newly admited patients, patients running low on product or wholesale orders. I check faxes, make changes and place any necessary orders.I review packets and process necessary changes. I check email and answer any questions and place any needed orders. I fax inventory forms to facilities for the next days orders. I keep answering the phone throughout the day, taking changes and processing any necessary orders, calling next day orders in if after cut off. It is nice to know that I am meeting deadlines and getting scheduled orders out on time and new patient orders there by next day. The hardest part of my job is relying on the warehouse to ship the correct product and get it to the correct destination by the delivery date and keeping focused being sure not to miss anything due to multiple interuptions. Customer service reps work together to make sure orders are placed for each other in the event that someone is out for any reason."
good,Loved working there
good,I have learned everything I know about the pharmacy field from my on the job training. The training is great and I enjoyed having the ability to get my state certification through the company rather than going to school.
good,Cvs (customer valued service) pharmacy is a great place to work! I throughly enjoyed getting to know my co workers and my customers! The job requires a lot of customer care and attention while also careing for the store! I enjoyed my job working in the front store and i still take pride in still knowing how to do the job even though i have not worked there in over a year!! Wnderful company and place to work!
good,"my typical day at work was always busy from the first second you walked in ,the phones ,customers lined up.what I learned at CVS is to be patient and don't let stress eat you alive when I is very busy.and take 1 step at a time.my Pharmacy manager is a great man he taught me a lot.my co workers were very friendly people we were all family.the hardest part of the job was when everyone started to leave the company.what I loved about the job is we all made each other laugh,cry but we never lost our close connection or our love for the job and our patients."
good,"sell everyday items to customers, offered wide selection of merchandise"
good,"Not enough hours, always stressing about picking shifts at a different locations however Pay and benefits are good,In my opinion pharmacy  Technicians need at least 30 hours per week"
good,This place wasn’t really a job it was more of a internship. I’ve learn enough where if I were to come back I could work efficiently. I already have my certificate from my pharmacy career class and this place would be a great place if you were thinking about starting your pharmacy career. Hardest thing is probably dealing with rushes and customers and the most enjoyable thing is having the pharmacist and other pharmacy technicians helping you when ever you need
good,Fairly straightforward job. Not much flexibility in hours. Great for new grads and work life balance. Not much complexity in the cases you'll treat. Not too challenging or room for growth.
good,They actually played helpful rescan for more hope around the community thinkful for the employees helping each other good communication and management....
good,A nice job to have straight out of high school. it has good benefits. nothing really to hard that you cant handle. the staff are friendly. the staff are very helpful. my favorite part about working here is that i can get crossed trained for pharmacy.
good,"you have to be a quick learner in this environment to thrive.  the pay is not good compared to the amount you accomplish. its a high stress job that requires your full attention, if you dont have a good supporting cast with you. it makes the environment undesirable"
good,"I get into the store early to complete administrative duties as well before the store open to the  public.create a list of priorities . check through the schedule, drop money to the the bank. make sure the store is clean and shelf fill of items with update price.this discus with my team our week goal and the progress. Helped  my staff with any issue regarding customer service and make sure everybody is committed to work effectively .So  we came with strategy for increasing efficiency. During the day, keep in touch with clients, make sure they are satisfied. working at CVS helped me to realize the impact of a good customer service in this business.I like the flexible schedule and the management delegation style and I had really enjoyed  interacted with different people from different culture."
good,At times it could be a bit overwhelming and not fully staffed. Every day was extremely busy and sometimes a bit stressful. I like having a controllable busy day but that wasn't always the case.
good,Great people good work ethic . and  great City good pay.be on time coustmers are always right even if there wrong it's ur job. Manager /supervisor great don't get too many hrs weekends are busy.
good,Most management I've worked with are approachable and work with your schedule. They have full time and part-time positions available and are able to work at other CVs stores if you're looking for more hours.
good,"The hardest part about  working with this company is the lack of hour in recent years , there  is not enough time given within the day to accomplish work, however CVS has always had a great job work/ life balance"
good,pay is 15.50 other competitors pay more they offer bonuses twice a year attendance policy is very strict hours vary. full service cafeteria that service hot meals.
good,"I love working here and my manager is great. There is plenty of opportunities for advancement and relocation. The benefits are some of the best. I will have a total of 5 weeks off. Pro + floating days+ paid holidays"
good,This job has been great to have while obtaining my Bachelor's degree. The hours are relatively flexible and the management team is super fun and great to work with. I have enjoyed my time so far at CVS Pharmacy and am very grateful for all I have gained so far.
good,"Had a great store manager that was flexible with my required time off, but the district managers were hit or miss, and the yearly pay raises weren't sufficient. Any time the corporate headquarters could find a way to cut total store hours they would, making it harder to fun a shift with less people."
good,"I love my job at CVS I learned a lot from working Retail here. Within a year I was promoted to a shift leader, the only down side is you only 20-30 hours a week. This is great for someone looking for part time work."
good,I have enjoyed my time here I just am ready to move on to something new. The hours are great and they work with your schedule. I enjoy the other workers here.
good,Worked there for a while. Very fast paced at times depending on location and time of year. Can be very stressful when it comes to certain customer but it’s normal for retail.
good,"The company itself is a very good company to work for, although training and mentor ship is long and can be daunting. I would recommend this job to someone who is serious about their career and can take the time to learn and enjoy it. I would also say that it's best to have a way to get there in your own, training and mentoring is typically a long ways away in Texas and they would reimburse you."
good,A great place to work if you are full time. Great Benefits! This particular location has a great atmosphere because of the kindness and generosity the employees have.
good,When I first started with was only like 5 guys having 2 lanes and had to work 12 hours a day until the staff got larger. I started off as a loader and then later was educated to train on the cherry picker and then later controlled the sorter operator. If you show dedication to the job they will move you around to help them so you can help out in any location
good,Good work place but don't offer enough hours to work.  Only one shift lead during the day and even doing all work plus taking care of customers plus office work.
good,"Excellent company to build experience with! I have been with CVS for 3 years and I advanced so quickly! In my position, managers vary greatly but the 4 managers that I worked with were all wonderful and understanding and knew their jobs well."
good,"Customer service above all."
good,My coworkers and myself work really hard to make sure our goals are met and exceeded even if that means coming in early staying late or passing on taking a lunch break.
good,"The job requieres for you to be able to multitask be able to handle unhappy customers willing to learn to fix shelves, i pack out costemetics and facial care!"
good,"amazing company I worked for, not fast-paced, quality care is most important, management was really good, they were always there to help with anything."
good,"It was a good internship, I got paid and learned a lot. The coworker were nice and always willing to help you learn. This experience helped me learn a lot about being in a work environment."
good,"Most stores are often busy, especially during the flu season and insurance changes. If you like a fast-paced environment and can work efficiently under high pressure, then CVS might be right for you."
good,The people are friendly and greet each other everyday.  I love being able to serve people in my role with CVS. The work is very rewarding.  With two cafeterias. So you have more food options.
good,Huge company easy to get lost in the shuffle. Many levels of leadership which can sometimes complicate things. Strong focus on the pharmaceutical side of the business!
good,"A typical day at work is me starting at the production table to fill prescriptions for about 3 hours with my coworkers. While filling, I have to greet and help customers with whatever they need. Wether it be recommended products to use, selling them their prescriptions or inputting their new prescriptions from their doctors. When I'm done filling prescriptions I then pull prescriptions off the shelves that have been in the waiting bin for 2 weeks."
good,"CVS Health is great for people who desire discounts on food, beverages, and even home supplies. Also health and dental coverage is offered in this position."
good,"Great place to work in a retail environment.  There were new programs coming to play, such as pharmacist being able to immunize.  It a great place to learn and grow"
good,"Good job to work at if you don't have kids, pay well, great benefits, and room for advancement , take your breaks whenever you like, work is very easy once you learn it"
good,"this company is a decent company to work for, for the most part. the do give you the tools to be successful. the wages need to match the cost of living. management is good and fair.  I started at 10.50 per hour. it took me almost 5 years to move up to 14.00."
good,I loved working at fenly ocation but headquarters is a no for me. It’s like once i was forced to move i dealt with a lot of racism but at fenely location i felt loved and valued
good,"I enjoyed working with CVS, it had a great working environment, respectful co-workers and a kind manager. The hardest parts of the job were keeping a fast careful pace and remembering some of the stores ailes"
good,"The company treats you very well as far as health benefits, 401K, stock options, and vacation/sick time. However, the compensation they give is not usually enough to make a living on unless you work higher up in the company."
good,It was a fun job i learned a lot the people were nice and helpful to work with i got to help my managers or my co worker if they asked and customers were nice
good,"My time with CVS/Caremark has taught me two main things, that people are people, as varied and constant as the  stars in the sky and that you learn something new every day. The job itself takes some time to get used to - by that I mean simply that its a lot to learn, even with the 6 week paid training. Every call is different, each caller and their issue unique and presents its own challenges. Learning the ins and outs of the insurance plans makes helping the members a bit easier. The people that I worked with, from my fellow CCRs to the supervisors and managers are a wonderful group of people, always willing to lend a hand with support and learning. I would stay, but the travel is a bit tough for me. The traffic in Pittsburgh is the scariest part of this job!"
good,"My time at Caremark was only challenging because it was a work at home position. There was nothing to occupy my time or challenge me when there was downtime. The management, however was incredibly supportive and very encouraging. The company is an excellent company to work for."
good,This company is a great company its only problem was that I was underpaid for the work that I was producing. I would like to add that my manager was great and made the envioroment around us much easier to work.
good,the other staff are very kind and will go out of their way to help you if you need assistance and will not hesitate to refresh your memory or help you out with something if you need assistance while working.
good,"The company was a great place to work for if you enjoy fast paced and constantly having work / something to do! Excellent training materials and constant courses to keep the employees up to date. The down side is the pay rate for customer service / retail , in my opinion as a pharmacy Technician for CVS you dealt with a lot and had the stress and pressure of sometimes dealing with difficult customers! It is such a large company that you would think they would award or acknowledge the employees but unfortunately as an employee for CVS I constantly felt my hard work didn't matter to them ! As an employee I didn't feel appreciated!"
good,CVS Pharmacy is an overall good company to work for. The pharmacy provides hands on training that is very beneficial for a future career in the medical field.
good,"Great place to work. Great company. Great people. It gave me a sense of gratitude to work at things that make people enjoy better health. My co-workers are real good @ their roles in providing a good experience for customers. People, that you soon find out, care about the customer experience. CVS in my opinion is a great company; extremely organized, very well managed, and an overall ""Good"""
good,fun to learn here in all aspects of life and work. great teamwork. I have improved tremendously in customer service and multitasking. and I have improved greatly in my managing skills...
good,"A typical day was stressful and very fast-paced, but the pay and benefits were great.  I enjoyed my co-workers and supervisors; and I felt treated fairly."
good,"Management is very hands off, but always there to help with any issues.  There is flexibility in your daily schedule.  I would highly recommend working for this company."
good,"there was always something to do at the place, and the workers where always kind to others and the customers. The manager was kind and well with others as well. The hours there was fair and simple for me to work with but I was with a school program so I couldn't work there long."
good,"I worked at a CVS that was in a neighborhood of a lot of elderly people. I love working with elderly people and I learned that patience with them gets you a long way and you're able to build a great relationship through it. Management was good, never really had problems, just was great to work with. The hardest part of the job was  dealing with lack of coworkers, but my most enjoyable part was answering that drive thru lane, getting to the big window and greeting whomever with a smile and best customer service I could!"
good,I worked for cvs for 12 years. The company trained me on everything I needed to know and also paid for the national test once. Overall cvs is a good company to work for. I was able to travel and relocate to where ever I was moving too.
good,"CVS is a great place to work . Usually speak to all your teammates and prepare/clean desk before taking calls.Since the call center set up into teams . We were able to IM/skpye each others funny messages throughout our shift to make work go by smooth."
good,"Its an extremely fast paced work"
good,"I was at CVS for a little over a year. While working in a pharmacy can be very stressful the people who I worked with made it worth every second. If the day gets a little too much to handle we always used to say, ""the day HAS to end at some point!"""
good,"Highly stressful job, working under intense time constraints. Helping and assisting pharmacist with daily duties of a pharmacy technician's job. Helping customers with questions about insurance and medical information needs."
good,"Many in this line of work would agree that as a technician you do everything a Pharmacist does except verify. that mean I, stocked, date check, filled medication, and dealt with patient."
good,Good work place but little room for advancement once you hit lead tech. overall fun place to work.... nice customers (most of the time). if the pay was higher it was be an awesome place to work.
good,"I love working for Omnicare/CVS! I work on the front end & I have a manager that goes above and beyond for her employees.  The work can sometimes be stressful & overwhelming (we are long term care), but we all work together as a team to get it done. We had some technicians that were causing issues, but now that they are gone, everything has fallen into place.  We have become a great team!"
good,"Really awesome job . Worked 3rd shift as a supervisor ,you get plenty of overtime good pay , flexible hours , great  customers , I got promoted from cashier to supervisor within months"
good,"Daily job activities are quite fast-paced, as there are normally only 2-3 employees on the clock at any given time. Each team member is expected contribute to the operation of the store, mostly through directed daily tasks. These need to be completed in conjunction with customer service, so it's heavy in multitasking."
good,Work life balance. Good management and I learned a lot of things here. Good work culture. Used new technologies in this project and it is a fast paced Agile project.
good,Basic retail pharmacy practices. Receiving and filling valid prescriptions based on physician orders. Interacting with patients on a profession and personal level to create a relationship with our pharmacy and with their families. Maintaining proper inventory level to insure medication in stock and medication balance on hand remained correct.

good,"Omnicare was an awesome place to work, literally only left because I wanted to be able to move up. Manager there was great. I enjoyed my coworkers company and we all worked well as a team."
good,Home Infusion part of the job was wonderful - loved the clients. Assignments depended on care plan and infusion + nursing service required. Lots of client and family teaching involved. The hardest part of the job was that I had a toddler at the time and it was difficult putting in the long hours. Not a position recommended for a single parent. But many aspects of the job and duties were fun and rewarding.
good,"I floated so workplace culture was slightly different, but overall good.  Management was great.  The hardest part of the job was indeed the travel.  My fellow co-workers and the customers were the most enjoyable part of my job."

good,it has been great working with CVS. There are leraning opportunities everyday and most people are willing to teach you. Only reason I am considering leaving the company is because I am not making enough hours during the week and I am needing a full time career

good,"Exciting been at work everyday to assist my Sales Representatives and coworkers talking to doctor offices to help get Patients on medication as needed."
good,Good company to work for a lot of calls. The training takes long time but is very good. they do have people that will help you if needed. At this job you will need a thick skin because the members can be very rude and mean.
good,"Fast paced work environment at a busy location for a small pharmacy. Averaging roughly 2,000 scripts per week and broad work spectrum and responsibilities."
good,I worked as a pharmacy technician for a couple of months and I felt so stressed all the time. I wanted to talk back to customers so much because they were rude. I wasn't paid that much for having a license and I wasn't being put at my full potential. Hopefully it gets better.
good,"I would contact customers reminding them about their medications. "
good,"My position is responsible for gathering and entering information related to the payer status of patients from the facility, or from the responsible party. Ensure that census paperwork is received from the Nursing facility. Ensure that the census is entered into the operating system accurately and is valid coverage. Review paperwork and verify completeness and of intake process focusing on payer verification and selection."
good,CVS also had great people and I made decent money.  I loved the tasks I did everyday and I kept very busy.  However the pharmacy business became something that I started to loose faith in so I had to move on.

good,"A typical day in this pharmacy is quite hectic and usually short on allotted hours for staff, but has allowed us to gain a serious sense of teamwork and a good work ethic."
good,"I started in my position without any experience or certification. Within a year my manager trained me in all areas of the pharmacy and encouraged me to obtain a national certification. Co-workers as well as management, at all levels, were supportive and available for questions and as a resource. Now almost four years with the company, I could not be more thankful for the doors the company has opened for my future. A normal day in the pharmacy is hectic, requires prioritizing, routine, adaptable, and only completed successfully with good team work. The most enjoyable part of the job, for me, is to fix/resolve/complete a task or issue that a customer was not able to fulfill themselves. A challenge for myself was completed and my work aided in a better experience for someone else."
good,co workers make the day go by faster and there are always fun activities going on to make the work place an easy going environment. not very long hours and management is very respectable
good,This company is a great for work life balance. I have been here for 1 year and some months and it has been a great experience. I have learned a lot about data management and how important the performance tuning in any industry related ti health care.
good,"I always enjoy working with my fellow co-workers and we are always able to work through problems in case one does arise. I have gotten to know the patients on a personal level and able to help them with anything that they need talking to insurance companies or any other issue that they would have. Sometimes it can get a little fast paced and a little stressful however, you will have that in any retail setting"

good,"As an ex-tern i was able to build experience and skill in the pharmacy. I have the basic knowledge of working in a medical setting, and a step ahead in medical studies."
good,CVS is driven to be the best healthcare organization in the world. The workplace is professional and efficient. Most workgroups are smaller manageable teams that work cross functionally to complete tasks.
good,"This is my first pharmacy technician job, but with that being said this has driven me to continue onto this career path! CVS offers a lot of advancement within the company. So that was a no brainier for me."
good,"Although tasks were simple, there was always a feeling of being behind. I found it easy to excel when i wanted to which was only half of the time i spent there. My time working there was divided by six locations, consequently making my scheduled very confusing. Co-workers shared with me that they too had erratic schedules due to a shared feeling of under-staffing combined with insufficient compensation."
good,"The start of the day is usually pretty slow and quiet, which gives an opportunity to work on other things in the store such as go backs and cleaning. If the day is slow you have other jobs to do besides cashier. It will get busy at certain hours and before/during holidays."
good,"Taking care of patients in pharmacy and on the floor. Putting away medicine and all other products. Learned alot about a big corporation and all the rules and regulations. Co workers are great! Hardest part is working with ordering issues and issues with prescriptions."

good,"The work environment at CVS Pharmacy was one of ease, as many of the employees are friendly and welcoming to the customers. A few less welcoming employees would sometimes make the workplace feel a bit tense. Most days, there were no problems to report or any complaints to be had. Overall, I feel that it was a positive experience."
good,"Provided members with generic prescriptions by answering inbound calls. "
good,A typical day at work i dealt with a lot of different emotions from happy to sad. My co workers were awesome and were great team players. The hardest part of my job was not being able to help a patient with exactly what they needed only because it wasn't in my job description.
good,"I love getting experience in this environment , and getting to know the ins and outs of the pharmacy and the daily task that are needed to fulfill a good work environment."
good,"Every Tuesday is a good day for me. On that day we receive the weekly order from Cardinal. It is good because its a good chance to organize shelves. Also, because it is a big order, we have to do a lot of physical workout to finish it at the same day. Therefore, it is a good work out for me. We allow to wear jeans at that day too."
good,Engaging place to work that allows for a special intricate mindset that loves to work with others and know how to be selfless at all times. Emphasizing the customer experience is the key.

good,I enjoy warehouse work the mental and physical challenges being on the move. I learned everything as I moved to different departments we all had the chance to be trained. I was taught to use Excel enter data how to do research dive a cherry picker and double and single jack. I loved our management worked and communicated with each one they were awesome. my co workers were hard working at times some that whined but beyond that we would try to encourage each other to get the job done and laugh sing along the way. The hardest part of the job is when overtime kicked in it could go for months 12 hour days you have to stay focused remember everyone is tired not just you and keep that smile even if it felt like I could not take one more step. I loved the people and worked hard at getting every ones first name some one was going to make you smile. Communication is everything a positive attitude carries you far safety is every ones responsibility.
good,Job was met with strenuous amounts of responsibility and expectation to serve. Work load was almost always too much to handle per person but you were always surrounded by people experiencing the same thing so there was support. High stress job that required a lot of attention to detail while juggling multiple tasks. In the end the reward of completing the many jobs set ahead daily was worth the stress.
good,Great place to work but low compensation. Good place to work management was excellent. They care about the employees but you need more money for people to stay.
good,The few years I worked at CVS were enjoyable. Super great  coworkers. Truly a great company. The pay I received back then was good as well.
good,"Mandatory overtime is excessive, but if that's what you like, then this is the job for you."
good,I enjoyed working for CVS. It is a great place to work if you are looking for job growth.

I was also responsible for writing the weekly schedule and submitting the weekly payroll.
good,"Support people who support people..."
good,"Excellent place to work with minimal supervision and promotion potential. The benefits were great. There were excellent staff members, who took pride in their work."
good,"Working as an employee at CVS Pharmacy is a very different experience. You build a lot of skill sets such as the pharmacy roles that include inventory management, prescription date input, preparation, and dispensing. Along with that you learn great customer service skills and learning the pharmacy business. Working at this place of employments is a great experience and you work with a diverse group of individuals which is a very positive factor when working for this company. The hardest part about working at CVS is never having something to do, there is always something for a CVS employee to be working on, which makes it a fun and fast pace environment. The greatest part about working here is building relations with customers and providing great service and making a change to a customers day by just assisting them and making the smoothest transaction for them."
good,"Overall this was a good place to work, the managers I had were concerned with helping me achieve my daily goals and cared about me as a person. The environment was clean, secure and safe. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people."
good,"When working as a pharmacist in a high volume retain pharmacy anywhere its going to be stressful. But when you have good technicians who know there job, it is a bit easier. The comp and benefits were probably best in industry"
good,"Learning Environment. Awesome management, very helpful. Co-workers are very friendly and everyone works as a tea . Long hours with short breaks."
good,"The typical work day is busy, not much down time. I've learned to type prescriptions, insurance, and effectively help customers. We have a great staff and we work as a team. The hardest part of the job is disgruntled customer's. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customer's get healthier and happier."
good,In my experience with cvs pharmacy I have the opportunity to work with technicians of different back grounds and as a leader I have found that by bringing together each others strengths we are able to combat any weakness that stands out and make a strong team. In regards to customer service I have had the opportunity to resolve many problems that have risen and step in to help other co workers that were having a difficult time trying to communicate with customers in regards to service or there prescription processing. I enjoy being a pharmacy technician
good,"The Company, in general, is a good company. The benefits are great but the compensation and advancement is difficult. "
good,"Just your average retail pharmacy setting. The one in Oak Ridge has very good staff."
good,I learned alot from this company worked as a night rph staff rph and eventually a pharmacist in charge. It was a truly rewarding experience with a great opportunity to advance.
good,very strong management that kept the employees up to date on the latest regulations and health industry standards. Great oppurtunities within while growing in role
good,"Managed to deal with insurance companies and dispense medications to patients. Worked closely with coworkers on a daily basis, helping others as needed to perform tasks correctly."
good,"CVS was my first experience working in retail pharmacy. I enjoyed utilizing the education and training I got received in Pharmacy Technician school. The most difficult part of working for CVS was being trained in every aspect of retail pharmacy. The store that I worked in was always very busy. I was not adequately trained in resolving third party insurance issues. I believe that is a vital part of being an effective retail pharmacy technician. The management for the CVS I worked for was a bit disconnected. The pharmacy manager would over see the pharmacy, but the General Manager loved to override whatever the pharmacy manager had decided. It made working in that store challenging, but aside from that I enjoyed working in that store. The best part of working in retail was seeing the smiles from the elderly. More than half of our clients in that store were the elderly and retired."
good,"Everyday I cashier, and work with many customers. I also type up prescriptions, bill insurance and do other tasks on the pharmacy computers. I work in the busiest pharmacy in my county, and also in our district. The hardest part of my job is telling customers that their prescriptions aren't ready. Because we are very busy, we are also almost always behind schedule. It is not because we are slow, but because we have so many prescriptions to fill everyday. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing my customers by name, and working in a fast paced environment. I am never bored, there is always another task to be done. I would always rather be busy than bored. I get along with all of my coworkers, and enjoy things best when everyone works together and no one is complaining.  I think that the management at CVS is great. My job is very flexible and I feel respected by my bosses."
good,my co worker are nice to work with you have the opportunity to advance with then the company. you can earn trophy at the end of year for job well done which Is nice to be reconized for good job.
good,"- Teamwork at our place makes work different.  We all help each other and provide our best patient care."
good,"CVS is very customer service oriented. Between cleaning, unloading, stocking, checking vendors in, it was also a very laid back environment to work it. Most everyone got along and made the work easier even if it was run on a skeleton crew."
good,"My experience was at a relatively high-volume store. Typical days involved filling approximately 450 scripts, with all the usual ups and downs associated with retail pharmacy. The highlight of my days were the positive interactions and relationships we were able to build with most of our patients. Having good co-workers is always a plus. Management was supportive, but as in all areas there were always targets and goals that were often counter-productive to real-world performance. CVS has many different programs, tools, and training for all of their employees - there is always a resource available, and management was always willing to help."
good,I would go in greet everyone and get my day started . Everyday is a new day to learn new things. I love the way how everything was run in the pharmacy everything went smoothly with my managers and co workers . The hardest part of the job is not being able to completely finish my conversations with my costumers but I do love helping them and making them smile before they leave .
good,"A typical day at work is coming and just taking in new prescriptions, filling them and talking to patients about their medications. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the patients and knowing that we are really helping them out. When they acknowledge how much we have helped or how much we have made their day easier just lets me know im doing my job and making a difference. The hardest part of my job is just working with people who are sometimes at their worst. they are coming in right after surgery, or right after losing a loved one, or they just don't feel good and they are taking every thing out on you. Its hard not because they are actually doing that but its hard because we know they don't mean it but are doing it anyways. I love my coworkers. We seem to get along great and we work great together always helping each other out or even suggesting ways we could do things better."
good,"CVS Pharmacy was a great opportunity to learn the ins and outs of a retail corporation, both on the corporate level as well as the retail management and operations level."
good,"Depending on if it was the summer or during the school year, a typical work day was usually 6-8 hours long. I learned how to measure pharmaceutical products, run the pick up and drop off stations, as well as deal with insurance companies. The management was amazing to work with along with my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was balancing it with my school work during the semester. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and measuring out different pharmaceutical prescriptions."
good,This company is an enjoyable workplace that understands the importance of diversity. It provided education and the ability to advance in the company.
good,"Fast pace environment, neat and clean place. Helpful workers. and good pay and benefits. I love pulling orders for this company."

good,the managers make sure you fully understand the work that your doing and they making where it's fun and you want to learn it
good,"Took prescription orders to be delivered by mail and helped patients better understand their medication along with insurance. I learned different specialty drugs and different types of insurance and insurance plans. Management was moderate; they were friendly, however, laying people off without notice (until after their shift). All of my coworkers were knowledgeable and very helpful. Great teamwork! The hardest part of the job was trying to accomplish making a sick person happy and satisfied, however it was manageable and I was able to perform my job accurately and efficiently. The most enjoyable part of my job was also the hardest part because the results of making a sick person feel better was my job and it was very rewarding."
good,"Customer oriented business, problem is that unless you are in good graces with management, your hours will suck. Worked with 5 store managers and its the same story over and over and over. All in All, Great company"
good,"A Typical day at work would be Attending the Cash Register when needed, satisfying customers with any help they requested and returning items back on their shelves where they belong. I learn how to organize, do inventory and refills Hallmark cards. Management was professional, decent and firmly directive. My Co workers were Excellent independent workers, amazing team workers and very outgoing. The hardest part of the job was figuring out a way to prevent some customers from stealing a very expensive item in the most calmed and mannered way. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to see a smiley face on customers by making them feel welcomed and appreciated for their visit and purchases in the store."
good,"I enjoyed my 13+ years with Caremark Pharmacy, I learned many things and was given the opportunity to train others in my knowledge which I really loved.  I had great co workers and would have loved to had 13 more years with Caremark."
good,Very good colleagues. Learning environment and very busy pharmacy.
good,a high coordination with colleauges and supervisors for on time performance of flights and with a very good passenger service
good,"We basically went in and got the job done. I  learned that you can work as fast as you can but it wont always satisfy others, but its still hard work. My supervisor was awesome! When something was needed she helped out as much as she could. The people I worked with were nice as well, there were issues going on already when I first started but I was never part of it. The awesome part of it was when I had dump pallets. They were easy to work and also faster to work."
good,Accept and verify written and electronic prescriptions. Input prescriptions and all customer information into computer to be filled. Bill 3rd party insurance and resolve conflicts if needed.  Pull stock medication to be filled. Fill and label prescriptions to be verified by the pharmacist. Assist customers at the registers when they come in to pick up their medication. Wring up customers for their prescriptions and other items. Resolve non-clinical questions for customers. My co-workers are excellent people to work with. Unfortunately its a large retail chain and employees are overloaded and underpaid.

good,"•	Answered phones, took messages, and transferred calls to appropriate individuals "
good,I love working at CVS/ Pharmacy. The managers are great and will work with your schedule.
good,"A typical day would include working with doctors and patients to get their medication in a timely fashion. We would fill prescriptions, work with insurance companies and also with customers. I would be the pharmacist's right hand man. I learned how to deal with patients, doctors and insurance companies about prescription medication. The management was great and helpful to me each day. My co-workers would work hard to get people's prescriptions taken care of. The hardest part of the job was dealing with insurance companies. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people get healthy."
good,"I enrolled people in drug and advantage plans, and answered questions about billing, The supervisors were very nice but they were under pressure to keep people on schedule, which meant if breaks were missed, the csr had no break."
good,In this job I learned a variety of clerical and customer service skills. I liked the work environment but I had difficulty with management
good,My colleagues make my job worthwhile. They are a great group of people. The pay is not enough for all the job responsibilities.
good,"A typical day at Omnicare started with checking messages on the call service than turning on the phone for incoming calls,  In between the abundance of calls to be transferred to the billing processors I had to assist in preparing the billing documents to be sent out to clients. My manager always had a joke to tell and keep us smiling and feeling like a family.Working with a team always taught me that regardless of personality differences, that my goal was to do my part.  My co-workers and I worked well together to get our job done.  The hardest part was to make sure bills went out on a timely manner.  I enjoyed the work I did and made sure that, at the end of the day it was a good well done."

good,"Every day was different but the same. I truly enjoyed what I did. The job was always challenging. I feel that I made a difference in our patients lives. I was able to earn my pharmacy technician licenses through the company. When there was down times I made sure that I found things to do as in filing, helping with he warehouse staff and assisting others when they needed assistance. The most difficult part of my job was when we became extremely busy and making sure we met each and every deadline for our patient. The best part of my job was getting to know our referral sources and our patients on a one to one basis."
good,"great place that works with you're schedule, great co-workers if you work there long enough it becomes a family environment. great customer service experience."
good,"Started out being a cashier and went up to supervisor for the photo lab had a  lot od duties like making photos, cashier , reports. My co workers where really nice and very helpful we had a amazing team, management was he most professional.  I enjoyed this place of work a lot, learned a lot and met some great people."
good,"Great coworkers, upper levels of management open to feedback."
good,"A typical day at work would include answering inbound customer calls regarding prescription benefits and coverage. In between calls I am getting mail correspondence ready for imaging, verifying forwarding address, as well as some data entry and 10 key. Management as well as the other co-workers are all very easy to get along with and communicate with. Everyone is willing to help out. The hardest part of the job would be having to take calls from members who are struggling with the cost of their medications and knowing there isn't much I can do to assist. On the other hand the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to show the members I care."
good,"The pharmacy is always busy, and  there is never a dull moment. Multitasking is a necessity for all people on duty.

good,"work on assigned projects, run cashier, lab and help customers find what they need"
good,Working at CVS I have learned to be a fast thinker and multi-tasker. Everyday is a very busy day with prescriptions constantly flowing in the door. Management does a well job putting employees where they'll exceed the most and be essential to the work flow. My co-workers helped me get better at my job and welcomed me with open arms. I enjoy helping customers get their medication and giving them any advice that could benefit them. 
good,"I would run the customer service desk, stock, and clean each shift. I learned how to become a keyholder/ supervisor. Management was also wonderful. They made sure to treat their employees with respect but at the same time be stern when needed. The co-workers were all very nice and welcoming to new employees. The hardest part of the day was when I was doing my floor responsibilities and also trying to run the customer service desk myself. I thought everything about the job was very enjoyable"
good,Great place while working there but had issues with scheduling where there were too many people making the schedule so when i put in my 2 weeks notice for school i would still be on the scheduled.  Most of the people were great to work with and a pleasure to work with. 
good,"Busy most of the time, learend more about cash resgiser. The management was great everyone pitch in to help me learn, co-workers were great to work with. Hardest part was finding what else to do during work hours i always finished early with my work in the store clean and sharp. The best part about my job was seeing customers injoy their trip there"
good,"From an employee's stand-point, CVS/Pharmacy has changed dramatically within the last decade.  A typical work day involves a high amount of communication within the pharmacy as well as with costumers.  At times the workload can be overwhelming, especially at a 24-hour store.  The hardest part about this job is insurance processing.  The most enjoyable part of this job is working closely with other co-workers."
good,Overall CVS is a good workplace. I would like to work more one on one with patients and work less like a fast food chain. 
good,Working extremely hard to satisfy the customers needs and the company. I've learned so much working for the company like working together as one and learning more skills along the way.And if you make the customers happy you make the company happy.Management was very professional.The hardest part working as a pharmacy technician was well really nothing at all.I really enjoyed that the company was family first.
good,My day at work consist of being the cashier and helping customers find items in the store. I do have good co-workers. I've learned that even on your roughest days you can make the best out of it no matter what kind of customers you get. The management at work I would say needs to really be managed by the store manager and treat everyone the same. The most enjoyable part of my day is seeing my regular customer and having that friendly relaionship tht always makes them feel like home where they want to return.
good,"• Responsible for daily transactions and daily receipt balances"
good,"a typical day at work involves hard work, working together with co workers to ensure customers are well taken care of. Working at Caremark I learned how to provide excellent customer service.

good,"A typical day at work finds me running from drive-thru window, to pick up counter, to production- very hectic at times. I have learned to prioritize. Management is great and are a very powerful and wonderful part of CVS. Co workers can be moody and some even lazy so it is important to stand up for yourself. The hardest part of the job is depending on others to do their job so that you can effectively do yours. The best part is pay, management ease, and the company has pretty good values."
good,Working with CVS Pharmacy has been rewarding and challenging! I work Full Time and also float between other stores when needed. I have learned many aspects of my job title and enjoy working with a team!
good,"The most important thing I learned is that every person we deal with on a daily basis has to be dealt with differently. The driving force for an employee, customer, peer or supervisor will not necessarily be the same each time. The most enjoyable part of CVS was the team that I built over the years and the client base that I got to see every day."
good,"A typical day at work consists of, stocking, and alot of inventory."
good,great team work.
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company. I had three different positions here and the last one had a wierd shift schedule that made life outside of work very challenging. You had three shifts to work per week. You would open, close and have a mid day shift. Other than that shift, I had no problems and would recommend this company to anyone looking for work."
good,I've learned alot about Phamaceuticals at CVS/Pharmacy. Its very busy and fast paced.
good,"Great place to work, and very neat. Good management, and you can also learn while working at the same time."
good,I really enjoy being a pharmacy technician and the people I work with and the relationships that I have built with them over the years.
good,"i was guide to my work area and explain about some of the duties around the pharmacy, co-worker were very help full and patient, my director very professional and open person to talk, i did not have a hard moment, i had a good teacher show us every thing we need. the most enjoyable time was work doing compound and work in the IV room."
good,A typical day at work consist of being very productive and finishing all assigned tasks.
good,"At CVS Caremark i will about 30 calls a day. I will help CVS employees with their laptop/desktop problems. for example, if a user was locked out from their computer and needed thier account unlocked i will unlock their account by going into a active directory, look at their profile and see thier account to get into thier computer is locked. i will unlock the account for the user and he/she will be allset to get into their laptop/desktop. i also installed software to users computer. fimilar with Damware remote."
good,"Working at CVS was my right out of high school job. I worked at 2 different locations. Where you work is depending on how you like the job. One store I LOVED, I would go back in a heartbeat. The other store was a nightmare, the supervisor was horrible. It's retail, what else can you say?"
good,Manager's from other stores will help you out if asked. The Pharmacy is the primary focus of CVS so I spent a majority of my time help out the pharmacy instead of being on the sales floor.
good,I love working right omnicare! You had a lot time to get to work done and everyone was I happy To help you out! I made a lot of friends and we Good laugh and joke with out or Coworker ! I miss working there
good,Working at CVS was very easy and I was able to change my schedule to better suit my workload with school at the time. I learned the foundational aspects of working retail during my time there.
good,"As a store manager there is a lot involved. At any given time you may be the only one in the store on the retail side. When this occurs you will need a stand by plan to be sure all still gets done. "
good,"Great place to work for"
good,Great pay... even tho we should get hazardous pay. Customers are not nice and talk and threaten you with no results in anything. They will call Corp and give bad reviews for the smallest stuff and we get in trouble for it. Smh
good,CVS is one of the best overall companies that I have ever worked for. I only moved on because I was offered an opportunity to be at store manager else where.
good,As a Pharmacy tech I have loved getting to know customers & managers are very understanding during my times of need.I only wish crop was understanding
good,"You will love what CVS offers to its customers, making sure that clear understanding follows all prescriptions, the mail service is great when you are unable to travel and special mail service for items that need to stay in the refrigerator."
good,"Working at CVS allowed me to expand my retail experience and connection with assisting customers with their needs. I have learned how to handle cash efficiently with money gram, and learn the basics of printing photos at the photo center. On a day to day basis I am working the front store, assisting customers on the sales floor, stocking inventory or shelving products from the delivery truck. I manage my time while I work with stocking CVS's products while maintaining my goals of upholding job duties as a CVS retail associate."
good,"My job was 10x easier because i had the best manager. I was able to work my way up quickly, and also through the company became a registered pharmacy technician."
good,One of the things I enjoyed most about CVS is knowing exactly what was expected of me.  There were certain tasks that had to be done on certain days of the week which made planning my work day very easy for me and my team.  This scheduling allowed me room for planning team building activities and implement incentives to keep the energy up in what may seem like a mundane work environment.
good,I was a Pharmacy intern here and really enjoyed working in the pharmacy with other staff members. I learned many managements skills that helped me in other work places.
good,"I loved my coworkers and manager! They were the sweetest people, and especially as a student they were so kind to the idea of me having to go to school and work. They were really good about fitting my schedule to my needs."
good,"Easy place to work, pretty easy interview.. Cvs management was ok when I worked there, however it’s very different now. They have a new district manager that is very biased and seems like she gets stressed easily. Now that she has started, they don’t pay as much for people now for some reason and cut hours at random. They have to start majority of people off at the bare minimum and only may be able to pay a dollar or so more if you have decades of experience."
good,I really enjoyed working here however I did not like being alone in a room with no windows. I realized I need to work closely with an interdisciplinary team and have mentors nearby.
good,"Customer service is the main priority for CVS, need to maintain a 50/50 balance prioritizing customer service and tasking. Fast motivating learning pace and working well with others."
good,"It was a delightful experience, the learning curve was great. the best arena to develop your skills vertically and horizontally. Miss the place still."
good,"Maybe its just the location but the environment and people there are very friendly and great to work with. Recommend working with cvs, they treat you the way you deserve to be treated"
good,"Preformed all duties of the pharmacist-pharmacist in charge, managed 10 employees, reported to my supervisor on store performance and customer satisfaction and new and up coming promotions/company goals,Hardest part of the job was balancing pharmacy manager and changing company goals with daily,weekly,monthly reports."
good,"You work hard and go home,I have learn A lot from CVS,U Can be cross Train for just about any job U want to try,I have to say Management do try to do there best to work with u,Culture is welcome at CVS,They will do what they can to Help U on your way,The Hardest part of the Job is keeping up with the Demand,Very fast pase ,But all so know your Helping People"
good,Awesome place to work. Stay busy management is there to help also flexible in the hours that you work and really good about vacation overall I would recommend working here
good,"I was working for a Dept that was a dispatched call center 95% inbound calls and 5% outbound calls,for PDP under Medicare, paid Training for about 5 weeks or more then certified  then thrown into the fire ( receive calls)the open enrollment dates are extremely busy and possible overtime will be available. The schedule will vary the have whats called a bid schedule based on you overall performance of attendance and scores of calls you will be rated a number on many employees and the schedule will be selected on what you selection of the all the options you want and so on i was also attending college at the time so was very flexible best time to apply is during the summer, Location where I worked was on 2700 Frye Rd this location has great security and has cafeteria where you make  purchase,"
good,"With the on the job training opportunity and trainee program, I've adequately been prepared to fullfil my duties as a fully licensed Pharmacy Technician"
good,Good training and trainers. Very hands on and answers all questions when needed. When you need help on phone calls they are there right away to assist you. Awesome leadership there.
good,I found the challenge of learning the process and ins and outs of the pharmacy and being an important role in that as pharmacy tech rewarding. The general store is welk designed and organized to continue the health and beauty needs for customers as well.
good,I love work at CVS but the hours are inconsistent and I was hired full time and working part time but I love working there all the people are so nice and its fast paced just how I like it.
good,"The location I was at made work very fun to be around. They make sure that we were able help and teach one another. I never had an issue about scheduling because they made it very flexible and try to accommodate everyone needs, but still was able to satisfy business needs."
good,"management at my location was great. they tended o my needs, and helpful in anything I needed. very friendly workplace, we always helped one another if needed."
good,CVS is making huge strides in providing growing opportunities for their employees. They make it a priority to ensure that you are equipped with the skills and experiences to moving up within your position and within the company.
good,"I worked at CVS pharmacy. It was a great working environment if you like fast pace and busy work. There was always something new to learn every day. The only con i have is that it can get very stressful sometimes, and with stress coworkers can be a bit moody."
good,Any day at CVS was busy. Always something extra to do for management and corporate. Checking in vendors for inventory control. Cashier and CSR very important
good,Productive and fun place to work. Opportunity to learn new things to facilitate in disease prevention and health promotion. Opportunity is fair at CVS
good,Although there were a lot of online modules that you had to complete every month the work environment was great! whenever you had a question there was not a person there who wouldn't help you. The pay could have been more since those in the hospital setting get a couple more dollars an hour the work was great! I always walked into work happy and with a mindset that I may learn something new today!
good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo, muy limpio y aseado el lugar de trabajo, y en general muy buenas condiciones laborales."
good,CVS is a fast growing company who offers a competitive wage and benefits.  Communication could be a little better and the HR department needs improvement.
good,I enjoyed my time at CVS went through a lot of managers in pharmacy and store. We had a minor tech problem as most were specialized in one or two areas of pharmacy except for 1 who could do it all.
good,Working at a pharmacy was great. At least the one I worked at. The people here always provided food and had fun conversations which made work fun. I really enjoyed working as a pharmacy technician.
good,My home store along with the many I've filled in for calls in or when scheduled have been at a high paced and steady pharmacy. All pharmacies doing approximately 600+ prescriptions a day; with each patient varying in race and gender. I feel as if they do under pay the technicians for the amount of work that is to be expected of them but at the same time that's also a pro towards CVS because each technician has to be well-rounded and knowledgeable of their surroundings in order to keep up with store expectations and standards.
good,Relaxing environment that can get hectic when busy days occur. It's room to grow. Very low turn over rate. Definitely a good company to grow with over the years
good,Working in the store can be ok if you have the right coworkers but it's very demanding and stressful.   There's always new programs put in place that increase the workload while they decrease hours which makes everything harder.
good,Depending on store and location team work is amazing and pay is very good. You are rewarded for your good work and they are very flexible with personal life.
good,well organize welcoming staff and helpful management always ready to help with any questions stress free environment and also balanced out my life with wore very well

The environment was a call center to receive inbound calls and provide substantial information in assisting customers.  Knowledge of "
good,"travel to workplace sometimes it was over 1 hour of travel time "
good,Great job with good advancement and benefits but mediocre pay. Good work life balance and continually keeps employees informed throughout the advancement of the company.
good,"It was my first job in US and they were nice to me teaching everything. Very helpful, nice group. It could have been a challenging without their help to manage my graduate studies and work without their help."
good,"Work here is fast paced and stressful, but worth it for the schedule and benefits. I enjoy working with patients on a daily basis. I can only speak for my district, but I'm blessed to have wonderful management."
good,CVS is a great company to work for. It has given me and alot of other people I know opportunities for advancement in and out of retail pharmacy. Hours of operation make it difficult to get some things done.
good,"I learned a great deal about benefits management, particularly as it pertains to Medicare Part D. It is a very supportive workplace with a great work/life balance, opportunity for advancement, and good management."
good,Very pleasant atmosphere great teammates that you can rely on to give you a helping hand when needed.Very well training facility to help their technicians to strive. Pharmacist are very appreciated when they can take a moment with their busy day being behind the phones all day with doctors to help out the technicians with the work load if it becomes a bit too heavy to make the delivery go out on time. I learned all of my skills through Omnicare without them i would have not been even half the technician that I am today.
good,"CVS Pharmacy is a great place to work. Everyone smiles, and they are very friendly. They are very efficient, and very knowledgeable of what they do..."
good,It was a great job to have when I was younger! I took the job while I was still attending High School and I am grateful for the experience it gave me.
good,"Overall. this is definitely a good job. Although I worked only part-time, there were still insurance options for me, and I would definitely say the pay was fair. A typical day at work usually has a busy period or two, but is typically relatively relaxed. Management is friendly, and easily accessible for questions. A definite bonus is the ability to meet new people, but people can certainly push your buttons. I liked that I learned/ improved on conflict resolution."
good,"The managers are awesome and understanding. Unfortunately, a lot of the jobs take you away from the register and majority of the time, it is just you and a manager. So really, just you. It is hard to complete all tasks given because of the sheer quantity. Great pay though!"
good,Constantly going through new employees due to the high work demand. I believe if you can make it in this work setting then the sky is no longer your limit.
good,A delight to work with the employees. Always meeting new customers and talking with them and getting to know them. You may work every holiday.  Not feasible if you have children.

good,"Great company giving back to the society in every aspects for a better health."
good,"I truly admired working for this company. As employees the core values were demonstrated. I admired how monthly meetings took place with each employee providing examples on what they can do better to assist the department. Also, employees have a voice; being able to complete yearly surveys on the managers performance."
good,"A typical day at work would start off by typing in prescriptions that people either bring in or are sent in by the doctor. We also need to prepare those prescriptions for the patient/customer before they arrive to pick it up. While preparing a prescription, one might also need to help other patients at the same time, whether it may be on the phone or even at the drop off window. It is important to be able to multitask for this job because many times, you are needed in more places than one at a time. What makes this job enjoyable is by always having a positive attitude and getting along with my coworkers. We are all always able to laugh at things together when things are getting rough around the store."
good,"When my job first started at CVS the work environment was good and people that i worked with got along and we worked great together. "

good,"I highly recommend this job position if you are someone who enjoys customer service and  is looking for a fast paced working atmosphere. A typical day at work for me is operating the cash register, printing out labels for medications, taking refill requests, and filling medications.  I learned how to navigate through CVS database to do a multitude of tasks such as: look up patient prescription history, edit prescriptions, refill a medication, etc. Co-workers are great as they are always eager to help with any questions I may have. The joy I get from customer satisfaction makes working at CVS a breeze.  The workload of filling prescriptions in a certain time strain can be overwhelming at times.  As long as you manage your time and do your job accurately , then it will not be a difficult task. Overall this job is outstanding."

The management is cutting back hours so lately it has been hard for every to stay caught up.  I really love my co-workers.  We work well as a team.

good,This company would benefit if they would hire more help. It is very stressful and very demanding on the small staff they have. It is very awarding knowing you are helping customers to be healthy. You also develop a relationship with most customers. You can also find ways to help the customer cut costs of some of the medications.
good,A typical day was the same each day. Working at CVS was a great learning experience and a great title. Co-workers were great! Thought provoking and rewarding!
good,Very fast paced. Intense and hectic. Always one or more new initiatives to deal with. Very brain tasking which was sometimes very rewarding if you succeed. Very competitive environment.
good,"The office environment can be a little stressful at times, but our management team works very well together at problem solving. There definitely needs to be some sort of standardized training for the newly hired employees. Now that CVS has taken over I have seen many positive transitions taking place. I really enjoy working for CVS and with the all the great employees and clients."
good,"The job was reasonably simple. Help customers and keep the store in shape. The only complaint I could possibly make is that we were always understaffed, which put an extra stress on us."
good,My day at work was very professional yet very friendly as well. When there was a down time it was comfortable enough to have a brief conversation and express some stress to a colleague.
good,"My years of service speak for themselves. CVS has always treated me good. The competitive salary, benefits, and vacation time is above average compared to other retail companies. Management has been fair and eager to help if needed."
good,"I have worked in the customer service field for over 15 years, but nothing compares to helping the sick. Working in a pharmacy consists of a great deal of patience, commitment, empathy, and attention to detail. I feel if you do not have these qualities you are not a valuable asset to the working environment as well as those in need of service."
good,I like the relaxed corporate environment at CVS. Flexible work hours and the ability to work with minimal to no supervision.  Working in the facilities department can be quite stressful but the team I worked with at CVS were all great people willing to help out whenever necessary.
good,Friendly knowledgeable trainers and managers. No day was identical and the work was always steady. The only reason I left was for continued education.
good,"The position was respectful and challenging.  My duties was to communicate with customer regarding their payments.  "
good,"I just did a internship there, and was only there for four weeks. It  was a great environment, I loved the hours, and love the people."
good,"This is your typical 9 to 5 job. I""ve been at this job for a short time and have learned coding, testing and QA. The atmosphere is open door policy. Everyone is willing to help in any way to make sure you understand the work you are doing. Interacting with my fellow peers."
good,"CVS provides a good place to work, with updates both with the software and training. There is a feeling of family within the individual stores."
good,"Upon completion of 180 hours for my externship I began from only knowing so much in the field to becoming more familiar with my drugs, brands/generics, and picked up the pace almost immediately once I felt and became more comfortable. I was working in a very busy location in Chandler, AZ. Learned production of filling prescriptions very well and the staff was friendly and helpful in any situations I've encountered,  I was told that I've helped out a lot and was able to fill scripts time accordingly while the staff were all occupied with drive-thru and customers over the counter. There were so many things I was thankful for to have learned. I am a fast learner, respectful, trustworthy and I have a passion to help consumers in need."
good,"My experience in working with the company has been interesting.   I have worked in four different departments and each one was a challenge within itself.  Working here is very different than working in a retail setting.  In a retail setting, you have different tasks thru the day.  Working in mail order, you are pretty much working in the same department doing the same type of work all day.  Being here for 13 years, I have a pretty good knowledge on how mail order works.  Everything is on a larger scale.  The only patient interaction is on the phone.  I think it is a more relaxed environment to work in.  I am an easy person to get along with, so i have never had any major problems with my co-workers.  Things do happen, as in almost any other job setting, but in the end, everyone works out the issues and things go back to normal.  "
good,"the pharmacy personnel are amazing, and i was able to complete my training with enough knowledge to be comfortable working in a pharmacy."
good,Great company to work for. I found humility in this job and balanced my social and college career with ease.
good,Great place to work the people a wonderful. You get to know all about medicine and what the difference is between them.
good,"I have learned various jobs which help me while also going to school. The hardest part of the job is they are always trying to improve things which some did need work but others were working just fine. I got along with my co-workers and some of the management staff that I was working under. Other management team, was nice but I did not have much experience working with them because of the various departments."
good,I think CVS Pharmacy is a greta company to work for espically if you want a career advancement.
good,"loved working here, wish i could have gotten trained on time."
good,"Typical day at work is dispensing medication, solving insurance related issues with insurance companies."
good,"I enjoyed working with CVS Pharmacy over the years. performed many job functions and held many positions. It was a travel job within my state and through out the USA.  "
good,"When working here there costumer service is a good part in CVS, there there environment is pleaent and peaceful. I'm just looking for a new job since I moved"
good,I learned how to talk to customers and be able to help them with any questions they had. The hardest part of the job was making sure all the money was there at the end of the night.
good,"good job"
good,Known for diversity offers an array of options to achieve assignments for each day conquers tasks flawlessly exceptional computer system allows easy work flow
good,"I loved working for CVS as a Store Manager. I left due to the fact that I had a unique opportunity that not many fathers (And retail managers) get. I was able to full time better my education by returning to college in pursuit of my bachelors degree in business management, and I had support from my spouse so I was able to take care of my new born son while my fiance worked. It was something not many people are able to do"
good,"very lovely place to work, a lot of understanding managers. Great employees, great customers @ the location. The DM for my district is very understanding and clear when it comes to his clear view. Overall a great experience working here."
good,"I started off as a stock person putting away boxes in the back stockroom. Then i moved into being the cashier for a little while but, not only was i the cashier i was putting away shopping carts. so overall it was a great experience."
good,Awesome company great to there pharmacy techs. Love and miss them dearly. Theu were all so kind. I only left because i married and moved otherwise i would still be there
good,Fun to work at. The staff was nice and the customers were great in this area. I enjoyed the relaxed environment that cvs has. It’s very laid back and quiet.
good,Happy  working at cvs it's fun they teach u a lot An the pay is good! I been working for cvs for 10 years I help out at other stores which is fun An you learn a lot
good,"fun place to work , loved all coworkers and the environment is great , everyone always has a positive attitude even in stressful situations , management understand personal to work life ratio"
good,I started when I was 15 years old CVS was still Eckerd Drugs. They always promote from within and give you chances for improvement. It like working with your 2nd family since you spend so much time together.
good,The work is very productive fun workplace to be in. The people are very friendly and the management is easy to get along with I was on the order entry.
good,"I love the the job"
good,"I loved working for CVS health , they are truly exceptional. I was able to balance work and school with this company , they care about their employees and create a fun workplace that u could actually look forward to going to everyday"
good,The staff that you work with is amazing! They were flexible with schedules and accommodated any time off that you needed. I loved the feeling of being able to help people.
good,They wrk around your schedule caring people want to see you get a head. Love to be around them made coming to worth it even when I was having a bad day.
good,"Nice company"
good,"ive learned with them is that you really have to prepair yourself for alot of things before you go on the phones. attitudes , make sure you smile and also make sure you are able to help with every question and every thing they asked you to advoid them talking to a supvisor"
good,It is a very good first job experience. Co-workers are very professional and good trainers. Management is very friendly and supportive.
good,"Busy"
good,Employees work hard and care about the customers concerns.
good,Typical day is dispensing medications to patients and taking care of insurance claims. I learned the clinical aspects and as well as the retail area of pharmacy.
good,"A typical day at the pharmacy was alway interesting. The staff and the Pharmacist in charge were very professional even under pressure. I really enjoyed the monthly meetings we had covering our attitudes as a team, our productivity that included our strengths and weaknesses as indiviuals. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people and seeing them with a smile. The hardest part of the job was being able to multi-task to get the desired result that we had in common which was having the medication promised on time."
good,I don't agree with the rate and review culture movement. Primarily  because most people don't have the patience to articulate their own thoughts and use words lazily.
good,"Poorly run pharmacy.  Had certain people that got all the hours, they were not split fairly.  Management seemed to just want a body in there did not really care if they were a good worker or not."
good,I loved working at CVS. I always had something to do. The people I worked with were great. I loved all my customers. I ran register and drive thru in the pharmacy. I answer customer questions when I could. I answered phone and made customer calls. I put prescriptions in bins and pulled old prescriptions from bins. I can't complain about anything I did at work. I enjoyed all of it.
good,"treated like a piece of dirt, not given hours required and agreed in interview.  forever having to sort work and make phone calls to office on your days off."
good,Fill prescriptions for patients. Answer phone calls for patients and counts thousands of pills per day. standing on my feets all-day is the most difficult part of my job.
good,"They never have enough workers at their pharmacies, the work load is horrible and very awful they are literally blood suckers."
good,"Not enough hours giving even though the pay is great."
good,Good company with lots of potential unfortunately management needs more training. Many times managers are not trained correctly and lack the communication with their employees .
good,CVS does not support there employee with families they would rather get rid of them than help them or try to work with them. They make there technician with children jobs very unbearable.
good,"aangename job,geen goede werksfeer."
good,"Hello,"
good,It is not a company that cares about families.  Request for time is rarely granted. Great training though. Skills learned get applied regularly. Pay is little.
good,Its okay if you want to work on a hamster wheel. Just keep going around in circles everyday. The plus side job security and pay raises every 5/10 years.
good,Processed items at the store front as a cashier part time hours processed checks an discounted store coupons worked at the register for full shift busy environment
good,I loved it I want to go back the time went by so fast everyday i love counting drugs and filling scripts. Everyone is very friendly and helpful when you are a just starting great for experience to go to a higher paying pharmacy
good,it was always something new to learn but the pay was very good along with the benefits
good,"for the most part cvs is a pretty great place to work they offer training to become a pharmacy tech if you want it, the managers suck they don't listen to complaints and are rude to customers"
good,management was great and i really enjoyed the crew i worked with.  I personally did not like being in the back and preferred to have hands on with my clients.
good,Typical call center environment but areas to advance within the company. This is the right place for someone who wants to start in the pharmaceutical / healthcare customer service field.
good,"Director calls all shots to advance his career thus ensuring everyone's elses career is destroyed. Nothing good to talk about, But colleagues are excellent, very forthcoming. BAD Management."
good,"Busy workplace. Providing customer service, heavy cash handling, and stocking. Bookkeeping and manage employees."
good,A typical day would be busy.Manageent was good. My co workers was nice and very helpful.The hardest part was getting un satisfied customers.The mot enjoyable part of the job was geting customers that was very joyful and in a good mood.
good,I learned how to be more productive in a work place. The most enjoyable thing was helping the customers I enjoy helping others. The coworkers were great people as well.
good,"I started work at 7am which meant i open til 3pm with sometimes overtime. I also checked on expired dates on the items sold in the store like; sandwiches, drinks etc. ."
good,I have worked here for about 3 months and I am happy to say that the work flow is definitely busy. Each day is a case by case basis as in any other retail setting. Show up to work with an up beat attitude and your day will go smoothly.
good,"It was a nice retail experience, along with knowledge that I can carry on in the future. Great way to work with others and help people with their health or daily needs."
good,"Filling prescriptions, counting pills, having the extremely hard task of getting insurance to cover prescriptions or applying insurance to prescription, servicing everyone in a very fast paced manner.  What I learned was that I wasn't cut out for the job.  It was too stressful for me.  Management was very fair.  Workplace culture was par for the course.   The most enjoyable part of the job was helping someone in the most basic way.  It was providing a service to them for something that was unfortunate and probably hard to deal with (meaning what brought them to the pharmacy in the first place)."
good,"High volume pharmacy that concentrates more in numbers than patient-provider interaction, some managers are great others absolutely terrible! Absolute no respect for family responsibilities"
good,"I rate this as a great place to work because it is a win-win-win situation for the patients. 1. The patients win because they are released from the hospital days/weeks earlier; 2. the hospitals win because they free up their beds for more critical patients; and, 3. the insurance companies/Medicare win because the cost of a hospital stay is about $1,800/day plus the cost of the drug.  With home infusion the cost is reduced to about $100/day plus the cost of the drug.  However, the company talks about ethics and patient safety but regional managers don't understand the business and have no ethics.  It's really too bad as this company has the ability to really help  patients.  When the regional managers direct employees to do illegal or unethical tasks,  patient safety is at risk."
good,"On an average day at CVS you are required to fill prescriptions, handle customers, and answer the phone efficiently in a way that doesn't disturb the work flow. Working here you learn many different combinations of medications and mathematical conversions and what roles specific medications does and what the can and can't be mixed with. management isn't too employee friendly and they aren't a ""Customer based"" organization but the workplace is pretty organized and clearly understood. It can become overwhelming dealing with a large amount of people that are in need of life threatening medication but if you are properly trained and don't let the pressure overwhelm you. It is a great feeling to be able to help the customer and build a relationship with them."
good,"you are monitored and timed on your  performance. You have 60 minutes for a basic case, 1/2 hr if it is medicare or medicaid. A very repetitive position, need to have patience always new, sometimes information is hard to find/research. insurance background a must for this position. Ability to navigate /multitask on dual monitors."
good,CVS was great to work for. Loved meeting new people coming into the store each day. co-workers were like family. We stocked shelves and straightened the store. Room for advancement was minimal.
good,It was a part time job and it was very enjoyable. It was fun seeing the people go crazy coupon-ing. There were many pros of working there. The discount was nice and it was a friendly atmosphere.
good,"On a typical day, I would receive calls from Pharmacist to help with medication refills, overrides, and insurance coverage. I did learn a lot there and have made many close colleagues as a result working there that I'm very grateful for."
good,I loved my job until recent events I never thought I would leave it looking for my forever job. We enter and count scripts wait on  is
good,"good for a first job"
good,Awsome atmosphere and company. there is a passion for their customers and clients. They care about process and procedures.
good,"Very Good Management very good store, i would love to work there again"
good,i would not work there beyond college unless you are a pharmacist.
good,Good teaching environment the management was almost too hard to work for. The other emplyees were also not so helpful
good,I would of spent the rest of my life there if the Pharmacy Manager did not have her own issues and took them out on me.
good,"taking rx from patients, inputting rx info into computer system. dispensing meds to be verified by pharmacist, cashier, inventory of mes monthly, insurance prior auths, billing ?s for pts about their ins, consult pt about meds with questions"
good,"It’s an awesomeness place to work but the management is horrible due to low staffing. The higher the volume of the store, the better you’ll be. My store wasn’t understanding of my time off needed."
good,Apply only if your seeking to learn. The pay sucks and the management sucks. Always under staffed. Short lunch breaks. Best way to get compensated for your hard work is to go to school and be certified .
good,"I was position at the self check out registers scanning my overwrite card for customers that are checking out, no cross training for weekend work on the store floor. No knowledge of the process and policies of my customer service/cashier duties."
good,"If you don't have much skills, then working at CVS is a great way to increase your skills and find a better job.  There are several types of skills you can get by working here."
good,"Depending on your manager it can be fun or crazy stressful and busy, or laid back and fun. You need to be very personable because you speak with a lot of different and demanding people all day."
good,"My co-workers are fun to work with and are very understanding. Management needs a lot of help, they are very sexist  and the General Manager of the store is never anywhere around when they are needed."
good,I deal with customers and help them with inquires and help them with their orders. I also make their medication under the supervision of the licensed pharmacist. I also reach out to doctors and insurance company to find out if the medication is covered.
good,"At Omnicare I have learned a lot about the long term care medical field of life.  It was very interesting.  I really enjoyed my job and the life and obligations of the job.  But the third time hired there,  as I was heart n soul into my job,  I had another employee harass me and when doing the right thing of going to the hr I was told she was drama deal with her.  I didn't want her fired as she was also a good employee, I just wanted to have a meeting with us both as we was adults and not high school teenagers.  When the issue wasnt solve I volunteerly gave up a good job bc I could not deal with her.  I have learn now that God gave me another job into the long term care field and I will never let another employee like that intiminate me again. I am sorry for quitting but Over the years that same employee cause a lot of other employees to quit."
good,Enter doctor credentials with licensing information.  Assisting sales reps with maintaining accounts by merging them together.  Assist management with special projects as they are introduce into the department.  Go over ideas with the team in meetings regarding various changes in the department on making workload better and easier.
good,I was only there for 6 weeks of my pharmacy technician externship. I had some of the best people showing me what to expect and how a pharmacy works. It was a wonderful experience for me.
good,"A typical day was coming in and helping the pharamcy technicians sort out the bad medicine and good medicine, helped making the calls out to the customers for the medication letting them know there medications was ready to be picked up learned how to sort medicine, count medicine, stock medicine, and make sure that the medicines went out to the correct people and by doing that you had to make sure their address was correct and their phone number was correct and you had to check their date of birth for security reasons. management was very professional and they knew what they were doing and how to do it, they taught me alot about different medicines and what they are used for and how the doses for the medicines are very important when taking them, The co-workers were ver well trained they taught me alot also like how to complete prescription refills and calling in the refills for the patients. The most hardest part of the job was removing all the bad medicines, counting them and then throwing them out. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the smiles on the customers faces when you hand them there prescriptions."
good,enhances your terminology
good,Good job for a highschool student with little responsibilities
good,Coram Healthcare was a great place to work. I was alway learning something new and I enjoyed that. It was a fast paced work enviornment with mulitple accounts. You need to be able to multi-task work there in order to keep up.
good,Work any hours and travel excessively but the bonuses are great and compensation
good,Salary and pay benefits does not reflect the job that someone does as one is always looking for second jobs to meet growing financial demands even as supervisor. Career path can be good if improved upon these short comings
good,"management is not in order. Too often are individuals "" categorized"" as favorites or not; This, unfortunately, determines your treatment and hours! I worked hard to get into this company, to then WALKING AWAY due to lack of great management."
good,"long shifts "
good,"Your experience working at CVS depends on your manager. Your manager can make or break your experience working here. If you show that you are a hard worker, you will have a better time."
good,"NPs can work independently as an NP and administrator  of the clinic.Its stressful but its a fun to work independently.Learned to perform drug test and DOT, school, and pre-employment physical and referred them as needed.Learned to order and perform lab tests such Rapid strep, lipid panel and A1C test."
good,I loved the customers that came to visit me on the regular everyday. Some employees are awesome to work with and some management weren't as friendly like they should of been but I learned to adapt quickly and work around it.
good,"I recently left CVS after working there for 13 years!  I hadn't had a raise in 6 years and was maxed out for the tech position.  I was part-time, but they make becoming full time hard!  You must work 30 hours + weekly for 6 months, but it's specific months.  March - September or September to March.  So if you're hired in April, you won't become full time until the next March.  I really needed benefits and those are ONLY available once a year.  No PTO if you're part-time.  I loved the customers and they were flexible with my schedule when I needed it."
good,"Rewarding career with opportunities to have a direct positive impact on patient care in the home setting.  Fast paced, high stress work environment that requires a true team effort to manage."
good,Pharmacy is very fast paced and everchanging in my opinion it is not for the weak.  There is plenty of room for advancement if you know how to network.
good,"I am enjoying the work environment, the people in it and the work. The only reason I am looking for work is that I am a temporary employee with no benefits. My supervisor is great and I have enjoyed the challenging work."
good,It's a good place to enter into the pharmamcuetical industry. It's a decent comapny to work for. It is flexible if you are working another job or going to school.
good,A typical day here was just ringing up costumers things and giving them back there change. Also stocking shelves and unloading boxes. The hardest thing about this job was doing all the work and not having a really good pay
good,"Working in this environment was interesting, I learned many new things about medications.  It broadened my knowledge of prescriptions, insurance coding, and billing."
good,"Typical day would be help ringing up the customers and answer any questions they may have, make sure the store is neat and organized. The workplace can be stressful and the training is not at all helpful."
good,"Overall working at CVS has been a good experience in learning about billing, prescriptions, and medications that are new to the system. Good environment."
good,"the double standard at this place is ridiculous they management acts like the can relate and understand but they don't they sit behind a desk make 50,000 more then us a year I hate this job but my co workers are hard working people just trying to support there familys just like my self and this is the only opportunity in this town"
good,Management doesn't have back home. Don't get raises like you should. Ask how to do something and told not sure how to do it. Try to move up and can't get should of district management. But want to critize you when the do come.
good,I always had a good day working for this company. It wasn't always busy. the customers were nice the co-workers were nice and so was the manager. the only time it got hectic was when all the customers can in with coupons.
good,A typical day consists of stocking shelves and running the cash register throughout your whole shift. Some of the managers are really nice and others not so much. The hardest part was having to get work done while it's really busy.
good,"Working here as a pharmacy technician, I learned  so much and was able to apply what I've learned at other jobs as well as everyday life. The job required a lot of tasks to be done, the only con was that it did not pay much."
good,"It was a fun place to work at. Sometimes the workload felt like it was a bit heavy, but we always found ways to complete our tasks. Great way to learn how to provide customer service, multitask, and complete projects under pressure."
good,"Co workers were great, management liked to throw their weight around, one in particular, my immediate sup was great.  What else do you want?"
good,"Good place to work, good management team, trust in team members and management team, honesty, learn something new each day."
good,"While working at CVS, i learned so much about medicine and how it works for people. Ive learned so much being here. I really enjoyed working here."
good,"i did my extern at CVS.  All the people where very nice to work with.   I learned a lot and got to see a lot of different things.Performed Strep test, urine dips, Obtained Vital Signs, Entered Patient Data in to Computer snystem,  Ordered and Stocked Supplies."
good,Productive and stable environment to work. A typical day at work is greeting and acknowledging customers in pick up and drive thru. I do inventory and RTS report every day and mix medication under the supervision of the pharmacist.
good,"The job is very stressful unless you have great management and co workers who actually try to get their job done. CVS has good intentions but they need better people in management, well at least my store did. I prefer to work up front."
good,Wish they could pay a bit more to their state certified pharmacy techs.
good,I was a cashier and a photo tech. Ringing customers up and printing customers pictures. Really enjoyed working with my co-workers.
good,Room for growth for those who are willing to put their all into
good,"Good place to work just did recieve enough hours for insurance but performed resets or planograms, cashiering, and customer service, and making sure that all tasks are performed correctly."
good,"Its a good job and it pays well but it will suck your soul. The company culture is toxic. You will encounter employees who are outstanding, different characters but there are also lots of people that get hired who absolute have no reason working in a pharmacy. Customers on the other hand are very miserable and no always a joy to work with. People that visit CVS are often on drugs because they are not always feeling well. People who don't feel well often take out their frustration on store employees."
good,it was a new exciting experience i just wish i wasn't pregnant coming in so i was able to stay longer and have a more enjoyable experience with the company
good,"If you're full-time, you have decent benefits. Their merger with Aetna means you're going to have pretty good health insurance, which is necessary nowadays."
good,Its a great place to work just hard to get ahead. Its hard to move up in this company if you already work there! Its very repetitive. Some thing rarley change but i like that in a position.
good,I learned so much in my position at CVS. One of the top things I learned was how to deal with difficult people and how to let go of the issue so it didn't affect the rest of the day. The hardest part of the job is learning all of the job requirements. It is much more than just interacting with the customer. I enjoyed there was always something different to tackle everyday.
good,"Work is usually very busy. Too many work stations but not enough staff to fill it. However, a long shift tends to go by quickly because there's always something to do."
good,"productive and fun work environment .you can learn new thing easily."
good,It was good for a temp position they do extend your contract but it would be nice to just be hired directly. Otherwise a pretty okay place to work. They are very health oriented.
good,"cvs company now has been many changes over the past eight years i have worked here for the most part very pleasant, would recommned to beginnners"
good,This is a great company to work for although the management and hours are horrible. Work most holidays and have longer night. The company in whole is great but there are other things about it that will make it not the greatest job.
good,"Enjoyed working there, people were very nice. Opportunity for advancement. Team Spirit, great environment. Everyone cared about the patients they served."
good,I was in massage school when I worked here so I would be getting out of school from a 1 1/2 cummute to start an 8 hour shift. Everything was handled professionally at cvs pharmacy.
good,"Great Company to work at, great staff flexibles shifts I would recommend this job to college students or individuals that want that are looking for potential growth or opportunity for advancement"
good,Very busy but small place. It's a school so people are in and out all day. Management wasn't very open to new ideas. No raises or chances to advance.
good,the folks I worked with were all friendly. the only downfall wall the my immediate supervisor and dept manager neither of which had a real handle on what the A/R  Dept of Minute clinic was suppose to do. we had better management before but they moved on to bigger and better things in Minute Clinic.
good,"I have worked all shifts at cvs pharmacy, i love the first shift. I love to set the tone for the day, and the pace. When the other team members start to come in its like a machine begins to work more and more efficient. We do work together to not only get the job done, but to put or keep the patient/customer on a path to better health.The most enjoyable portion of my job is the production, where i gather, count and edited the prescription before it reaches the pharmacist.The hardest portion of my job is the prescription drop off. Sometimes the most difficult part of it is the insurance, but with time and patience I was able to handle it more efficiently."
good,CVS was very flexible with me and my school life. I loved working for the company.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is getting the patients the help they deserve.
good,"I enjoy working for CVS/Pharmacy. I love what I do there and I concur with the companys values. The nly thing I would say is contradictory is the ""open door"" policy. Yea...soon as you open the door, expect to be hit on the way out. Communicating with management and others alike was like pulling teeth..from a pitbull..I still don't understand how you treat your best employees like nothing. Anywho! Thats a whole other story."
good,what i learn there is how to move very quick it was a very fast pace job.The co-workers where great very friendly and help for the hardset part of the job was leaving it only seasonal.
good,I worked POS systems as well as the RxNet computer system to properly fill prescriptions.
good,Mostly everyday I learn new things about this field. New drugs being released or new drugs being back ordered and stuff like that kept me interested in this company. The company provided or paid for trainings for the employees to develop their knowledge in this field.
good,"As a pharmacy technician you work closely with the public, i learned to read prescriptions and medical terminology. My coworkers and I always worked as a team to get prescriptions filled in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job is doing everything on a time limit. The most enjoyable part to me was getting to know new people everyday."
good,I loved working for cvs because i loved how they make us go the extra mile for customers. since working with them i only get my meds from cvs. However i did not like the high turn over rate and how managers would team up against other employees. I have seen this done state wide because i transferred to another state with this company. Me personal problems are faced at ever job i basically took the negative and made it workl out for the better. by the high turn over rate i was forced to learn how to do everything in short notice because we were always short handed. all and all this job has made me a better employeer for the next company so i appreciate that.
good,"CVS has a great enviornment, diverse staff, many opportunities to move up. The call center has team mentality. Supervisors are supportive. My current job has good working hours."

good,Great place to work. Great people.  No room for advancement unless you are a family member. Not liking having to write reviews of past employers to post a resume.
good,"I worked a supervisor position here for a year I worked 3 different stores the first store wasn’t the best but I didn’t give up, ended up quitting and re applying. I worked at two stores with two great managers after I relocated myself , the management was fair and awesome to the team and offered Developement opportunities.

good,"Excellent atmosphere Management is very cooperative "
good,"Love the work environment."
good,"I would constantly be told off by customers almost daily and the boss did not do much about it.Would get scheduled for days that I had school and overall was a negative atmosphere. Pay was great, the opportunities to move up were avaliable, not what I would do for the rest of my life though."

The opportunity CVS gave me made me realize there are other people in the world going thru more than u. Its better to help people along the the way"
good,This company is always looking for new ways to help their patients out with their pharmaceutical needs. I was happy to work for a very focused group of individuals.

The most enjoyable thing about this job is when you find a product for a customer, that is difficult to source and they get smile in their face. helping people is fun for me and it comes naturally"
good,Working for CVS/pharmacy was very challenging but interesting. At time their would be customers that would have a problem during their shopping experience but my job is to calm the situation and make sure the customer leaves satisfied and make sure they would want to come back and shop again.
good,This was my first job after graduating college. I loved it there. I appreciate it so much more now that I’ve had other jobs that weren’t anywhere near how great this place was.
good,This job was great and flexible during my high school and college years. Good company to work for but not a a longterm career. Great company to be part of for 9 years.
good,"Your employees will know what you expect of them. They will receive feedback, praise, and criticism of their work, and they will be on notice of any shortfalls in their performance or conduct."
good,This position is a great position to start in. I stayed with CVS for all of my training and certifications. They provided the adequate training for me to feel comfortable.
good,Large enterprise that allows for many opportunities for those who seek to advance their career. There are multiple groups and subgroups to allow each colleague to find the place that suits them best.
good,"CVS is what it is, Most employees unhappy because of their outraged goals for each pharmacy while they continue to cut hours. Unhappy workers means terrible work environment.,"
good,"The management has been fair and very accommodating.  They offer opportunities for growth and training.  I would like to work in the medical or health industry, and working with customers."
good,"The good of CVS/pharmacy is that you're always busy so time passes. However, always understaffed and wishing you had more help. It's stressful and fast paced."
good,"i had been working in cvs for 12 years, in general is a nice place to work, and like every place the quality of the environment changes with the personality of the store manager. Some times I have had very rude store managers, who do not care about employees, and sometimes I have had really good managers that care about employees and the job. I really like my job and the store where I work right now."
good,This job is very good to have full time for the benefits and other compensations that they offer. I recommend this job for anyone because it’s a easy going environment.
good,"A typical day at work depends on the tasks assigned for the day. Some days include unloading trucks, putting up sales tags, and most importantly customer service. The customer service experience I have received has certainly provided me with invaluable experience as a nurse."
good,"As a manager at CVS, I learned skills and important factors of leadership that couldn't be taught to me by word of mouth, and learned the importance of delegation and accomplishing daily tasks in a timely manner."
good,Great until the position was eliminated from the company. Now the position is under a different job description and name ..................................................................

good,I would recommend to anyone looking for a relaxed environment and great staff. Hours were flexible and pay was okay. Great teamwork and activities for staff

good,"Great place to work. The Supervisors were very nice. Good benefits. Lots of different jobs. Great company to work at, if you want to move up in the company."
good,The interviewer wasn’t at all presentable and didn’t shave any requirements for the job. Easily accepts anybody. But I do love the Cvs company. They have a lot of varieties for anything you need from toilet paper to makeup.
good,I handled money measure that my customers were satisfied with their visit you found everything that they need to find when they came to the and store stock the shelves
good,My jobs really easy and most of the time relaxed. Nothing is too difficult once you learn it's pretty smooth. The only thing that sucks is being on the bottom of the seniority pole. I get stuck cashiering 90% of my shifts instead of doing the job I was hired to do because we don't have enough cashiers. I understand it's not their fault but I really hate cashiering all day. If I wanted to be a cashier full time I would've applied to be one
good,"Long hours on your feet and constantly back and forth from cash register to the floor.  You will stay busy so the work hours go by fast.  This location is busy with constant customer interactions through the day.  You must be in good health physically to handle long days on feet, constantly laborious work."
good,"Extremely high volume workplace, but with the right skills it is doable. Trained very well to do the job that I had to do. Compensation at time did not meet expectations."
good,"Very good insightful Intel on how to find a job. Only wish I knew about this sooner.i recommend"
good,"I love working for CVS Health. I have the best manager and co workers, I could ask for. Recently hours have been cut due to Self Checkouts, CVS corporate has been throwing a lot of things at us at one time so It makes the work environment somewhat stressful, but we are all trying to adjust the best way we can. The money is good and I love working in a fast paced environment, and for the company."
good,"I was in the CVS pharmacy in Suffolk, VA. to complete 120 hours, unpaid cooperative externship/training for my career school requirements to get my diploma. So, since I didn't actually work for the company, but externed, I am NOT actually able to fill out the review as most go."
good,"Typical day at work includes data entry, production, and contacting either doctor's offices or third parties."
good,We pick items by the order the prompt.hardest part of the job is that sometimes its alot of walking. I really enjoy working there and the pay is really good
good,"I typically worked behind the counter helping customers check out and answer any questions they needed. Being in New York, you come across a wide variety of people and situations that teach you how to grow as an individual as well as how to handle multiple scenarios. I encountered stealing, happy and angry customers, pets of all kinds, etc. The experience helped me become more prepared for the future."
good,Great environment to work. I enjoy working there and being apart. I learn new things everyday and it’s definitely a place I look forward to coming to.

good,"Environment was good, fairly good management and organization. Did not have a good rotation of workers for the evening shifts because people were always on first and second shift"
good,"Most of what the job entails is typical of a pharmacy-stocking shelves, minding the premise for any thefts, and recommending products to customers. CVS was a great experience for me when I had the time and ability for such a position, when school did not ask too much of my time and studying. For the sake of employment, I would recommend that you work with shifts with someone at the drinking age if you're not-store does sell alcohol, even though it focused on tobacco quitting products"
good,I was able to learn and apply concepts learned in pharmacy school. Excellent way to learn about what it takes to be a pharmacist while in school. The hours are good too.
good,Amazing company just wasn't right for me.Worked 4- 10 and learned alot about customer service. Had great coworkers whom i loved to work with. all around great place to work
good,Good company to work for with a lot of good benefits. If you work in the store area you have growth opportunity to move up to management and beyond. In the pharmacy the only growth opportunity you have is moving up to lead technician.
good,"No real complaints, just a bit of favoritism. I learned a lot and will take that knowledge with me to future companies. I appreciate the training program they had in place, it really did set me on the right path."
good,"Worked there for a few years a while back. I never thought that the day I got hired to work there, that it would end up being my favorite job I've had to this day. The store manager was so cool it made working there a breeze. The assistant managers were great too. I moved to pharmacy within like 2 months of being there and the Pharmacists were awesome too. I know not all stores are as great as 05670 but CVS was a great place to work in my opinion."

good,"I loved working there, greeting others. I am very happy to say I loved working and couldn't wait to get to work. Very friendly energy and comfortable environment."
good,"Consisted of clocking in on time, relieving whoever was on shift at that time up front and carry out my duties as a cashier. usually worked 8 hour shifts, sometimes longer and I enjoyed my work."
good,When I first started it was very difficult. A few months later it was just difficult. Before I left it was only hard. The system was different and took a moment for me to understand it.
good,"This is a wonderful place to work. Great opportunities for advancement, wonderful benefits, great people. If I weren't going to school for a different field, I would still be there. It's truly a place you can make a career out of."

good,"Working at CVS was a great experience. I had great coworkers that helped me become the technician I am now. They taught me the different names of drugs as well what they are for. My customer service improved with the different type of customers that enter the pharmacy, I was able to learn how to manage difficult customers with the appropriate steps, so the customer will leave the pharmacy pleased. At times I did have a hard time figuring out the software since it was new to me but with the help of my coworkers, I manage to understand it and do it on my own. I really enjoyed going to work because of the customers that enter the pharmacy most of them were nice and caring. I also enjoyed helping customers and learning new tasks."

Management failed to value the team it had and lost a lot of valuable members."

Then I'd go and file if needed, put up any pills or creams that needed to be put up, help count pills and work with customers to help them get what they need.

Hardest part was managing controls that had to be counted by hand in large numbers, and most enjoyable part was counting."

good,"I thought I would just be selling medicine, but as a pharmacy technician you get to learn about diverse health-related situations and how to solve it. Being a pharmacy tech requires the utmost care to go out of your way to be the middle man between them and their doctor or their insurance. A little effort goes a long way into making sure people get their medicine on time at the most affordable price whilst reminding them that they are due for the refills."

good,I loved being Assistant Manager because i enjoyed working with the manager. I moved up to this position from store clerk very rapidly and learned so much.
good,"A typical day at the job is clocking and getting your system set up and phone ready to take calls. I learned how to search the system for information when in need rather than being so quick to call a manager. Management was very attentive and helpful in getting situations resolved for the workers and the customers. There really wasn't too many difficult parts of the job, once you learn everything it's pretty repetitive. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was a very relaxed environment to work in and everyone was easy going and easy to get along with"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer.

good,A typical day at CVS Pharmacy was to dispense medicines and consult patients.
good,I enjoyed my work at CVS Caremark. A typical day at work gave me the opportunity to enhance my skills and feel that I had contributed to meeting the company goals. Encouragement was given to team building exercises and improving productivity.
good,"I learned a majority of the pharmacy techinicians duties, my co-workers helped me alot through out my internship. The hardest part of the job was entering insurance information and the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help customers with there pharmacy related problems.There satisfaction made my day!"
good,Typical call center enviroment. People were friendly and management was helpful.
good,"fast pace, fast service, customer serivce, worked with outgoing happy people. i loved my job there"
good,Coworkers were very informative about drugs and all the duties that are done in pharmacy. I also enjoyed the fast pace and busy environment.
good,I really loved my externship experience at CVS. It truly was great!
good,"This job was a great learning experience. This job required a certain degree of time management skills. A typical day involved developing quality photos in the photolab while also maintaining excellent customer service. Management was excellent, and they provided great direction."
good,Was a good company to work for. Would still be there if the plant didn't move out of the country.
good,"A typical day are work started with me filling out prescription orders for the delivery drivers. When I am done with that, I would fill blister packs for medications that are in high demand. The management team are nice, easy-going people. Co-workers are friendly. The hardest part of the job would be getting all the orders out in time for the deliveries. I enjoyed the awesome people at the job, I laugh every day."

good,I love the customers that I deal with on a normal day. Co-Workers are great because they all like to have a good time while being professional. It is a nice to go into work and be able to have a good time along with getting work done. I have learned so much from working at CVS. Learning the drug names along with what they are used for.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me starting the day off working in one of three workstations and working them all by the end of my shift. The workstations were drop-off, where the prescriptions and patient profiles are input into the system and outgoing calls are made to the doctor's office if needed and to the patients for different matters, the second station is production, where the medications are prepared and packed for the pharmacist to review, telephone calls are recieved from the patients and doctors, and the third is pick-up where the patient comes in and pick up the medication and ask any questions that they may have for the pharmacist. Working at CVS has taught me strong customer service skills, customer confidentiality, and to work well as a team member. My pharmacy manager was also the head pharmacist and was a great person to work with along with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was letting customers know that their medication was not available when that certain medication was out of stock. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help the customers and assist them with their medical needs."
good,"Assist the pharmacist in receiving prescriptions, collecting patient information, and entering prescriptions in the computer; prepare prescriptions; answer telephones, customer service"
good,Very established company pay wasnt to great but good job security
good,"Everyday is a challenging day for me. You learn new things everyday, busy environment makes your day enjoyable with jokes with customers and other co-workers. You have to be highly talented in the environment i work in. One should come up with a solution in less than a minute, with positive and cost saving outcome."
good,"Productive and busy workplace. Work hours is flexible. Requires some lifting heavy stuff and walking, standing most of the time."
good,"CVS Pharmacy is a fast paced work environment, i learned team building skills as well as general facts about medication. the management was very helpful as well as my coworkers. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the overflow of customers at the counter and the drive through. the most enjoyable part would be my coworkers."
good,Many hours provided. Dependable work schedule and staff. Overtime provided for amy employees
good,A typical day at work is picking and packing. The management is good. The co-workers are nice. The hardest part of the job is trying to get 95%.
good,This was my first job. I was a cashier and after some time they trained me to be a photo lab technician. I really enjoyed working for them.
good,management was nice
good,"The Pharmacists are a joy to work with. I have been given the opportunity to gain respect, and work in an organized and technical atmosphere, which I am thankful for, because of its impact on my career development."
good,"if you have a family cvs/caremark isnt the job for you. the have mandtory over time all the time.. its like you live there. they arent very understanding when you have to miss work for your childs health,or care if your pregnant they still only care about attendance."
good,"Did not actually 'work' here, had to complete 160 hours no pay in order to finish my course at Everest. The staff was very friendly though. They would all try to show me new things and do anything they could to help me succeed. I learned a lot in the 4 weeks I spent there and couldn't have chose a better place to learn the ropes."
good,"My typical day in the pharmacy was filled with Rx entry, inventory, filling, drive-thur and cleaning. I learned some new skill sets for example how to order drugs from suppliers. The management was good. My co-workers were valuable to my experience there. The hardest part of my job was reading doctors handwriting on scripts."
good,I really enjoyed my short internship at CVS and would like to work there one day
good,I was able to learn about different medications and also was able to interact with customers. It was a good experience on both sides of the counter.
good,"The people that I worked with were nice and we worked as a team. I was able to move up after being hired as a temporary cashier. When I left CVS Pharmacy, it was a very hard choice to do but it was neccessary for me at the time."
good,"CVS Caremark would have been an excellent place to work. Unfornately, I broke my ankle before I could finish training and did not get the full experience of working for the company. Management was nice for the short time I was there. The trainers were excellent they really made you feel good about the place they were training you to work for. The best part of the job would have been being able to help the customers/client that called in for information about the their presrciptions or accounts."
good,loved helping customers get the items that they was looking for. also enjoyed my fellow employees.
good,"The customers you get each day are all fun, happy outgoing people. They become regulars to where you can great them by name. When I was developing film, customers would give a short life story about their photos, or stories behind them. I loved it when my regulars came in and carried on a conversation with me only because I knew they had no one to confide in. I loved working there"
good,CVS provided me with opportunities to grow within the company
good,"it's a really good starter job but it can get really stressful and demanding, management isn't too good."
good,The short time I spent working as an extern at CVS Pharmacy was good. The Pharmacists I worked under were exceptional. They were always courteous and helpful. It is a great place to get trained because CVS is a busy pharmacy. Would love to work there again.
good,i found it challenging but very rewarding always busy always something to do love to help customers and also co workers to get the job done in a timely manner i found it a great place to work
good,"Great customer service experience. Great benefits. 401K, Vision, Health and Dental insurance available."
good,I loved working at CVS and got along well with management and others. My hours were cut and I would love to work for them again.
good,"the Manhattan beach cvs/ pharmacy has a wonderful managers, they are very understanding, helpful managers also the staffs are very pleasant to work with, i will refer my friends, families or anyone to work with cvs/pharmacy"
good,"A typical work day includes waiting on customers and helping them in whatever they need help with. I also check in the many vendors that supply us with certain items. Any phone calls or questions, I am able to handle them. My co-workers trust my opinion and often give me tasks that they might not give someone else. I'm very friendly and can learn anything very quickly."
good,"Although your job description says you will be filling prescriptions, it should say that you will spend most of your time comforting whiny customers who have the patience of a toddler. People who last long in the pharmacy are usually the ones who enjoy the fast-paced, sometimes chaotic environments. Others drop out fast. One good thing about working in the pharmacy is that members of the pharmacy usually build a close bond because we work in close quarters and have to support each other. But pay at CVS was really bad."
good,"Even if one is a cashier, this is a job that requires a lot of moving around. Walking, lifting, and sometimes climbing. Good for those needing to keep moving."
good,"I typically work weekends, as I’m not given many hours. Ad signs get taken down on Saturday’s and the new ones get put back up on Sunday’s. Every day I help maintain the cleanliness of the store and front and face the entire store, all whilst taking care of customers."
good,"Great place to work BUT poor & racist management, only pay more attention to whoever fits their like. Sink or swim environment for those who doesn’t fit their likes."
good,"An innovative, resourcesfull and flexible American citizen with 4 years and counting of professional work experience leading teams in tailoring and adopting agile principles and frameworks."
good,"I enjoyed working for CVS, was actually going through some family problem. I enjoyed working within teamwork,  and the customers. Working there thought me Patient and i love helping people."
good,"Depending on which store manager you get, your experience can be great or disheartening. Choose wisely. Some managers refuse to let you transfer if your situation changes."
good,"I worked here for about a year and the DM was real cool and worked with me on relocating me when i was leaving for school. The holidays were busy here, but other than that it ran smooth."
good,"some days are laid back, we stay steady. i do my weekly tasks, i always finish somedays, somedays im interrupted to assist a customer i may get busy again and not be able to finish but the next coworker coming in on their shift can sometimes finis up things left undone for the day. on our truck days its intense and busy, constantly runnning back and forth finding where the merchandise has to go, picking up heavy totes and bending and squatting to do things, its a workout and very tiring. some days i have to help in photo and help a customer up front and i have to juggle everything so some days that can be stressful. but i love it, i love the people i learn a lot from my manager and how to do things easier to make things easier on me. ive learned patience and how to be productive and get things done on time. management needs work, disciplinary actions need to be taken place when things are done wrong or something that shouldnt happen. over the year of being at cvs i learned that if you dont leave your issues at home you will bring them to work and every customer knows when your in a bad mood. its got a lot easier now im smiling and always joyful and i always make my customers happy and laugh."
good,"CVS is a great company to work for, pharmacist are great, patients are great. Very fast paced but I don't feel I was compensated as my other coworkers"
good,I loved my job at CVS.  I enjoyed interacting with the Customers.  I learned a lot about the photo lab while employed at CVS and the customer service industry.
good,Was told as a consultant that I would be hired as a permanent employee... I relocated for this role and released after 15 months......................
good,the company has great potential! I do wish however that they put more time into actual patient care and and sensitivity. The work environment is outstanding. You are greeted with smiling faces and the team I’ve had the pleasure to work with the past few years are really good at quick problem solving.
good,"If they don't like you, they will find reasons to let you go or make it harder for you at work. You are on the phones 100% of the time. They schedule you to take online learning but expect you to do the online learning class in between calls. They will never let you work on any projects."
good,Learn very fast. This place will make or break you once you hit the building. A company or more so the stores i worked in they lack in employee development and even in manager development. Politics rule.
good,CVS as a whole is a very good company to work for. If you can succeed in the Specialty portion of the business then you will be able to succeed in any other business in the world!
good,"CVS gave me chance to learn a lot and also I end up to go back to school to continue my education to apply for pharmacy school "
good,Loved my job and it was exciting and fum until management changed. Then it became boring and repetitive and management did not even know how to answer questions about my position because they did not even know how to do it.
good,"Being a pharmacy tech is really stressful especially once you start out. Sometimes pharmacists can be really impatient and a little mean, but it is understandable because they deal with a lot. CVS also surprisingly really cares about their worker's pay because I got a raise that really changed a lot, I mean a lot of techs were working for minimum wage in the first place which isn't exactly fair for the work we do but at least CVS finally heard us out and gave us a big pay raise."
good,"I love what I do.  The 15+ years have been a learning and inspiring culture to grow and develop.  With the new vision and direction of the company we will assist with helping patients to living a healthier and longer life.  The most enjoyable part of my current position is building relationships with employees."
good,"I view CVS as one of the top drug stores to offer better health, CVS has a tobacco free policy which I think is amazing. Working at CVS, you are guaranteed to learn more about patient health and promoting customer service to each individual. CVS gives every employee the opportunity to excel in the career at CVS. There are always opportunities for growth and elevation within the company. A typical day at work would be cashing out customers, watching the front lobby, stocking and putting up the order. the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers. CVS has a well Managed team and everything we do includes team work. I've learned alot working at CVS in the pharmacy department. the online training courses were long and tedious, but very helpful. i was able to retain majority information given through online training as well as hands on."
good,Great place to work. a lot of changes going on and a lot of people that dont want to listen to reason. you are just a number and thats all nothing more
good,"hard days with usually a rush at end of the day. on call night once a week may be until midnight or later.on call weekends were a nightmare, since most time you only had one tech to help. Usually had to do all paperwork and order entry as well as pull ancillary items for infusion, like pumps or dial-a-flow tubings and other supplies. had to arrange for delivery and wait fir their arrival which could take hours especially at night"
good,"If you are seeking a job that is willing to work with your school schedule, then this is the job for you. They offer flexible scheduling, but depending on the location."
good,Its a good start if you never had a job before. The company cares about you and you learn a lot. You have to be good at handling customers problems and be able to multitask.
good,"You stayed busy there between customer care, deliveries, and stocking.  The other employees were nice & easy to work with.  The hardest part was no benefits."
good,I could not ask for better management. My boss works with me with my College schedule and allows me to work only when I need to. I have been able to gain experience through my time there.
good,I definitely enjoyed working in this surrounding and being able to connect with the people. I would definitely work as a store clerk or a pharmacist again.
good,"My experience there wasn't as great as it could have been but only because I was diabetic and didn't know it. The hours were great and my weekends were off, which was a plus. I would recommend working there."
good,CVS pharmacy is good place for customers well being.. CVS pharmacy is about genuine care and heart when it comes to our customers. We appreciate our customers we make sure they are the path to better health.
good,"I worked overnight 10pm - 6am , did that for 2 almost 3 years. One cashier and one manager to clean and restock the entire store while counting tills and ringing up customers. It wasn't easy but you get into a routine  that works and you get your job done. The danger comes when and if something falls in the stock room and you cant get out your only possible help would be manning the store; or possible robberies. If at my location there was a 3rd person working , would've made a world of difference ."
good,"It was a great place to work, but horrible pay. Never got the schedule you wanted, and someone was always calling off, with no consequences. Its good for you, if you want to be irresponsible, because you will still have a job, kind of made you want to scream. but its a good job to have to have a job, id choose it over a lot of jobs out there."
good,This is a good company to start your career. Good management team. The job is easy to learn and the training is fair. You learn more on the job. You can move up if you are dedicated.
good,"Very hectic, you learn a lot about prescriptions and insurance. Management is super cool and understanding. Hardest part is being everything to everyone."
good,"A typical day at work is extremely busy which is great because your shift goes by fast.  I learned how to dispense medications, how to order inventory and check insurances.  My manager was very caring, helpful, and patient.  my coworkers were amazing and friendly. the hardest part of the job was keeping the lines short. The best part of the job was helping fill sick patients prescriptions and getting them home as soon as possible so they can start feeling better."
good,Was always treated as an equal an always given hour's. I was never discriminated against and the only thing I'd have to say is there a good times when there wasn't enough power when the holidays would come
good,Greet and assist customers to meet their health and shopping needs. Great opportunity to develop customer service skills. The management has been great to work with.
good,"Enjoyed interacting everyday with the public as well as the regular customers and patients."
good,"Customers are great, pricing of all drugs in all the United States is not sustainable. This puts a strain and stress on the health care system. A challenging but very doable occupation, have to put on your gameface for the more challenging positions."
good,Great people make this Omnicare location a pleasant place to work. The recently renovated  building makes for a nice comfortable working environment. Conveniently located on the west side of Spartanburg.
good,Easy people to get along with and work beside.  Worked with insurance companies and help  patient. Filled prescriptions and worked along with the pharmacist.
good,"Working with CVS taught me a lot of things with regards with handling patients medications and needs. Proper handling and dinpensing their medications is a must in this kind of job. It also gave me an oppotunity to understand patients moods and sickly conditions and taught me to be patient, nice and considerate to our elderly citizens."
good,I enjoy the working with the staff and the job coaches. the managers treat me with respect and I like that because people see my disability but not my skills.
good,"Stable work environment, very fast pace work, there was always something to do, at all times flexible scheduling. tones are room for growth professionally, personally, and financially."
good,"I loved working for Connections through CVS pharmacy helpdesk. My employees were very nice, they help me when I needed help and everyone worked as a team."
good,"A typical day at CVS includes working at different stations throughout the day including: data entry, filling prescriptions and answering phones, and retail customer service. I have worked at multiple locations when I have moved because of school, or because of the military. There is only one position available as management, and you must have years of full time work to become a lead technician. The workplace is always hectic, but respectable. The hardest part of the job would be rude and unhappy patients. I have enjoyed this job because of the good patients, and allowing me to get a great background in healthcare."
good,"Provided friendly customer service with both face to face and telephone contacts at prescription drop-off and pick-up counters."
good,"Exciting to place to work, very busy business, nice and hardworking empolyees, day consists of filling prescriptions, putting away prescriptions,greeting and assisting customers who are either picking up prescriptions or dropping them off to be filled, dealing with health insurances,etc"
good,"CVS Pharmacy is a great starter for the medical field. However, don't expect help from management. Rely on your peers. The pay isn't great. There are full-time benefits, but management will do anything to keep you from being able to access them. No room to move in the company. However, getting the license through the company is a plus."
good,"i enjoyed working here. The company overall is a good company. It is a great place to work for entry level experience. The hardest part of the job would be the constant workflow, but it also helps you build character."
good,Working in a pharmacy you learn to have patience working with co workers and customers. If matters can't work out in your manger hands for a customer there's nothing wrong going out your way to make that customer day
good,"CVS Caremark is the leading mail order pharmacy.  It is really a very nice place to work, but there was little room for advancement. The management was also a bit impersonal and did not value their enployees"
good,"I have loved getting to know my customers. Not just remembering their names and maybe their birthdays but getting to know their lives and creating a personal relationship with them. I love being able to contact their doctor, insurance, another pharmacy, etc. and resolving any issues that may occur. I like knowing they can rely on me to get things straightened out."
good,"A typical day at work would be arriving at work at 2:30 p.m. clock in by 2:50 p.m. go to a floor meeting for 10 minutes and then it's off to work. Get orders from board and pick orders sent over from the CVS pharmacy stores in the district area. Put in tote, zip tie it and place on to the conveyer belt. I learned how to pick the pace and how orders are shipped to different store. I was supervised by the shift supervisor and he was very helpful whenever needed. My co-workers and I all understand the duties and the expectations we had to meet every day while working at the distribution center. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming to work Monday through Friday and being able to work full time."
good,"I usually worked the night shift, so I'd clock in from 3-10pm. A list of daily tasks are laid out, such as: Planograms (reworking of items on the shelves), out of dates (dairy, lotions, food, infant aisle), checking books/magazines in, working out overstock, price changes, scanning out damages/product withdrawals. That'd be a pretty busy day, but most of the time, the tasks are distributed between the morning and night shifts. I have to manage the front, which includes: Ringing customers up (check out), show customers to items, and look after the photo department (the duties were merged over time). "
good,"I would have loved to stay at CVS Caremark. I was a temporary employee. Some of the permanent employees would never let us ""temps"" forget it. That is the only downfall of this employer."
good,"opportunities to move around, dwells on cleanliness and customer service. each location is different some stores run better than others depends heavily on management."
good,"What i learned from working at cvs is that its very competitve , your avaliability should be open, and always follow the policy."
good,I love working for CVS. The company really loves it's employees. Some of the Management team should return to training.
good,This was a great place to work. The management was awesome. It introduced me to the pharmacy world.
good,High volume call center support.  Great place to work but pay wasnt very good.
good,Enjoyed being able to assist customers with questions about their medications or medical supplies.
good,Learned about the different laws that restricted medication and the different effects both adverse and expected. I also learned about different conditions and when to use certain meds and when not to.
good,"A typical day at work included working the register, filling prescriptions, speaking to insurance companies and dealing with customers. Overall, it is a pleasant place to work. My co-workers are nice and easy to work with. The hardest part of this job is not having a normal schedule every week as it changed on a weekly basis."
good,"I was able to meet a variety of people on a daily basis. I learned how to deal with different personalities, by dealing with the customers as well as my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was not being able to provide every customer with the products that they were looking for."
good,"A typical day consists of multitasking between excellent customer service, data input of RX's, counting medications properly, drive-thru duties in a timely manner and handling all insurance issues that arise."
good,I enjoyed the fast pace of the position and enjoyed working with others.
good,"very easy, basic, pharmacy job.   very clean, very nice people, generous bosses that were kind and considerate.   probably one of the best places ive ever worked."
good,"A typical day would include picking and packing medications as well as answersing calls and filling scripts to ensure that all long and short term care patients got their medication in a timely but fast paced manner."
good,"I liked my Job, wish I had more training. The hardest part of the job was to keep customers happy."
good,"CVS is a great place to work, their are very clean and organized. They have on the job training. The only thing they could do differently would be the pay scale."
good,"management wasn't productive at all. the job was amazing, surroundings were great. work ethic was not too fluent. disorganized. but overall a great place to work"
good,Good compensation--No advancement---Good people
good,i enjoyed working at cvs had nice flexable hours good pay && co-workers were very outgoing & easy to get along with. ki excelkled to pharmacy manager after a short year working with them and enjoyed it daily
good,"As a cashier and parttime employee for CVS I would stock, assistant customers and management on different task through out the day around the store. Co-workers would work with me and assistant with other customers add the register."
good,"For the short time I work for CVS, I really enjoyed working. The people were very friendly. The store was also very clean and my co-workers were a great group of people to work with"
good,"I loved my manager, and most of my co workers.. I loved the fact I was able to take over ordering and organizing the cards, that and working the photo lab was most enjoyable to me."
good,"I've been in a ""temporary"" position at a corporate office under Adecco for almost 5 years. The most unfortunate part of it is that my position will never become permanent. The main problem is because of the corporate company's stubbornness/vague explanation. They say their ""budget"" does not allow for the position to be a permanent one. What it truly is (as I have been told directly by my manager at that company) is because the company is just taking advantage of the opportunity given to them. That opportunity is having that position around permanently but because of the work, they are allowed to label it ""temporary"" and hire someone new every 3-6 months. However, I have been here for over 4 years and it's only because I'm great at what I do and keep my work consistant. I'm sure my manager also likes the idea of no longer having to retrain a new person every 3-6 months. I rated the Copensation / Benefits 2 stars because I started off at $12/hr and have received 3 raises since I started 4 years ago. I currently make $13/hr. Also, I am only allowed just 1 paid vacation day and I only get it if I build up 600-800 hours without taking any other time off. I believe all of this is absolutely fair if someone is working for only 3-6 months and/or if they work part time, or even if they are working full time but the work is not very difficult/time consuming. Having the attendance record I do, as well as being told by other co-workers in my department (who are permanent) that I have much more work than they do, it really is unfortunate that I am where I'm at compensation-wise. The reason"
good,Always seeking what is best for customers
good,"As a help Desk Pharmacy Inbound Call Center i evaluate every prescription to be denied or authorized. Working as a team we have a quick response and better place job, every days was verry challenging."
good,I enjoyed my assignment (through a temp agency) very much working at CVS Caremark. But there was a lot of high turn over.
good,learned alot at this job and loved the training I received. People were great to work with
good,"i enjoyed my job, the challenges i faced everyday kept my mind busy, i enjoy fixing problems."
good,I love working in Hospitality because I love to help people and being a team member love helping customers and having a conversation with them to put a smile on there face
good,Helping out the elderly find products actually taking them to the item not pointing on what isle it was on an helping them make a decision on what was best for them for there monies
good,"Very professional as well as very organized. Super friendly, open early,things get done in a timely manner, always very thorough consultations, great system"
good,"Good place to work, first level of management is great. Store manager, store and pharmacy staff excellent and easy to work with. Like a family, everyone was there if you needed help or back-up."
good,worked in the retail support center. With 10000 retail stores volume can be a little bit over whelming at times. Over all its good job for people just starting out in the field you get experiance with alot of different issues and technologies very quickly.
good,The members have a lot of complaints and it makes it really hard on the care Representatives. You have to meet a deductible before you get any financial assistance or copays on prescriptions.
good,Working at CVS is great. I believe we truly stand by our purpose and Management always assigns work with our values in mind. It's been great to witness this recent transition.
good,It was a great place to work I enjoyed working for CVS my job title was a cashier but I had other duties such as stocking the cooler the environment was friendly
good,There is a great level of team work in the pharmacy setting. It was a pleasant work environment to work in. The managers made an effort to work with scheduling and accommodate needs.
good,"I had a great time working for CVS , I enjoyed going to work everyday meeting with my customers, and my co-workers .They give you a chance to organize and adept and prioritizing your daily tasks."
good,"Work hard, play hard with a very diverse group of people. Everyone works together well especially in light of all the things to be done. If you get the opportunity to work with CVS Health, I would definitely take the journey."
good,Loved my job. Work was tedious but kept me busy at all times. I would definitely go back to this employer because of the pay and how family friendly they are.
good,This was my first job fresh out of high school and I have loved every second of it! I became a supervisor in 2017 so I had to become full-time! Finding balance in my private life has been hard but I love all of my coworkers! My boss is amazing at working with my school schedule!
good,"A typical day consists of covering all front end duties, including point of sale and photo counter. For me, the most enjoyable part of the job is that I have worked with great people throughout my time there.The most difficult part of the job is being spread thinly due to completing concerns throughout the day."
good,"A typical day at CVS consists of working multiple tasks at once. You expected to do your main task of the day such as production or drop off and work the register and drive though on top of that. I have learned to shift my full attention from my main task to another task and be able to shift back without loosing track of either task. Even though there is multiple tasks happening at the same time the workplace environment helps. If you are in need in one area another technician will step up to help. The hardest part of the job is communicating to the patient why their medications are not filled when they need them. Most of the time it is hard to explain that a lot of factors goes into filling their prescriptions, The best part of the jobs is helping the patients become healthier."
good,My experience w the company should have lasted longer. However I believe that certain management are selective in who the promote off the grid of job based merit. I was a top achiever in my training class since day 1. Unfortunately I was put on a probation on my birthday with out being coached to it prior.  Their was not even a warning they jumped immediately to a written notice. Following that I had minimal cot w my then supervisor. Jeannie Durban is in my opinion very chatty over email but in person she seems duplicitous.
good,Fast-paced environment.  Learned so much working for a large corporation and able to master skills. CVS is a good place to work because there is so much changing all the time and gave me the opportunity to learn so many different things.
good,"I love working for CVS Health. It offers lots of growth opportunities. However, I would like the compensation to match what we do so we don’t have to seek additional income and can focus on further growth."
good,"worked Pharmacy Technician as an internship, Assisted patients during drop off or pick up prescriptions, Directed patients when needed over the counter medications"
good,"A very nice place to work, except for the fact that they pay 11/hr. Other than that it's friendly place a also you will get a discount on cvs store products."
good,"would def. work there again but morning shifts , no closing shifts they seem the longest ! but yes people should apply as customer service / manager / pharmacist (:"
good,The company is good to work for except when it comes to a disagreement between a customer and employee even when the employee follows policy the company tends to side with the customer no matter how outstanding a performer the employee was with little to no investigation in the matter. Any customer who has a vendetta for whatever reason can fire a complaint even a false one and get your job terminated.
good,"Management was friendly and caring in my case they worked with me regarding my schedule but the pay raise was an issue, been working there for 4 years and still didnt get what I deserved."
good,"Helping people on their path to health is our motto. I enjoy helping our customers and answering any questions concerning their medications, insurance issues and co-pays. I also love to put a smile on a customers face, that does not have insurance in which I can get them the lowest discount price possible."
good,"I have the most wonderful co-workers!! they make the extremely busy pharmacy workload bearable. I know when I'm working, we are absolutely a team. We all take the care of our customers very seriously."
good,"CVS has given me a great opportunity to be a part of a Fortune 50 company.  I enjoy being a technician, I just wish the culture at my pharmacy was different."
good,CVS is a fast faced and demanding work environment.  The benefits are good.  You definitely work for the money you are paid.
good,Daily tasks include refiling medication contacting pharmacy and educating members on plan information. ordering medication and setting up mail order or pharmacy locations for members following policy and procedures as set up by plan design.
good,"This job requires you to be focused and on your toes, because you are timed to perform your task at 100%. You are given a order to place product in a tote. If you like shopping then this is just the same as shopping. The co workers are very friendly, management listened here and there, my only issue that I always addressed was safety, which they didn't take in consideration at times. After my probation(3months) they saw how fast and accurate I was they let me train the new hires(which I did 75people with only one that didn't pass). What people found stressful was the way they were timed. Such as the location that they would put you in didn't have enough totes, and yet you still had to meet the time given(such as given 4minutes to fill a order and having to go further down to get totes in a timely and safe matter) Something that I agreed on but still performed my job the way that they wanted. I focus on safety on all of my jobs and want the job I work for to be as safe for the employees and for the company."
good,"A typical day at CVS consisted of greeting and checking out costumers. When the costumers needed help, we would guide them to what they were looking for. I also stocked and removed outdated products in the store and at the end of the shift there was daily night cleaning that had to be done."
good,Work environment is stress free. Yields the best productive results . And also encourages any new inputs from the employees to improve and enhance the productivity.
good,"very stressful yet rewarding job, there is always a lot going on so its never boring, but very quick paced and long process on becoming a pharmacy technician."
good,"Work well with a team and serve the community. Its very rewarding. The place has its pros and cons. One of the big things is you need to be able to handle criticism. From time to time, angry customer will let you know how they are feeling."
good,"I enjoyed working for Coram. It was fast paced with the demands from case managers to discharge patients and have enteral supplies set up. I loved how busy I was. The days flew by! But management was overly stressed due to being understaffed so they kind of ""checked out"" and you were left on your own. The biggest downfall was there were always changes in procedures and management was bad about training for that then punishing you for making mistakes. But it's good job security because they can't find people to stick it out very long so they won't fire you. I loved this job because I enjoy the challenges, but wouldn't go back unless they had a better system in place."
good,"The managers will always work with you. If you have fallen on hard times, and/or are having problems with transportation, sickness, family wellness... they will help as long as they know that you are genuine and are a hard worker. Other than that, I think the pay could go up $2 or more and there is not much room to move around to other departments or to move up from the typical pharmacy technician position."
good,CVS is a great place for new pharmacists and technicians to work in order to get the feel of the job requirements. It is also a great place for high school teenagers to get their feet wet in the working environment.
good,I worked part time at CVS while  during my last year in high school. it wasn't stressful at all and you could always count on a manager to help you when things get busy.
good,Health care is changing to be to metric and no passion like it was .Need more compassion and love for the patients like in the beginning when I first started with this company when it was not corporate
good,"i learned how to cooperate with people, it was always easy to restock shelves and take out out-dates, there wasn't really a hardest part expect restocking items in a timely fashioned"
good,"you better be ready to hit the ground running. but that's a good thing, there are a series of opening (the pharmacy) tasks that need to get done right away. then you refer to the workstation board to see what your assignment for the day is. you will be continuously busy accommodating customers, typing up new Rxs, filling Rxs, etc."
good,"Typical day is taking care of benefit information for patients, and adhering to customer service, I have learned to focus, and workplace if friendly hardest part is wanting to learn more I enjoy the warm atmosphere"
good,"very busy pharmacy but i loved the challenges that brought on for my day, it helped the day pass quickly as i stayed focused on my work all day. The pharmacy team was like a little family and we worked really well together."
good,This is an establish and well known company that has promotional opportunities. Depending on the area  in which you would like to go into this company can be a great company to work for.
good,The job itself was okay. There was not much opportunity for advancement. This job was part-time so it did not offer benefits. I enjoyed the people and customers.
good,I enjoyed the staff and learning experience I received while doing my internship there.  This was a fast paced environment which I enjoyed as it helped the time to go by fast.
good,Working with CVS Health was a great learning experiece. It is a fast paced job that requires your full attention. If you are looking to excel in a career then becoming a part of the CVS Health team is where you want to be.
good,A good place to work for a consultant pharmacist. The day to day involves traveling to different long-term care facilities and providing excellent customer service while ensuring regulatory compliance.
good,It is a very busy place that deals with people in a very fast paced environment. You have to be able to multi-task. You learn a lot of information in a very fast pace.
good,"For years, Coram suffered from financial distress due to poor management and market conditions."
good,Very organized business that places an emphasis on customer service and requires good interpersonal communication skills.
good,The company is a good place to work for - typical mix of professionals and first time employees. Good benefits and culture. Very engaged with their staff and employees
good,The people I work with in the pharmacy are nice. The company in general does not really care about you. The benefits are bad and you have to work 6 months of full time hours before you can get benefits.
good,"When working at CVS, I was a college student. They were always very flexable with my schedule, and understanding if I had a school related activity."
good,"Long days but i can say great friendly people, with working at this job i learn the true meaning of customer service. There where so many different type of attitude to deal with at a fast paste."
good,Great company to work for but are relocating to another state. Management was great to work for and it was like family for 8 years. Sorry to be leaving
good,"Duties for morning shift included checking all safety hazard, spoiled milk, and counting change drawers to start the shift as well as the safe. BOH scans (balance on Hand) while cashier checks out customers and help when cashier needs it."
good,I really enjoyed how involved the supervisors were. The training was very good too. The supervisors were very active in trying to help out their employees.
good,A great opportunity to learn about the medical field and how to talk to people who are sick and going through a rough time.
good,"I began my career here at CVS in Washington NC, as a pharmacy technician to help me remember the prescription medications for our local community. The hardest part of the job was seeing our older generation not be able to afford their medications because insurance would not cover it or a sick baby and the parents had no insurance.  I learned a lot of PATIENCE and being able to communicate effectively as well as being humble enough to take one for the team.  When something went wrong or a customer was upset, i apologized and assisted them in the best way possible."
good,"customer service is a must , no matter how evil a customer show them the most respect. help the customer get in and out of the store as happy as you can."
good,coram is a great place to learn new things and to start a career. they take very good care of the employees and the patients. it can get very high paced and get out of control at times. if you are passionate about helping others this is the job for you. management is great as well.
good,Staff will teach you anything that you don't know or understand. Fast paced. Fun filled days and evenings.
good,"Good company to work for, great chance of progression, friendly management who are always wanting to get the best out of you"
good,CVS Health allowed me to gain experience I did not have before. Company had great benefits and PTO available to employees.
good,I learned a great deal of things working for this company. Their online training for Pharmacy Technician was wonderful and very helpful. Hardest part of the job was no breaks other than that it was a good experience.
good,"It was a Big Project, i was involved in many phases of the SDLC, job Environment was ok. Developers were more helpful than anyone else."
good,"was very demanding hard to take time off. needed more employees. but I really loved my pharmacist and my co workers, and the wonderful customers."
good,thankful for the experience to start out my career at CVS and hope to be able to return in the future and build a great relationship.
good,"While CVS Health is a leader in Pharmacy Benefit Plan administration, it has proven to be only a decent employer. Much talk is given about work/life balance however, that is only if that balance doesn't interfere with company goals. "
good,A decent place to work for. Good benefits. Friendly employees. They try really hard for good customer service. Very busy store.
good,It is a fast paced environment. Well all learned from each other if an problem occurred. We have a management team that is supportive as well as understand if there is an emergency. Of course with this company a lot goes around the corporate office and they do offer the employees to give feedback to see if we can improve certain areas of the company. The best part is working my fellow colleagues as well as meeting and greeting or returning customers as well as new ones that come to our store.
good,"The customers are fantastic! They were appreciative, and were very helpful in trying to be a part of the solution to the problems."
good,My first job!!! Thanks to the ex pharmacy manager that used to worked there I learned everything for my career. We had a nice team.
good,"Your day here at cvs is not your average day, you can not predict how your day will unfold. There is not a lot of down time so if you fall behind on production its going to take a lot of team work to catch back up and keep the mood in a great and happy atmosphere. My team here is really great, they always try their best to lend a hand if they feel its needed and as a team we dominate the day. From a customers point of view it looks like a normal calm day but behind the counter were 7-8 pages in on production making sure each prescription is filled in time for the patients as they wanted. Id say the hardest part of the job is closing and the reason i say that is because when it comes closing time we have a few people or prescription that have not been picked up yet and wed like to wait a little to see if they would make it before we have to close. The most enjoyable part is the smiling faces we see on a daily/weekly/monthly that come in and appreciate our connection and conversations."
good,"First Pharmacy job, love everything about it. I first started out as a cashier in the front end of the store, was move to the back Pharmacy, learn a lot of information, that I still use today as an instructor."
good,A typical day at work for me was very well worth getting up and going too. I learned a lot over my years with working for Medicare part D. I enjoyed all of my co-workers and there really was no hard part of my day. I enjoyed everything about my job.
good,Its a good place to start your career. Challenging work area with somestimes get overload but nice place to learn something new every day
good,"A typical day for me was filling Prescriptions, getting the pill deliveries and working on the computer. There was a half an hour lunch break, which was good because there's a lot of stores in the area."
good,"It is very multitasking job. attention to detail, be able to stand of feet for a while. you don't leave always when your shift is over. schedule is three weeks in advance"
good,7 years and then a department lay off ended what I feel would have been the place that I would retire from 1 day.
good,"Work independently and in a team environment"
good,A typical day at work is always on the move. I have learned how to communicate with customers that are anger and upset. The management is good but could be a lot better. The co-workers are great.
good,A very easy job to have as a second job. The store is never really that busy.
good,7 day cycles 9 hour shifts.  7 days on 7 days off until CVS decided to reduce the number of 24 hour stores and layoffs occurred.  Hard to find quality resources that wanted to work over night.
good,"A typical day during my externship at CVS pharmacy was very busy. I would fill prescriptions, use pharmacy computers, assist customers over the phone, check in shipments and rotate stock as necessary. I learned what a real life pharmacy environment was like as opposed to simply being in the classroom. My co-workers were wonderful and supportive as was management. The hardest part of the job was the knowledge that if I were to make a mistake I could seriously injure someone and have to live with that fact for the rest of my life. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I was making a contribution to the community by helping to keep people well in times of ill health."
good,A patient passed/collapsed by the drop off counter. I offered help immediately.
good,my typical day at work is great nice coworkers and fun environment and love helping customers
good,"I have enjoyed working for Omnicare there have many opportunities for help from my co-workers and certain upper management, unfortunately I am looking for more of a challenge and I do not feel as though I am full filling my my full potential in life working with a Company doing what I am doing at the present time."

good,"cleaning "
good,Great company and management. Very laid back but professional. great customers.

good,"This company has now closed. However, it was a great place to work."
good,"A typical day at work was very fast-paced at times, there was always customers in the store needing help. I learned, from working as a customer service rep, how to handle many different situations with customers. We would have some that were very displeased and upset, and i learned how to deal with their behavior in a professional way. Some of my co-workers at CVS were excellent teammates who would always be there for me if i needed an extra hand or wasn't 100% sure about something. The hardest part of this job was dealing with returns, especially if the customer did not have a receipt with them. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with so many different people. Most of the customers were extremely polite which made it very easy for me to communicate with them. I loved that part of the job"
good,A typical work day is being in a fast paced environment to ensure the Clients and members are satisfied. I've learned numerous department handlings in my 13 years of being with the company.
good,providing excellent customer service and helping patients
good,Picked merchandise from shelves put them in bins and shipped them out to stores. I enjoyed working 3rd shift or graveyard shift because it kept me on my toes I moves faster and my co-workers were very friendly and helpful. I was hard keeping up with the clock since every store had to be picked within a matter of minutes or seconds to meet your quota. I enjoyed it anyway.
good,Going in early in the morning. Greeting my manager and asked how he was doing. Listening to request and maintaining multitasks. Assistance with customers.
good,CVS is a great company to work for the wages should have been a little more for the work expected of me and the management was not always friendly
good,"I love this company, and there are a lot of opportunities within the company. I don't like the management staff at the location where I work."
good,"Typical Day @ Work- I would clock in and start the day by addressing our pharmacist and co-workers. I would start my day by pulling prescriptions overdue for pick-up, filing away the new prescriptions, handling the customers for pick-ups for counter and drive thru, entering doctor's prescriptions, and stocking shelves as well as pulling expired medications."
good,This was on of the best learning experience there are lots of room for advancement.
good,"A typical day at work included me working in the pharmacy until about 2 p.m., then i would go across the street to manage our mobility center."
good,This company has too many intiatives for their understaffing policy.
good,• Collect and enter data into the pharmacy information system as directed.
good,"If you work hard and follow your training, you can move up quicky. But its hard works and lots of hours. Don't expect good work/Life Balance but the reward can pay off."
good,I enjoyed the fast pace of filling prescriptions and the interaction with the customer.
good,"typical day was expect the unexpected and solved the problem .worked with agency, staff took me in as one of their own helped me with things I didn't know. Encourage me move forward."
good,"Cvs is a fun place to work. It is a fast paced environment with continous on the job training, always keeping my skills current and fresh."
good,"it was fun and so busy, i learned so much there, very flexiable hours"
good,it was a fast paced work environment that had alot of diverse people who all brought alot of good attributes to the company
good,To obtain a challenging position in which my work experience and educational background can be utilized allowing personal and professional growth.
good,"Rules are the rules at Caremark, so if you are an individual, dont apply. The training for Customer Service Reps is top notch, and the support is as well, however, the Customer Service supervisors unfortunately are hired only for their paper degrees and not for their business sense. If they trained them the same way they trained the Reps, the company would be excellent in all categories. If you are ""politically"" correct, you will go far. They do treat the Reps in an outstanding fashion in every area except pay. Overall a great place to work, just keep your head down and follow the rules."
good,"For the most the customers are great. It's slow most of the time so you're able to get your work done. Management is understanding, helpful, and fair."
good,"Very busy, you work a lot of over time here most of the time, especially during the the holidays, the hardest part I’d say about this job is making sure you go fast to reach the goal of the day."
good,I enjoyed working at CVS. I was taught a lot and had many promotion opportunities. The hardest part of the job was being able to complete all tasks in a shift. The most enjoyable part was working with the customers and an amazing team.
good,"Learned something new every day as healthcare job requires rules and regulations and problem solving technique."
good,"Never fill out an ""anonymous"" review of a company you've worked for while trying to fill out a job profile online.  Your feedback can be used against you at worst and serve you zero benefit at best."
good,Great company if you are in college or just starting out. They make it difficult to have a work/life balance especially for working moms. Upper management is great.
good,"A typical day at CVS was giving customers positive service, understanding what was needed and how to ensure that everyone left with a one-call solution"
good,The job was great and I would refer other to work there as well. The customers are the best as well as the learning opportunities. Management could get better.
good,"I worked in a store that was open 24 hours and working the overnight shift was great. However, management changed and made it very difficult to stay. The new manager acted like he didn't like woman (cultural thing) and harassed me to no end. I had to leave. The best part of my job were the customers. I got to see some of the same people almost every day and they were a delight!! They made me come out of my comfort zone and be more direct with people."
good,"Typical day at work come in and provide customer service, had a routine on the daily tasks to do, I was learning to becoming a pharmacy technician, management was very within a circle if you werent part of that friend circle you were just someone who just work there, there was no workplace culture, the most enjoyable part of my job was the customers and my staff, we completed tasks as a team and we help each other out"
good,"I enjoyed my years spent at store 8025, but when management changes hands four times in three years , there is a breakdown of the team and everyone suffers. Employees and customers."
good,I love working there  I  gave them 9 years but once they started hiring new employees making more than the old employees I had to find a better paying job
good,I enjoy working here.  The people/coworkers are easy to understand and get along with.   Everyone wants to help.  I only wish I could get more hours on the schedule.
good,CVS  Caremark is a great place to work . It works very hard to stay on task in order to provide great customer service and to make the work environment a safe place.
good,"Fast pace enviroment work. One can learn a lot if first time as intern."
good,"CVS is a rough workplace for anyone who wants a desk job, management included. You will spend most of your time on the floor and dealing with customers as your focus, mired by over reach from corporate wanting to squeeze every minute out of your they can. However, the store management is usually very understanding, cooperative, and helpful. They have experienced a lot and can give you the answers you need. There is also ample room for advancement if you have the drive and are willing to do what you have to."
good,"It’s a good start does keep you on your feet with stuff to do but doesn’t give enough hours , closes early so there’s no over time the hours you get is the hours you get but will call you in even if you’re not on the schedule"
good,"As a pharmacy student, CVS pharmacy allows full time students to get part-time experience at the convenience of their schedules. In addition, managers are open to allowing Pharmacy interns to gain leadership experience and management insights."
good,a family environment and a great feeling of family that really looked our for and helped each other both professionally and personally.  I felt real loss when I changed stores
good,"La acest loc de munca mi-a placut ca am putut ajuta cat si aduce schimbare in bine in viata beneficiarilor. A fost o slujba plina de provocari, dar si plina de semnifcatie."
good,Cvs pharmacy was a good place to work.  The only thing bad was they did not offer any overtime at all and I wad offered another job with overtime every wéek.  The opportunity to make more money was in manufacturing.
good,"Long term care facility experience"
good,"CVS was one of the best jobs I ever had.  They matched you with the 401K.  Right off the bat, you received 12 PTO days after training.  you also received 1 week vacation after 6 months.  Their was always room for advancement.  If you didn't have a bad attandenancem you were able to work at home.  Best of all, COFFEE WAS FREE!!"
good,a typical day it was never the same always something new to try and solve i love a good challenge. the management was young inexperienced they were understaffed and poorly managed
good,"I really enjoy working for CVS. I love all my coworkers and the customers. It is a very high traffic store with not much down time. I dont mind as i have to stay busy. "
good,"Depending on the time of the day, all you're doing if ringing up customers and occasionally stocking/cleaning. Nothing too stressful or hard was given, everything was completely doable. Managers were kind, calm, and understanding."
good,I will come and work on my report everything was already set to work very peaceful we all get along my team very warm and happy place to work more like family .. very sad not to be there we were all laid off since the office relocated to phoenix Arizona.. but if I had the chance again I will work for them on what I really enjoyed doing
good,"CVS Pharmacy gave me the skills I needed to become a proficient Pharmacy Technician. Management at the Mt Carmel PA branch are awesome. Very helpful, and professional. Only left cause I had to relocate, but working with CVS really opened many doors for opportunity in the Pharmacy path."
good,CVS does not pay very high for the work that is expected from you.  They have a mediocre training program.  Their benefits are about average.  Working conditions very from day to day.  They have a high rate of turnover due to low pay.
good,"Filling prescriptions, filling shelves with new stock, assisting customers. Enjoyed the team I worked with, the pharmacist not so much. He was kind of arrogant and in my opinion talked down to the techs."
good,"CVS Pharmacy is a great entry- level job into customer service. The work is fasted pace, management was great and showed appreciation for their employees."
good,This is a great position. You get to sit down all day answering calls and scheduling orders. If you love being a Pharmacy Tech then you would enjoy it.
good,It started out as a great place to work then new management came in looking to replace people. They became uncaring about their employees health. But it was a good job.
good,CVS is okay if you're desperate. The job in itself is fine except a little stressful but that's what I expected being a pharmacy tech at a retail store. The hours are terrible and it was like being on call when I wasn't. Shifts have to be picked up all the time and hours are constantly cut. My managers were awesome.
good,"At times it could be very busy and you would be working on 50 thing at once, but if you had a good team of  employees, we would work together and get everything done.  Down side, they only have 1 full time Pharmacy tech and our store. Therefore, no benefits, no paid time off, no vacation. sometime your were lucky if you received 20 hours a weeks."
good,Really enjoyed my opportunity with CVS specialty was definitely one of the best jobs I've had and that I really enjoyed. The supervisor I had was awesome and the company provide good training and great benefits.
good,"Learned something new every day.  My job involved every department so my day was a bi different every day. Worked with the nurses every day, however on different councils and committees I was able to grow and learn all aspects of the company and our division."
good,"I have been hired as a contract employee.  However, I would really like to stay here at the Scottsdale AZ Corporate offices.  My manager is fantastic!  He truly cares about the well being of each and every employee.  The most enjoyable part of the job is getting positive feedback for a job well done!  In my experience there was ample time for training and coworkers were very helpful and available for questions.  "
good,I want to go to work and be appreciated there not be verbally abused by my boss. I want to have a nice relaxing environment. Other than the boss in Florida I have enjoyed working for CVS.
good,The surrounding people are great and sense of privacy with great cubicle space. Micro managed but it does have a great cafeteria and huge eating area.
good,I enjoy working for this company. There are some great leaders here. I've learned a lot in under a year in the insurance field. Also this position gives you an advantage to go into any other position within the company.
good,I would recommend the company if you have a flexible schedule snd no life and can devote countless hours to working this this may ne the career or job for you
good,"A normal day at CVS is filling prescriptions, answering phones, printing prescriptions instructions and checking customers out. A busy day. Once you clock in its like you're going full speed none stop."
good,"I assisted the Business Development Manager.  Answering his phone calls.  I arranged travel for my boss and the sales team.  Coordinated meetings including catering and scheduling conference rooms. I arranged conference rooms for the sales team. Assisted the sales team with marketing materials."
good,"I worked their over a couple of year they are cheap and want you to do all this work, plenty of days we were short, the pharmacist work long hours without break."
good,Very happy with CVS. I unfortunately had to leave because I was unable to stand 8 to 12 hours a day on concrete due to a car accident at the age of 14
good,The Customers was Great at My Location Where i was at. the staff was very friendly and welcoming as well. I Enjoy working for this comapny and how the advancement is here
good,"I learned about Medicare guidelines and software systems used to determine eligibility."
good,"Trained and supervised new employees, ensuring they maintain fastidious attention to detail."
good,Good place to work to get your foot in the door. I just don't want it to be the place I stay as a career. My management is wonderful which halps and makes it harder to move on.
good,I was only working part time during college as I attended part time and was a single mother raising 2 children. I only worked part time and did not receive any benefits
good,"great place to work, really nice coworkers. I worked in a store in San Diego and it was a really nice store and i enjoyed working there. The pay was nice"
good,"Working for CVS I was able to advance somewhat, a typical day there involved all things inventory, shipping receiving, returns etc.  A lot of attention to detail most with data entry.  Fixed insurance issues and stayed in contact with physicians offices.  The toughest part of the job was the lack of fellow employees on staff, we are always short handed which typically triples the workload for certain individuals such as myself who have more experience.  The most rewarding part of the job was being able to help those who needed help."
good,"CVS pharmacy was a great company to work for. I started at the pharmacy with no experience and was trained in multiple area of the job. I worked at pickup, drive-thru, and production (which is where you count and label the medication). I was able to move up through the company."
good,"CVS Health is a great place to work, especially as a first job. Our department has a work/life/balance committee, which I think is rare with corporate America."
good,"Fast paced business with many departments that strive to work together to complete the job. Training is wonderful when it comes from another employee and not the training staff. Management has a large turnover and the new managers often times do not know how to run the machines they are supervising the operation of, and do not take the initiative to learn."
good,"CVS is a great company. This was my first job and I started off as a cashier, then moved to one hour photo manager. By the time I moved on to another career I was a pharmacy tech."
good,"This company is a very great company to work for and I was privileged to have met such fine people to work with, I wouldn't do anything differently. The store is clean and friendly and not to mention all the savings you save when you shop with CVS."
good,I started as a cashier and made my way to Pharmacy Tech. This position definitely got me interested in the sciences. I can still remember all the generic names of the medicines.
good,Filled prescriptions for the pharmacist to verify and cashiered. Got along great with everyone but got into a bad car accident and had to stay home for a while.
good,"I worked in a city location. Always lots to do and with the right managerial team your work will be recognized. No bad things to really say, they move people up reasonably but takes a while."
good,I loved working at cvs. My days flew by due to the high call volume. My supervisor was always trying to better his team and make sure we were cared for as well.
good,It is a good job however the pay in not sufficient for the work. You will be on your feet all day with only two ten minute breaks. You will get experience for future jobs you are interested in.
good,I really enjoyed working with this company. You will work hard and you wil get your 40 hours. During peak season you will work 50 or more hours if desired. there is money to be made with this company if you are willing to put in the time
good,"My overall Work experience at CVS was very pleasant, I Loved working there. My supervisors were reasonable & helpful.My Co Workers were very helpful, & the customers were the best."
good,"Fun and busy place to work with a supportive and understanding management team. The Charlestown CVS Pharmacy was always full of life and energy, both good and bad. I enjoyed working in such a fast paced & efficient environment."
good,"Hires new technicians while training them on the job in a comfortable environment. Training should be very thorough from the very beginning, as opposed to slowly or not at all. I received training but it wasn't as thorough as I'd expected and was very drawn out. I felt as though I had to play catch up to be at a speed that I should've been a lot sooner."
good,"Individual stores are great to work in, typical day is routine in work functions but changes occur in the minute due to the excellence of customer service that needs to be performed"
good,We had the largest volume of customers in the region and there were very few breaks even to grab a bite to eat.  Other than that it was a great place to learn and grow.
good,"You will have fill prescribes, greet customer, answer the phone, and work with insurance. The most important thing at CVS is customer satisfaction. The phone is always going off and drive through is none stop."
good,"During my duration at CVS I've learned lots of things such directing a team, product resets, california price audit and as well as california lotto audits."
good,"The externship I went to was great. The Pharmacist and staff there were excellent. They knew how to handle their business, and it showed when corporate visited the store and found the number to be highly impressive. This was a pharmacy that handled 700-800 prescriptions a day. fast-paced environment but not overwhelming. a great job with great people."
good,Can not really go into much detail but i used to live with the people i looked after. To care for other people in ways that i didn't do before. Management are amazing and really look after their staff. I didn't really have co-workers that i worked with but all the other carers are lovely people. The hardest pert was having to say goodbye as i had to  go look after another person. Knowing i did the best i could to make sure people could still live in their own homes was the most enjoyable
good,"handling money, customer service, on time, working the registers, stocking shelves, intake information in the pharmacy, work the drive through, pull the prescriptions, fill the prescriptions order the meds."
good,Everyone was like family always helping one another out and being great team players always had happy customers.  I was happy coming to work everyday.
good,Answering phones and entering patients information into the system. Management work with you as much as they could. Enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest was the calling patients back and letting them know that I could approve their request and the drive for me. Helping the patients.
good,"Very structured. Fun, fair people to work for, and with. Overall, this was a decent place to work.  I liked the structure of my job."
good,"Fast paced, problem-solving, learned how to deal with insurances, managers and co-workers are fun to be around and make the job enjoyable."
good,"All prescriptions are filled in a timely manner, most customers are required to have insurance, not mandatory but of course it always assist in helping their prescriptions cheaper."
good,perfect place for students to work part time. friendly work environment with good management. great teawwork with co workers
good,"I work at a pharmacy that is considered to be high-volume, meaning we do roughly 2,500 prescriptions a week.  While I am fortunate to have a great boss, sometimes the volume of work that is thrown at me at once can be overwhelming.  The best way to manage the workload is to divide tasks in order of importance.  I have enjoyed working for CVS and hope to continue to work for them for a long time."
good,"Cvs Pharmacy was the most exciting place I have ever worked for their was always competitions in sales between stores and co-workers. I ran the front of the store during the day running the register, assisting customers and maintaining the store. I would stock, clean and assist in closing out registers in the evening. The Management was the most organized and productive i have ever worked for. I was informed the position i had was part time so i was not eligible for benefits and their was no room for advancement."
good,"I learned a lot at cvs. i got so  much experience about customer service, learned about some of the medicine and this job made me more creative."
good,"i enjoyed working at CVS.  You had to keep on your toes because you were always busy with customers and facing the store.  I would still e working at CVS, but there was an unfortunate situation that I will not get into at this time."
good,"Refilling prescription orders and creating new orders when necessary"
good,"Provides ongoing supervision to Customer Service Representative staff"
good,"This place is great if you're going to school, they are able to work with your schedule and provide balance between time at work and home. As a team in general, we are understaffed but we take on work that is meant for two or even three people. The team is always friendly, they're willing to help out if you have questions . The hardest part of the job is the intense volume of customers that visit the store and the abilty to help them as effectively and as fast as possible. The most enjoyable part would be the workload outside of the registers. It's a little more relaxed but still even-paced, You get to interact with people and talk to them and maybe have fun while you're at it."
good,This is a warm environment where we all work together as a team to perform our daily task and promote each other to do our best.
good,"I got along good with my co-works as well as management, we enjoyed ourselves while providing for the customers."
good,"My typical day involved me working in production, which was the fill area. I would pull and fill accurate medications for prescriptions. If the lines for check out were long, would provide back up at the registers in the pharmacy. Did drop off, entering the prescription and SIG for pharmacist's verification. Also worked the drive-thru. Nothing was hard about the job, I enjoyed every aspect of the pharmacy. Although I had minimal experience with insurance verification and prior authorizations, I am on a quest to learn and master all aspects of the pharmacy."
good,Every day I work is just managing the store and seeing what task should be done and giving my coworkers a list of things to do. Seeing if any shelves our empty for i can fill them or order what were missing. I learn everyday about a new product or what i can do better to approve the store. My coworkers our the best were like a feeling they can always talk to me about anything and be honest with me. The hardest part of my job is when my coworkers lie to me or when they do something wrong I have to write them up that is part of my job and i am the manager on duty during that time but i always do my job. The best part of my job is making the customers happy and when they feel comfortable enough to talk to me about private stuff. It feels amazing when the customer leaves happy sometimes they will give me and hug and tell me I'm the happy that is the best feeling ever.
good,"structured, fun place to work. managers are on point! i enjoyed the change in location"
good,I have been in pharmacy business over 30 years and the things I have learned about people can be the most enlightening when working in a place dealing with people.  My management skills is compared to that of a Sargent in the army.  I enjoy working with the staff now as I have in the past years. Remember that no one else should make your day-only you.  The hardest part of this job is the long hours we work 14 hours days during the week and I feel like I'm missing out on home life most times.  The most enjoyable  part of the job is knowing that you helped someone
good,"Same as above, please read the above statement in order to see what was said about the company"
good,The work environment was great. The hardest thing for me was billing insurance companies for medications. My co-workers were great and the customers were enjoyable for the most part. I loved working for the pharmacy department at a 24HR CVS.
good,A typical date working at Coram Healthcare is moderate and your able to work at your own pace through out the day. You will learn everything about the position that you are assigned to in the three different departments. Sometimes management such as supervisor tend to abuse their authority and have attitudes with their team members. Some coworkers are fine but others tend to start drama with others to get some type of entertainment.
good,"I use to love my job as a pharmacy tech, learning about the different prescriptions, handling insurance issues, taking care of the customers, etc... The hours were flexible and my co-workers were friendly. I would say the hardest part was when a large amount of prescriptions came in all at once but it wasn't something my team couldn't handle."
good,I believe that this place helps me a lot to be more patients on those customers that are really mean! Also CVS helps me to learn about medicines and be more respectful.
good,"fast paced large volume of meds sent out daily , i learned to focus and always put out excellence,management is great ,my co workers are are great as well, the hardest part of my job is doing better than the day before  and the most enjoyable part of my job is accomplishing my goal of doing better than the day before."
good,"The job itself is great, its simple, stress free and pretty laid back environment. I wish I could take this job with me, but my home life suffers from the commute :( I have worked at two differant facilities for this company and almost every person I worked with has been nice."
good,"Patients were always patient, fun, and enjoyable to work with. Supervisors and managers were flexible and understanding with sudden schedule changes. Overall one of the best jobs I had."
good,"Ive learned to master in my customer service skills, ive learned to multitask and handle customer solutions at more satisfying matter"
good,"My manager John is very awesome!! He knows how important family is. Anytime he is always there for you.  The team I work with is awesome, we are like 1 big family."
good,A typical day is ringing customers out and keeping everyone organized and well helped.
good,"A typical day working in the pharmacy at CVS is usually pretty busy. Time tends to fly by when you are counting pills, helping customers, and resolving insurance rejections. I love the multitasking part of this job. It allows me to think and to never get bored. There is always something to stay occupied with. The most enjoyable part of working in the pharmacy is getting to know your customers!"
good,"Enjoyed the teamwork this company promotes,"
good,I enjoyed and florished within CVS and wish I had never been recruited to leave

good,great palce to be employed by.my co -wokers are great as far as getting alone with each other.
good,CVS/Caremark is a very good place to work. They work to improve employee experiences in their career.
good,"My experience with the company has been a learning experience. Cvs Caremark Co. a platform where i learned and established a strong career. Throughout my career time at CVS I learned different aspects of business, Managment, Recruiting, Training as well as Inventory Management."
good,"Extremely busy as this is a pharmacy. The staff were personable and fun to work together, but also professional. This position was a part time and I worked here only a short time, so I was not able to move up and place myself into a full time position or receive the benefits offered."
good,"i am a pharmacy tech. with cvs for the past 9 years. i enjoyed how i was trusted to make decisions on my own and didn't have someone constantly watching me. however, the focus on KPM and misc. other daily and weekly reports, i find take away the attention to customer service which is to be our core value."
good,Verifying/reverifying insurance
good,This job was professional but fun work environment for their workers included fun Fridays special treat days and celebrating holidays rather it was giving back to the kids on Christmas or giving out candy on Halloween
good,There is always room for advancement. You can start off as a stock person and end up working in the pharmacy. They send you for the training.
good,"CVS is a large corporate pharmacy, but the individual Pharmacists and staff at the stores are wonderful people who really care about the customers they work with."
good,"For eleven years, I have advocated for optimal pharmaco-economic healthcare with both patients and physicians in my role as a Clinical Consultant Pharmacist with Caremark, America's largest PBM. Through this position, I have been able to use clinical, and analytical skills along with genuine compassion to advance pharmacy practice while accomplishing my ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes."
good,"its super fast and they are more concerned over quantity verses quality...once your error rate is up, they want you to slow down to make quality better then it kills your quantity picking rate."
good,I did the same thing every day. On Wednesday was load days where we put the inventory away. I learn how to deal with customers when they were rude and how to give great customer service skills. management was not fair at all. co-workers where great some.
good,"Great workplace, would recommend, I have learned alot working there, they are very good at recognizing employees for good job done, they are very accommodating to the employees that are showing interest in there job,"
good,CVS offers good benefits including vacation and insurance. Clean working environment and treat their employees well. Nice employee discounts and great thorough pharmacy staff.
good,The manager was very friendly and usually unsterstood if you needed help with things you didn’t know  they are always very helpful in all cvs stores around
good,I loved working here.  I loved the independence of working independently yet having support immediately available by phone.  Excellent clinical practice guidelines and resources.  Sometimes store employee can be strange.
good,It's good It can be a lot of work and truck is a lot but most of all the job can be easy to do and also you have to keep in mind that sometimes you will get pulled all over the place when in management but other than that its great.
good,management were good always looking to help there employees  I worked overnight so I've learned to unload a truck how to properly stock items and that you drop what you are doing to help a customer in need experience were all good no bad experiences at all
good,"Working at a pharmacy has its pros and cons. This is a very fast-paced environment that requires problem-solving skills when dealing with insurance companies. Working with patients that are annoyed with their high co-pay or patients that are feeling sick can be challenging. However, this is a very rewarding job."
good,"Great staff to work with, not for a lazy person. Store manager is great works hard and doesn’t ask you to anything she wouldn’t do.  It is a great positive place to work.  All staff work together."
good,"Great company to work for with flexible hours and great benefits. The corporate culture makes advancement difficult and is total bureaucracy, however."
good,Greatworking environment for this company but i’m Trying to work Two jobs to make ends meet l needed to make more money a hour could’t Pay rent and other bills so I was knee deep in debt
good,They just need more room for advancement.. Better benefits and paid time off for part time employees. Better management is needed. More perks for part time employees...
good,"Great manager and Co-workers"
good,"Always hiring which means large turnover. Everything is ok there. You need to watch sick days because they give you 80 hrs of a PTO, but if  you have to get an approval and you call in sick. It is held against you.  Only allowed to leave the phone an avg of 6miutes per week.  Or it is held against you.  If you take too long to notate after call it is also held against you"
good,"CVS company provides recognition to any deserving employees, offers excellent benefits, management are well trained and knowledgeable. My most enjoyable part of the job is I worked with great Team."
good,"I loved working at CVS. It taught me a lot of skills that I continually use, and working amongst adults as a teenager made a positive impact on my maturity and the way I am able to present myself in my day to day life. It was a great job that had thorough online training as well as on the floor."
good,"Great place to work, you can learn good and bad things about medications, how they work and useful tips from the pharmacist. Friendly environment. There fast and slow days."
good,The job consists of cashiering truck day putting all the merchandise away merchandising in all areas of the store. Managing the money for the safe daily
good,Each day at CVS is another opportunity to be challenged.The most enjoyable part of my job is successfully implementing and executing member letters on behalf of client.
good,"As an experienced retail pharmacist , when I applied with CVS Health, I knew  that the staffing guidelines and my expectations would often be different.  I did not expect to have a meal breaks and  knew I might work 12 or 13 hour shifts.  "
good,It was a good job that really taught me a lot about customers and management. I liked the flexibility it gave me. I'm a student and i'm in a band so I need a lot of off time.
good,i did three month as a extern  and i enjoy  learn new thing  about  working in pharmacy i    just wished i learn more  than production   and inventory
good,Had good experiences  there while I was working. Met good people just was there as a scho externship but was getting paid while doing so. One of my first jobs
good,I really enjoy my job with cvs. I have recently moved and need a job closer to home. The team really works well together. Managment is always there when you need them. Overall great place to work!
good,I was the head cashier and the customer service coordinator! my job was to ring and keep the front clean and help put away the truck! and take good care of customers!!!
good,"The pharmacist I worked for were very helpful, and concerned about me learning and applying what I learned to use as tools. it was a very fast paced environment but I learned a lot."
good,The only requirements was to show up on time you had 60 days to get your rate to 90% which is plenty of time to get fast at what your going to be doing no dress code besides no open toe shoes no tank top management is great they will work with you if you fall behind all around good company to work for
good,I liked the pharmacy itself but the corporate portion of the company interferes with everything. There's constantly changing promotions and policies to keep up with on top of the typical workload.
good,"Its all about how fast you can hustle on getting stock out while maintaining the strict requirements CVS places on customer service. If your not a aggressive go getter, best you don't apply to work here. No worries about a day dragging on, its so ace paced that before you even realize it your day has flown by and at times you cant believe how much you have done and other days you haven't even gotten through half of the workload"
good,"Everyday was a new challenge that I enjoyed... great Boss, great team to work with. I enjoyed planning events and meetings. The location for the office is convenient."
good,"Helped put me through college and was able to be flexible with any potential scheduling conflicts."
good,"CVS is a great company to work for.. Like any job,  you have your ups and downs. At my location we are like family.. We work together as a team ..Customers are great once you get to know them and they know you.. Some days are more demanding than others but with a team like mine, everything seema to always run great.. Just wish there were more advancement opportunities, other than that working there is fun."
good,"a typical day of work can be behind the register your whole shift, or on the floor stocking shelves. have to enjoy cleaning bathrooms. don't be fooled you will be taken advantage of."
good,"Arrive to work, see all familiar faces.  Review my workload, organize it according to efficiency. Be alert to TAT, and prioritize shortest as highest priority. Plausible I'll get the opportunity to learn how to key under a new carrier. This is exciting. Test your pace, test what is comfortable, make a judgment on how much will get done. Upon this finding, reach out to leadership if there is any pro-active results with which should be disclosed. Communicate, do not be shy, no shame in the truth."
good,Very fun environment to work in. Co workers were very friendly and made me feel at home. The idea of everybody wearing headsets to communicate throughout the store made work environment flow easily.
good,"Smart staff, managers and Supervisors. Your management really cares about you. It is a highly stressful position sure to the number of cases needed to close while needing outreach."
good,Cvs is a great company to work for but hours are not consistant and we cant get enough help. Mangers are helpful and nice. They have great job advancement but dont tea in well in the field you are in. There is no time to do training on new hires and work is not easy to do without loss of customer service
good,I worked there for my externship the process there was a little stressing but fair I personally enjoyed my time there got to learn on the field and see a good friendly relationship between the pharmacy techs and customers.
good,I have worked for this company for 8 years. i enjoy the people and the work ethics. Becoming a pharmacist has always being a passion and i am determined to be the best that there is out there.
good,"Working in a health care has been one of my greatest achievements, it has helped me to have the heart to understand different kinds of situations one may go through."
good,Good company to work for for the most part. Lots of work from home opportunity. Only bad thing is managers can take things personal (like using sick time or having a voice).
good,I have a substantial work experience in Data Modeling/Data Architecture. I have a track record of working in groups to achieve success. Typical day involved a mix of documenting project details. I learned how to streamline my work approach
good,I enjoyed working at cvs because it was a fast paced and versatile job. I enjoyed working with the other employees on my shift and it was fun. The job was easy .
good,"I enjoyed working for this company.Everyone is willing to help each other.Many opportunity to learn new skills ,away room to grow if you are willing to work for it."
good,"On your feet all day. Work hard moving around heavy objects, dealing with difficult customers. the work environment was good tho. I learned more about retail."
good,The work environment is fun and slow pace. I get to handle customers on a daily basis who come in multiple times a week. And the management are really nice and work with your life schedule.
good,"Excellent place to work.  The co-employees are wonderful and a pleasure to work with.  Nice environment to work in.  Not enough pay and hours, that needs to improve as Company keeps taking hours away from our location."
good,Fast-paced busy professional environment.  I enjoyed my co-workers and this job but was only a part-time position.  Sent to pharmacy technician training by company which was very extensive.
good,Training takes 6 weeks but while you are here you have a gym and workout area CVS believes that everyone can become a little more healthier and for mothers and mothers to be there is a quiet room that you can go and rest during your breaks CVS has so much to offer its a great place to work
good,"pharmacy tech fill medication"
good,"I enjoyed being able to help the clients in more than one way. Employees/Teams help each other when lacking in equipment information or behind on weekly quotas, Its a Team Effort in CVS."
good,"Having a system analyst background and being exposed to what was offered to me back then at CVS was like having a dream job. Great advancement, motivations all day long and management took very good care of the people"
good,"Good place to work- management was great. The hardest part were the unhappy customer with high co-pays."
good,I worked at CVS Health for a short time but wall I was there I hade a  great experience. It was my first job and I would recommend any one starting out to apply.
good,The company has won a lot of new business therefore a lot of opportunity to move areas. They also are acquiring many company which is adding to the growth.
good,"its a great place to work all employees and staff work great"
good,"I love working for CVS! "
good,"Work was pretty simple and in my eyes kinda fun and relaxing.  Doing things repeatedly and making sure everything was in the right placed and faced (looking nice) is very relaxing to me and that is what I had to do.  Working the cash register when needed made the day go by quick and was also easy to do.  "
good,"Normal Customer service workplace. Dealing with the pharmacy clients can be stressful, but the environment helps out with making customers happy. I like working for this company."
good,CVS was an interesting place to work because of the high turn over rate people were literally in and out within days. This proves for different personality encounters. This included the pharmacists as well as the technicians.
good,There wasn't a stable manager in the pharmacy department I've worked there 2 years and with in those 2 years we've had several different managers come in and out.. schedules weren't accurate.. employees were t held accountable for things that they needed to be held accountable for. Etc
good,"Very good learning environment for anyone just getting into the job or for people looking to further a career in healthcare. Management is very good, it is a quick paced position, however there is a lot to learn that will become very useful in many aspects of life even if healthcare is not a long-term area for you. Pleasant work place, and overall a great company to work for."
good,The work environment was great! Co workers were very supportive and patient.  Customers were a joy. Customer service is the number one requirement for this job.
good,"We try to encourage the team environment. As well, we recognize each customer that walks in the door. Assist customers with a verbal response if a customer only wants direction to a product or we will walk them to the product directly. We strive to build a great feeling of community with all our customers. I feel we do a great job as we have many customers that come in to see us multiple times a week. We have many disabled and mentally challenged customers as well as many elderly. Reading has a huge clientele of walkers so we also pride ourselves in making sure many are okay in poor weather. and little things, like double bagging items and multiple bags for even weighted carry on their way home."
good,I learned to face shelves and greet everyone as they walked through the door. The CEO of the company was very competitive and it was always about number one in their book.
good,Very busy and the day goes by fast. Fun place to work. Hard work worked up front and the pharmacy. I was always running around to help the customer to make sure they found everything ok. I enjoy being there to help all I can. I got all hours I needed. I now live in Texas and looking for hours and keeping busy.
good,"I was an intern at Omnicare for Pharmacy Technician. It was a great experience working with other pharmacy technicians, and being able to train and learn from them was was expected in a pharmacy warehouse. I put my education to use by helping them package and stock medication bottles. Making blister packs for nursing homes. Picking medications that needed to packaged and sent out. I liked working there because they were very helpful and taught a lot of different things."
good,i liked it but if you want to relocate sometimes its much harder then its worth. depending on which store you work at it can very stressful but if you love being a pharmacy tech then go for it
good,"Working at CVS is great, its not too challenging but there are certain things that must be done prior to truck days as well as store visits by district managers, etc. CVS allows you to learn how to work with customers especially when there is confusion about items and sales throughout the store."
good,Productive workplace and competitive enviroment. I learn every day diferent things. I like my schedule. My supervisor is the best. The hardest part of the job is when we are short of technician.
good,"A typical shift requires ones undivided attention and application of learned knowledge. Learned skills improve with practice and time management. "
good,"It is a great environment to grow. I enjoy working there because the company CVS HEALTH believes in diversity, and cares about the employees there with is always a plus."
good,"The day to day tasks are pretty repetitive, but enjoyable. Management tries their best in store, but does not always seemed to be recognized from above. We work well with one another, but there are days we feel a little more stressed out at each other. The hardest part of the job is working to satisfy the customer since there's always at least one customer that everything seems to go wrong for. I love working with the customers and being able to know that they are walking away with a smile!"
good,"Unfortunately, I had lost a great friend of mine and a week later my brother had gone into a coma, I did not intend to leave CVS but that was the case. A typical day at work was great because everyone had their own thing that they were always responsible for. when things are routine they become more efficient. Management had higher turnover than the part-timers but they all worked very hard to keep the store very productive. The hardest part of the job was coupon policies because they are ever-changing and will often lead to upset customers. The workplace culture was great at #5462 and that was the most enjoyable, having a closely knit staff."
good,I got along with my co-workers and supervisors .It was a very conducive working environment and everybody seemed very nice. Working at CVS Pharmacy/Health was a great learning process in my life as a whole.
good,I dont enjoy working at Cvs. Its all about favortism. Also there is no professionalism what so ever. We have no help for overnight. We have to do everything ourseleves.
good,A typical workday was stressful but the Pharmacy manager created balance. Management was understanding and appreciative. The culture was welcoming and I enjoyed my job to the fullest.
good,"Relaxed yet friendly and professional environment. Everyone is willing to help, colleagues are highly valued and treated with respect. Everyone is trusted and treated equally and treated like adults."
good,I enjoyed working with the customers making sure that they received  their products and that their wait in line was not long. The hardest part of the job was working with people who don't like to do their job.
good,Great company to work with and for. Company sincerely cares about their associates as well as their stores and their reputatuion. I enjoyed working here and enjoyed everything that comes along with it as well.
good,I have acquired various skills in such a short period of time. Very little time for personal life as for the hours we are schedule are not the greatest.
good,I had a nice experience working with the company. They exposed me to several things when it comes to retail pharmacy. I appreciate the experience and the customers while being there
good,"a typical day at work is having long lines with customers picking up medication arguing about there co pays etc, what i learned is that you cant please every customer, management was great, work place great my hardest part of the job was trying to help customer with insurance issues, the most i enjoyed was the customers especially our regulars coming in with there jokes, the holiday gifts from customers and the parties that they have for us. I indeed had a great time with CVS"
good,The company is great!! Stay away from penn center east building six location. Very high schoolish! The younger crowd can be a bit immature. If you are offered this location. Do not!! I mean do not take this location!!
good,CVS is a good company to work for. The benifits are great. The hours are good also. We have good lunches too.  The most enjoyable part of my job is on days when everything goes right.
good,cvs is a place where you determine how far you want to go.if you come to work with the mind set of completing task given to you by management then he/she will move you to the next phase with te company
good,"Its very busy, I like the pace because it keeps you busy and you get through the days much quicker. Store manager has the right ideas to have a successful store but also has a tough time keeping her staff happy, which in turn, makes it stressful and no fun to work there."
good,Cvs was a great company to work for. The pay wasn't that great and it didn't seem as though there was much advancement with the company. Other than that I loved working for the company.
good,"This is a great place to work, friendly environment, great pay and benefits the only downfall is they micromanage you. Other than that I would recommend CVS to anyone who qualifies ."

good,"I did my internship here while I was attending school to be a pharmacy technician (which is why I didn't rate the salary, job security and job culture) and I felt very comfortable there.I wanted to work there after my internship but because it was my first time applying for a job so my profile ended up getting locked. All of the employees were extremely nice to me and I didn't really have any negative experiences."

good,Enjoy working here. Everything to love. Simply need more money. I have no compliants about CVS. I don't plan on leaving just picking up additional employment.
good,Working in the IV department was beneficially to my career as a pharmacy tech. My director took the time to explain things I didn't know and teach me on the subjects.

good,You had your good days and bad days. Management was okay. The life of a call center. Either you are there or you arent. The pay and benefits were great. Training was good.

good,I think Omnicare is a great company and offer excellent opportunity for keeping up to date with the latest in technology.
good,Fast paced retail environment. Enjoy helping customers keep their health on the right track. Department could use more Pharm Tech's due to the high volume of scripts filled each day.
good,"A typical work day is in a nutshell, pretty eventful. You have a number of different customers with different ethnic backgrounds which gives you a number of different work experiences. "
good,"Opportunities from triage to final product checking and working with a team with the same goal."
good,"A typical day on the job would consist of me assisting the pharmacist with starting the morning workload. I would start the pharmacy software, check the fax machine for new prescriptions, open up the drive through, and start the morning reports.  I learned early on to pace myself when working in a fast paced retail setting to prevent becoming overwhelmed. I worked a long a great team, not only in the pharmacy, but also with the front store clerks. I enjoyed going out of my way to help customers both with inquiries with filling their prescription medications as well as help with searching for over-the-counter products. The most difficult part of the job was standing on my feet for long hours of the day."
good,"I am able to assist and make many patients who are going through tough life issues easier, all while dealing with their diseases everyday and make them as easy and normal as ordering clothes on line."
good,"It was a great place to work just very short staff, so the job was very stressful for employees and the customers. The company is a good place to work I would work for CVS again."
good,Very busy work place but makes the day go by faster. CVS health has very positive people that works for the company. We have regular customers that come in that makes our day fun and full of laughter.
good,CVS Health is a great place to start after college or polish skills as a veteran. They are an innovator in the health care arena and care for their patients and clients in every decision they make. Co-workers are friendly and great to work with on teams and expansive projects. Work-life balance is extremely good in the Caremark sector of the business and average in the CVS retail side.
good,"Working for CVS definitely had ups and downs, Dealing with management was great, dealing with co-workers and their personality was hard because it always seem to be negative and I like to think of myself always positive. As far as the patients that I would deal with was great, even if someone were having a bad day, a how are you? Or a smile goes a long way. the most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with most of management, a great team. What I learned working with this company, is that no matter how great you are to others, they may not be great to you, but that doesn't mean you loose respect for them or stoop to their level, and also learned parts of how to work at a pharmacy"
good,This provided a good place to gain experience and build my resume. Since i was a summer only position there was not much room for growth.
good,Very cool relax place to work. Environment was cool. People were nice.
good,"however the management for my store was lacking. Only issue i had was with upper management for the store. lacking proper communication. If you had to fill a RX, you could only do it at a CVS PHARMACY."

good,Co workers helpful. Busy with all reporting. Good place to work.
good,Enjoyed my Coworkers and interaction with Customers. Loved to learn from my Pharmacist.

I learned a lot while working in the pharmacy drug interactions, math skills, computer skills, compounding, prescrition language, insurance claims, etc. Management was great! I enjoyed working with my co-workers and management. Everyone was great and worked together as a team."
good,"Typical day would involve interacting with patients over the telephone or in person. Filling and typing in prescriptions and trying to solve insurance issues. I enjoyed working with my co-workers since I have been there for so long and we all manage to work together as a team and if anybody needed help there was always someone to turn to. The hardest part about my job is not being able to satisfy every patient when something does not work out and we need to find another alternative, but in the end we find the best possible resolution for the patient."
good,"A typical day at work I rung up customers merchandise, accepted payments, and gave change when due. I also did returns and exchanges when needed. I learned how to do lottery. Management was really nice. My co-workers were great people to work with. The hardest part of the job was organizing the stock room. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing price tags and helping customers."
good,I love working as a front store associate because it give me opportunity to interact more with customres. Ive gotten to know some customers on a one on one  and have established great relationships

good,I loved my job.  I liked the fact that i had 4 10 hour days.  I sat in a cubicle and listened to my music or audio books.  The only reason I left was pay wasn't enough for traveled distance
good,"Day-to-day tasks were very straightforward and direct, and the procedures were easy to access and reference. The most difficult part of the job was getting information from other departments, especially in cases of customer prescription transfers and fulfillment."
good,They train really well there. Sometimes you have to deal with crazy ppl but its not too bad
good,Nice place to work but very micromanaged if you aren't use to that.  You sit constantly and not ergonominc.  7 out of 8 hrs you do not move.  Fast pace which makes the day go by.  Staff are great.
good,"Sometimes micromanaged certain employees. I worked at the "
good,"Very Interesting company, a great place to be! I would go back if the position was avaiable."
good,"Aetna great company to work for, high call volume, learn about the pharmacy department very interesting calls something different on  every call.  Learn alot about the Medicare plans.  Management was great, awesome co-workers.  Enjoyed helping members understand their plans and assisting them to get their medications."
good,I was only there to fulfill my hours for my diploma. It was still a pretty relaxed environment.
good,"A typical day at work would be helping out all customers with questions , concerns and complaints . Making sure the store is neatly put together , shelves are stocked and front is neat . The management honestly was a big concern for me , good people just bad management . My coworkers are very out-going and enjoyment to be around , always so helpful and considerate . There is no hardest part of this job everything is self explainitory and easy . The most enjoyable part of this job is Truck Delivery ,"
good,"Love the branch manager.  She is the most wonderful, caring person you will ever meet.  She is the kind that can scold you and by the end of the conversation you are telling her thank you.  The staff is wonderful.  The hours are long and you are required to do admissions after hours.  Commonly you will take on your patient load and then some.  There were occasions that you don't get home until 9 or 10 at night.  You put around 1500 - 2000 miles on your car a month.  A lot of driving, but at least you are getting paid for it and it is a good mileage reimbursement.  The benefits are good with a choice of bcbs or kaiser. They are all over the country and you have many possibilities.  There is a lot of freedom with this job and the nursing aspect is light."
good,Providing customers with help in servicing their needs. Assisting in speedy checkout as well as maintaining the maintenance of the store.
good,Very energetic place to work and always something to do.  Co-Workers are great and helpful. They do what they can to help if you do fall behind some. The hardest part about this job is if anyone has any problems with the insurance company. The most enjoyable part about this job was to help people get what they needed at that time and the most of what they could get.
good,"i started as cashier and sales was dept mg over cosmetics.a day cvs was stocking shelves and doing markdown and .advance to lead sales person basic sames casher expect you had more duties ,order product ,opening and closing which include money and banking .i was ask if interested training as pharmacy tech was trained my duties were filling rx and calling doctors office,cashier for pharmacy customer,order for pharmacy."
good,"My day started with breaks at all the registers,then taking of my orders and restocking shelves. Good customer service is a must."
good,I appreciate interning at CVS/Caremark as a Tape Librarian because I learned so much about the professional environment and I’m thankful for every person in my department for feeding me the knowledge needed to succeed.I would like to thank my Managers for giving me the chance to work side by side with the IS Operations team.
good,"I greeted customers, ran register,assisted customers, conducted price changes, inventory, stocked shelves, cleaned store."
good,I worked for CVS for many years. I only left for a change. I had been with company since I was in high school.
good,While working with CVS I learned how to communicate better with the general public of various life styles and economic stature. I also learned about product placement and planograms. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and made friends with some of them. The hardest part of the job was only being able to enter the store 5 minutes prior to opening. I would have rather had 15 to 20 min to process all the morning setup work that was needed in the front end and photo lab. This would have allowed for better customer service as I would have been quicker to respond to the customer instead of being tied up in testing procedures for film.
good,"A typical day at payless would be very busy helping customers, putting away shoes and ringing out people on the register. I learned how to count down the draws, deposits. The management was great because they let me cross train in everything. No hard part about payless I actually really liked it there. The must enjoyable part about this job was the people (co workers and customers), I am a very outgoing person so I like to talk,have fun with the customers and help them with anything they needed."
good,A typical day at CVS is pretty relaxing. My hours vary but I usually work for 5 or 6 hours. Management is very respectful but they also get their work done. There is nothing hard about this job. The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting new people everyday and learning how to communicate better.
good,"A typical day at work would begin with inventory management. Prescriptions that were not picked up would be returned to the shelves and we'd adjust the inventory. We received a daily shipment of drugs that needed to be checked in and stored. When customers came, I correctly calculated dosages, entered prescriptions, dispensed medications, prepared prescription labels and filled prescriptions for approval by pharmacists. I excelled at customer service and resolving problems with insurance claims or other issues. I learned how to multitask and was proficient with daily tasks. The management has given me an idea of how to run a pharmacy, and often trusted me to help in their duties. My co-workers were like a family to me. We all were so close. We helped each other out and worked as hard as we could to ensure the work load was evenly dispersed and would help if someone needed it. The hardest part of the job was usually some discrepancy with the insurance company or a miscommunication with a doctors office. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help sick people feel better. Our regulars were like a family to us. There is no greater feeling than knowing you are helping someone feel better, saving them money by working with their insurance, and seeing the appreciation in their eyes when you go the extra mile to help them."
good,I have great coworkers. Management is great to work for and work life isn't to hard.
good,"this was one of those jobs where the saying, if u love your job you'll never work a day in your life type of jobs."
good,There are no typical days at my store just lots of insurance issues and customers without compassion.
good,Learned a great deal of info about PBM. Typical day is 8 hour day with a good work life balance.
good,"Its not a bad place to work for but once you've reached the ""pay cap"", you will stay at that rate forever regardless of minimum wage and/or even made to retire. Definitely not a company for it's employees."
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company and with the people I worked with. And helping the customers was very enjoyable. We were always busy. I learned alot of new things such as processing film orders, upc codes and operation of the company."
good,I have good co-workers we work together as a team. I have a great manager
good,"I worked on Thayer Street in Providence Rhode Island, the job was great met a lot of people you have the same regular customers usually if you work the same shift which I had the 7am to about 4 or 5 pm and it was the same guy that came and brought four packs of cigrattes then you have the same customers that buy newspapers, you get to know them by name what they buy, my co workers were great we had no problems what so ever. Overall it was a great job and if offered to go back I would no problem."
good,Cvs coworkers were so warm and friendly and really team players and fun to work with
good,"A work day in CVS is short. The 8 hours go by slow because your in a small place, as well as waiting for customers.My managers were great. We had a lot of freedom. I really liked the 30 min breaks with two 15 min breaks."
good,"Helping out in Health fares, I learned how to interact with patients, management was very organized, and co-workers were very helpful, my experience with Cvs Pharmacy's was good as an employee"
good,"CVS is the abbreviation for ""Consumer Valued Store""! A typical day at CVS/pharmacy consists of great customer service, healthcare needs, and convenient wants."
good,This is a good company to start with. There is not much money to be made but you get what you put in.
good,"It was a quiet place, great atomsphere, very diverse. They always gave back to the employees,"
good,fun clean work environment easy training the best part was being able to work with the public and the hours were great
good,Went to work in photo lab was a very busy store open 24 hrs i did alot of stock developing of customers film and attended to customers and their needs.
good,"very busy store, I learned from the older workers, we worked as a team, we took short breaks when we were not busy, i enjoyed helping the customers."
good,"Over the years, hours have been cut drastically for all employees. It essentially became a part time only position and cut many employees from service altogether. Prepare for 4-6 hours a day, for only 4 days a week or less. (even when you request full time) Other than that, it was wonderful."
good,"I have enjoyed my work with CVS. It is constantly changing and there is always something to learn. The schedule allows me flexible hours which was very important as my children were growing up."
good,Cvs is a real good place to work  dry friendly make the customers feel like they are home it’s a very good working environment to be in it helps u grow as well
good,"-Clear direction on company strategies "
good,"I love working at CVS but the pay isn't that great and sometimes it gets stressful. The customers are great, I have a couple that I always talk too. CVS feels like another family to me"
good,"Sometimes we don't have enough staffs to accomplish the task or not enough hours to do the job required."
good,A lot of the Job involves learning day by day. Growth within the company solely depends upon personal investment. There is a lot of room to grow within the company. There are no limitations on your possibilities. Above all else if you are work driven and consistent this job is very secure.
good,"Working at CVS as a pharmacist is stressful and difficult. Need to multi-task, be able to take verbal abuse from patients, work quickly, efficiently, and accurately. Meet company numbers and do it all with a smile."
good,Working at CVS is really great the only downfall is just not a guaranteed 40 hour week. it has its slow days and fast days working on the holidays is in great saying because you get holiday pay which is always a bonus the customer is there have their days but the employees make the day is good and so does the work
good,Ive done several manufacturing and warehouse positions and i found one where only i am accountable for my own effort and work ethic. My personnal success isnt hindered due to another. Company is very willing to work with you
good,"If it wasn’t for the company cutting hours, I promise I would still be at the location. It was a friendly environment and the management was awesome. The pay was good as well."
good,"A typical day at work includes learning new things, meeting new people, and building relationships with the co-workers and customers. This job is rewarding and has been beneficial over the years."
good,"Management was fairly good and there was always a solid schedule."
good,"I enjoyed working at CVS Pharmacy because this is the type of work I like personally. However , Many of my friends didn't like it at all since there's a lot of expectations from each individual. very stressful environment at most times and you must work a sense of urgency. The expectations from the management team are unrealistic and unattainable with the amount of hours you are giving to run your store. CVS Pharmacy knows that those expectations are unrealistic and unattainable with the amount of hours they give their managers to run their stores. You are almost forced to work off the clock to make it happen . I worked at 2 different stores, before I managed my own store and I even helped in other stores for visits and what not, and I've witnessed it all from management and supervisors and ALL their Pharmacy managers working OFF the clock to get their work done and catch  up on whats needs to be done , we as managers know this is the reality of working for CVS. So if you work off the clock you will be terminated and if you don't complete your tasks you will me demoted or terminated as well. so your only choice is to work off the clock secretively to make sure you have a job."
good,CVS Health is a great establishment with a lot of great people. They offered decent hours with good pay. They're more than willing to train you completely from scratch. Overall CVS Health is a good company!
good,"Great work place , friendly and very flexible with hours, I mainly worked the cashiers but I did  some photo stuff I managed certain departments when needed to , and learned to close the store down ."
good,It was my first job after high school and I cant complain about it. It was a great job to earn work experience as I was able to know how the work environment is and how to be responsible for my own tasks.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at CVS. I worked with a great team.will definitely miss working with and for such a great company. Highly recommend CVS!!
good,Working at CVS has given me medication knowledge and customer interaction experience. I have learned a lot and gained knowledge in many different areas while working here. I would encourage anybody in the medical field to understand the pharmacy side of medication administration.
good,"Stocking shelves, Returning merchandise to shelve, keeping floors clean, and assisting customers in anything that is needed. I meet a lot of nice customers. I enjoyed my job"
good,Looking for something more challenging. I have a lot of valuable experience with CVS Health though. Extensive cashier experience. Leading during a shift.
good,Company was great but I was injured on the job and never received any restitution from employer so when structural changes happened in my DM being rerouted to a different district the new DM was not a very good employee of the company and And ended up getting fired for being intoxicated on the job
good,"It was overall a great work place. They was always plenty to do to keep the day flowing by. The tasks were never terribly difficult and if they were you were offered plenty of help. However, the over management was less than welcoming. They seems too busy to acknowledge any issues or seemed to care about employees. Always treated you like a number not an employee."
good,CVS Pharmacy took over Pine Pharmacy and kept me as an employee. CVS is mission focused on improved health for their customer base. they stress that staff be extremely customer service driven.
good,"When I worked for CVS Health, I really enjoyed the diverse environment. Made a lot of wonderful friends and coworker. Some supervisors were more friendly then others. Overall I was extremely excited to be a part of the company while helping others."
good,"I have enjoyed working for CVS in Liberty Mo. Store manager is amazing, team is hard working (most of them) and the work is easy if you just do it. Many opportunities to advance, benefit options, fair amount of vacation, fair wages and overall great company to work for."

good,"over all good job , nice coworkers positive work environment definitely good place to level up gives amazing opportunities to workers and also if very flexible"
good,"It was the best experience I could ever hope for, best co-workers I could ask for, my favorite store in the city and the best customers a store can have."
good,It's a pretty comfortable job you go in you already know what to do its very easy to get used to once you are there and has very good benefits plus it was very close to my house
good,Hours range from ok to good. Flexible to a certain point. Some opportunities to advance/career build. Coworkers are pretty nice. Managment is good. But overall a pretty good job.
good,It is very diverse but operate as a team.  Everyone seem to get along and make it worth coming to work each time. The communication is great when it comes to switching shifts or needing coverage.
good,Work environment was independent. Had resources to help with decision making. Hours were not most ideal for family if you plan to pick up kids from school. Colleagues and management were very supportive.
good,"Health merchandise expert and handler (product recommendations, shelf stocking, inventory checking). Providing excellent customer service. great manager"
good,CVS Has many opportunities to cross train in other areas of the store as I was cross trained as a pharmacy tech assistant. It was a fast paced work environment.
good,"CVS is a very dynamic company to work for because they want you to continue to grow and learn within the company and build a career and life for yourself, but they can be very demanding at times."
good,"They try their best to make it fun, great management but things constantly change. They give you plenty of time if you need to be off with your family if it is serious."
good,"while not rocket science, it definetely can be a challenging job. You always need to think and you are always learning because insurance and laws change."
good,Handled and processed cash and credit card transactions along with some store returns.Management was awesome I loved the customers the hardest part of the job was learning the isle and items.One of the best jobs I've ever had.
good,"Very good company, nice learning environment. Staff is very helpful. Flexibility of schedule. Very busy and fast working environment. Management is very helpful."
good,"You have to be able to take in alot at once as far as training goes. Cross training between front store and pharmacy. Modules, lp quiz, boh, cycle counts, coutmer service, restocking and many many more things to do."
good,Employee benefits are very good. Work life balance.Work from home facility. Management is very good.There are many technologies  to learn and environment of workplace always joyful.
good,"CVS Pharmacy was a great first start into employment. I learned how to handle money, provide excellent customer service, and oversee. My first store was very fast paced due to store closing (Cloverleaf Mall). I then went on to Forest Hill and Colonial Heights where both led great work experiences."
good,"Great wok place, friendly staff. Everyone was so warm and welcoming. Customers were amazing. Love interacting and getting to know different people. Prepares you for board certification"
good,I loved working here. I would like to join CVS again. Although I've had issues re-entering this field of work I still enjoy meeting people and helping them health wise.
good,"Fun place to work especially the team I have. colleagues of various background and culture, great opportunity to learn about other people around the world. And I being a Vegan matches with the company vision of helping people live healthy."
good,"Great company, I was able to advance quickly, however compensation is among the lowest in the industry. Often too many lines of business that have completely different rules and dress codes although they are merely a few feet apart in units."
good,"Known mostly for their Retail stores and pharmacies, CVS is a very large company with many other divisions that most people aren't aware of.  Working in the retail setting can be a miserable job with little reward (so I've heard), but many of CVS's other businesses can be great to work for. "
good,very challenging and demanding good people on the leading edge of technology and management philosophy - customer focused and market reactive short project cycles
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job at CVS is that I get to interact with so many people that come into the store. For example the typical day at work is seeing beautiful people coming in, full of energy, happy and smiling. The part that gets me the most is when the customers acknowledge you as soon as you greet them with a, ""hey, how you doing today."" That makes me feel like I contributed to their good day."
good,You would have a schedule that you had to follow and that we had to have the customer service and great works. We had friendly customers most of the time. You had great workers from the Pharmacy to the staff int he front of the store.  The friendships and how we had each others backs
good,Very busy environment. customer service skills needed and patients can be very nagging about their prescriptions. Must please everyone everything is about metrics
good,I love CVS pharmacy it’s a fast pace environment which suits me perfectly because I can keep up. However if you can’t handle the stress I do not recommend it because it can reach a breaking point for some.
good,Great place to work interesting people you speak with on the phone and they will melt your heart. But it's hard to hear the older people tell you they have to choose between rent and medication
good,I do not have any complaints. The company is great! I work at a fast paced store and the time goes by pretty fast every shift. The staff members are truly team members. We work together to get the job done successfully and to meet our expected goals.
good,"Cvs was a great place to work at, I drove a forklift truck picking items from shelves and building pallets out of them. It was a fun, independent job. If I could go back I would!"
good,"I was really pleased at my job as a customer service rep. I left because of the salary. Use to love my job, manager and co workers. Safe place and great experience."
good,"Cvs is a good company to work for, Most of the pharmacists try to be fair. Pay is decent, hours are good. CVS offers the opportunity to learn and grow."
good,"EXTREMELY BUSY FAST PACED ENVIRONMENT."
good,Learned the responsibilities of the technician which were an extension of the short 6-month curriculum of classes to get certified.  Could have used more practice in classes.  Most enjoyable part of job was production or filling of prescriptions. Becoming familiar with medications.
good,"CVS always shoots for culture within its stores. I've been at several stores and its very different how each store has its' culture. We strive for what's best for a guest and also our colleagues, and it carries well if the store has a good culture to start off. However you can always have that store where everyone seems to want to go home 24/7, not wanting to work, and leaves more task for others.

good,"I enjoyed the variety of challenges and learning opportunities.

From time to time I would work registers but for the most part, I was only needed for voids and overrides. I would hold a shift meeting discussing how the day had been, what we needed to do and giving encouragement to each co-worker. Everyone worked together cohesively. Joined together on big projects, but was also able to finish small projects separately. Nightly, I would pull registers and lock up. The hardest part about working at CVS is trying to find space. Large shipments for holidays and sales would come in and all of the inventory would have to be moved around to accommodate all of the items. The most enjoyable part was working with the public. There were many regular customers that I became acquainted with on a first name bases"

The pay for a 16-year old was amazing, yet, most never advanced. Their pay would increase, but expectations were higher at the same position. The company would just throw around seniority, but that did not ""truly"" offer security."
good,"First you run the front cash register ringing up prescriptions and filing prescriptions, then you work the drive thru and do the same, then you are in production filling scripts, answering phones, and input insurance, then you type prescriptions input insurance and answer phones.

The most enjoyable part of the job was customer service which I excel at.  I always like pleasing the customer and go above and beyond to do so.  The most challenging part of the job was the pay.

good,"This job is a great job for anyone looking to obtain a stepping stone  in getting into a health career field. When you go into work, you'll have to answer phone calls regarding members experiencing various situations regarding their prescriptions, plan design, copay structure, etc. The job also makes sure that the phone calls are handled at the highest quality to ensure great customer service. There are also 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch in between shifts.Not only that but there are also small events that the job holds including birthday parties for co-workers. Management is top notch at CVS Health. The supervisors are always there to help out their employees and they never make the work environment seem ""boring"". They teach us creative ways to handle phone calls and their presentations are always keeping our attention. Not only that, but management tries their very best to keep things motivated in order to reward employees for their hard work and dedication. The co-workers are very friendly towards one another and it won't be hard to find great friends there as well. They're the main ones who keeps the energy going in our job and they also help out each other in certain situations if our supervisor isn't present at the moment. The hardest part of the job is accommodating towards the shift change that the job assigns to the co-workers. Sometimes I feel that because the job changes shifts for everyone, it ruins the routine that every co-worker has created in order to accomplish the tasks that's needed outside of work, including myself. But this situation is pretty rare"

The management team was great. They help everyone get the job done and made sure everything got done correctly and efficient. The co-workers were great it felt like a family because the amount of team we spent with each other, The hardest part of the job was when we were short staff and certain people could do only certain things because how they were trained and the rest was up to me to complete. The most enjoyable part was knowing that i helped someone out on getting their medication to them and knowing they will be okay."
good,"I really like working for CVS Minute Clinic.  The only downfall is the long shifts and having to work every other weekend.  I have a family with 2 children, ages 12 and 1.

They are very caring, they acknowledge that you have a life outside of work and try their best to accommodate. I worked here for 7 months before receiving a promotion to key holder, so the advancement is very quick if you do your job right. Its not a heavy workload, its just your customer base that can make the job difficult. Of course youre working with a lot of elder/sick people who are easily agitated, and can have the worst attitude but aside from them, everything else is great."

After I count the safe, I consult with the other manager on duty. We go through the to do list together, making sure we have our direction for the day. I proceed to getting the list done, while helping customers on the sales floor, and answering cashier pages. I've learned that customer service is what makes a company grow. A growing company makes happy associates. I have a great store manager who is very knowledgeable. His lists are direct and clear to follow. My co-workers need a lot of coaching.

good,"I open the Pharmacy along side the Pharmacist.  First we take care any customers who want to pick up medications or have any questions.  I proceed to process prescriptions through our insurance verification and count them out.  There are normally anywhere from sixty to one hundred prescription that have came in overnight into our computer.  We call these maintenance or scheduled medications for our regular customers. We retrieve phone calls from the system.  I also take inventory count of all medications that are under what we call C III to C V medications. A new order of daily medications come in from Cardinal Health around twelve o' clock.  Another team member normally comes around this time as well.  This is our rush hour time.  We are normally filling prescriptions that didn't get filled the day before due to us not having them and also many customers start to come in from clinics and physicians offices, and for lunch break.  Co-workers get along great!  We do a lot of collaborating and team projects but also independent as well. Hardest part is making sure we have satisfied the customer. Insurances more and more are taking certain medications off of there formulary list which can be quite frustrating for our customers. Most customers come in because they are not well we want them to feel good about the customer service and get the medications out in a timely manner.  Most enjoyable about my job is making the customer happy.  Knowing that they can depend on our pharmacy for having there medicine in stock and done in a reasonable amount of time is great satisfaction.  We"

good,"I started off as an agent answering phones and with in a month I got promoted to a SME (subject matter expert). I was in charge of 500 agents. I would walk around 4 different buildings and make sure that the agents are answering the right questions for the members as well as take escalated calls if one gets out of hand and the agent is unable to help the member. shortly after I was promoted to and aux runner, in charge of all the SMEs, making sure they are taking proper test and answering the right questions to avoid giving out members the wrong information. "

good,"Mondays and Tuesdays are normally our slowest days unless its a holiday. I have my regular customers that comes in the mornings to purchase newspaper, these things make my day seem brighter. Around 1pm- 2pm the store starts to get busy. There are days that I do Hallmark, checking in invoice, organizing cards and gift bags. I have learn the ways and policy of the company more, the customers that shop at CVS their likes and dislikes; type of services they like. I have also learn how to do planograms for the store, that is new designs for the store. As for management my store manager, we work with him and he works with us he will go the extra mile for his employees. He has plans that he would like to accomplish for the week and for the store itself. There is not a hard part of my job because if a problem comes along coworkers or manager will come together and help out. The most enjoyable part of my job is customers telling me ""Thanks for all your help"" to me is a sense of satisfaction."
good,"I wasn't necessarily working there, it was more of an externship. I learned how it was to work in a medical workplace. I got along with everyone and was hoping to get hired but they weren't hiring at the time."
good,There is a great amount of flexibility in this job position so if you're in college or working a full time job in the day this is a manageable job to have.
good,"A day at CVS Pharmacy is continually ongoing. You're constantly moving and there is never a time when there's nothing to do. I enjoy working with the customer and providing the best customer service. Iam also the Inventory Specialist at my job. I can always expect to come in with different duties. I really enjoy it. The store I work at is an old store and the pharmacy is very small. There are two other techs and and of course the Pharamacist. Its very mushy and pushy but everyone get along very well. The Pharmcist is very cool. In some stores the Pharmacist are very uptight and too serious but I honestly thinks its good to have a good day with laughter and still get the workload done. The only thing is keeping up with your modules and CE's that has to be done. Its kind of hard trying to work with them and being busy at work which exhausts you sometimes. Overall, I enjoy working in the Pharmacy but there are a lot of other things that has to be done in between counting,data entry and checking out guest. There will be days when you can only fill pescriptions and not do any daily task. There is a lot to do with not so much of a good pay and few hours."
good,"Answer incoming calls and Trouble shoot insurance and pharmaceutical problems"

Having great communication skills is a must when working efficiently with doctors and insurance companies on every level, from keeping the customer happy to assisting that their prescriptions are accurate, contributing to their safety, health, and well being. I enjoy helping people on a day to day basis. :)"
good,"I ran the register, did data entry, answered mutiple phone lines, filled prescriptions, trained new technicians, and much more. I learned to be patient and listen to people, help people with there problems, and to multitask. My coworkers were all nice at times but things got stressfull at times. the hardest part of the job was dealing with all the different attitudes from coworkers and customers. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting acknowlege for doing a good job, having satified the customers, and the customers tell you thank you."
good,I loved my job with CVS it's a very fast paced place which is ideal for me as I'm one of those people who needs to be working at a constant pace. During a typical day you are constantly moving filling scripts or restocking medications assisting customers it's always go go go and i loved that.
good,A typical day at work is the usual. assisting the wonderful customers.

good,"I stored, counted, and dispensed prescription medication as orders needed filling. I learned how to be an effective member of a team and also how to lead when necessary. My co-workers as well as the management team were a joy to work with and made me want to come to work. The hardest part of my job was that I worked at an extremely high volume store, so it could get extremely busy and at times when we were short handed. The most enjoyable part was the smile on my customers faces when they walked in and saw us behind the counter, and their satisfaction with our service once they were leaving."
good,"A typical day at work is full of both challenges and the day to day routine.  CVS provided me with the opportunity to work with the public and meet a lot of new people.  The daily challenges allowed me to learn about the company, the industry, and myself, which resulted in personal and professional growth.  CVS provides a healthy work environment and an open door policy.  While it is hard to say anything is particular is difficult, there is constant change and with change, difficulties tend to arise. The biggest change and most common in the last few years has involved the constant change in regulatory laws regarding healthcare and the changes surrounding the Affordable Care Act.  The most enjoyable part of my job at CVS has been the ability to work with some of the most amazing individuals on a daily basis, and the opportunity to meet many new people and build friendships with the customer base."

good,"A typical day at work includes taking, filling and selling prescriptions to patients, with occasional instances of making outreach calls to patients and inventory management.  While working at the pharmacy I have learned to master the art of multitasking and time management.  On top of those aspects, I have learned all of the brand/generic names of medications and have learned the basic components of them.  Management is very flexible with hours and works around my schedule well.  My co-workers all enjoy when I work because I am very good at what I do and I bring a humorous and happy attitude to the job every day.  The hardest part of my job is giving bad news to patients, whether it is because of insurance issues or costs of drugs or that we do not have something in stock that they may desperately need.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that I get to develop numerous relationships with the community that I live in and get to know each and every one of them on a personal level."
good,Being around people on a day to day basics makes me feel good.I keep a smile on my face its rare that im upset are even show im upset.I get alone with everyone im around.the hardest part about a job is working with people who dont want to work.the most enjoyable part of working is being in a good work place
good,"I would deliver prescription drugs to customers homes, assisted living homes, and skilled nursing facilities.  My co-workers were aways helpful and friendly.  The only problem I really had was the take over of the department by a corporate company.  Our department had been bought from Owens Healthcare by Omnicare.  The feeling of concern from the company went from a person interest to a more distant and more cold atmosphere."

good,"While working at CVS, I was able to learn a lot in the healthcare field. I worked in a fast paced environment and was always able to get the job done. I was able to work with my fellow employees as a team in which made a big difference in the work flow. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was when I left the company due to the fact of getting to know the day to day customers and building relationships and getting to know them quite well. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be that I really did enjoy the feeling of being able to help the customers when they were in need. It could be to help them find an item in the store, answering questions about their medication or heath problems. Just to know that I may have made a difference, really felt good. "
good,I really enjoy working in the fast-paced environment.  There are really nice customers and of course the rare angry customer.  I've learned a lot about different medicines and how insurance companies work.

The hardest part of my job was learning the generic and name brand names for the drugs we dispensed., The most enjoyable part of this job was the continuing education that I was required to do in order to keep my national certification up to date."

good,"A typical day at work was never the same. The constant variable was transitioning from the different stations, but each day brought new challenges and lessons. I had learned a lot about going above and beyond for the customers in order to get their medications to them in a timely manner. The management was very helpful and willing to work with me to perfect any areas of weakness. The most enjoyable part of the job was to get a patient that had been struggling to obtain their medication, obtain it at an affordable cost."

I learned that if you organize your time and learn how to multi-task. That you would do good on taking care of your patients. I really liked the managers they were there  to guide you and support you. The managers also helped coach you if they saw you needed help in something that you needed improvement on. The hardest part of the job was to keep on track of your patients orders and organizing your call list. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing you co-workers and getting fed often if we had worked over time

The CVS Pharmacy that I worked at was very busy all day, so it forced me to learn quickly and grow professionally as a pharmacy intern to handle many difficult issues, sometimes all at once.

I have never worked anywhere that appreciated their customers and employees as much as CVS.
good,Working at CVS really allowed me to gain experience and to meet many financial goals in my life. Although i had to work over 40 hours a week to meet those goals the hours i needed were always available.
good,"It’s a job involving drugs that keep people alive, so don’t apply if you aren’t going to take it 100% serious. It’s a great work environment but you have to buckle down and remember you have people’s lives at stake every fill."

good,Enjoyed my opportunity to manage and train associates and teams for personal and career development. It helped me to prepare my own self-development to advance and establish my future career path.
good,"CVS Health is a great company that continues to find ways to help improve its patients outcomes. This is done through patient care calls in which patients are follow to see how they are managing a new medication or to ask any further questions that they may have. Another way they go beyond most tradition pharmacies is by having adherence calls in which patients on chronic medications are reminded monthly to come pick up their medications because they try to make sure a patient never skips or misses a dose. Even if a patient does not have a prescription in the pharmacy, any customer can always go to the consultation counter to ask the pharmacist about any medication or vaccine questions they may have."
good,Was a good fit. Staff was great. Management was satisfactory. Benefits were great.  Place and location of  the position was a good commute. Training was  good.

I have had the opportunity to cross-train from the front store as a cashier to learn the pharmacy and train to obtain my Pharmacy Tech licence and have held my licence for 5years!  :)"
good,I enjoyed my time at cvs. At times we would be understaffed but we still got the job done. Everyday was a new day. Stressful at some points but nothing is ever easy.
good,"When employed by CVS years ago it was a great paying job-long hours and average stress"
good,"CVS Pharmacy provides a great collaboration between healthcare and sales.  While on the job you have the opportunity to learn about medications, health insurance, etc. You also are a great help to the clients because not many know how pharmacies work and the benefits they provide."
good,I enjoyed my time at CVS. I had an great manager. A few employees were not great to work with/for but it was manageable. They claim you get raises automatically as time passes but I never received a single one during three years.
good,"A great work environment. However, due to staff cuts, it is stressful at times.  The manager is a great guy. However, my pay seems inadequate due to work I am asked to perform"
good,"Typical work day. Everyone works as a team. If I am not sure what to do, my supervisor will show me or someone that does know how to do it, will show me."

good,"I really did enjoy my job at CVS and I would return if offered, it is a little stressful because of the red tape within the company but if you can morally move past that you will be fine."
good,"I honestly enjoyed working as a pharmacy technician at CVS. The pay was minimal but I also had no prior experience, no training and no schooling for the role so it was understandable. My biggest complaint is that they didn't allow overtime at all. At the time I worked there we were always short handed and needed the extra help yet I was almost literally being kicked out as I hit 40hrs for the week. Knowing how much work needed done this caused me to rush my work and we were limited on time to do any training or fulfill our duties for the day."
good,"Working in the pharmacy at CVS Health consisted of entering patient information, insurance information, etc. You also have to count, and distribute pills into their vials, and place them where the pharmacist can approve them. Then proceed to check the customer out at the register."

good,"I enjoyed work within the CVS Distribution Center. The co-workers are friendly and helpful. If you enjoy working over time, the night crew shift is for you."
good,"Have loved working here since the beginning of my employment."
good,"nice place to work 8 hrs a day with the opportunity to do overtime in the mornings as well as after 5pm sometimes the job does require you to work mandatory overtime but only 4 times a week "
good,"Great company to work for. The stores are always fast paced, there is always something to do. The company work culture is excellent. Great benefits as well."
good,"Ok place to work if you like customer service, high stress job environment.  People are friendly but work is hard and fast paced with daily deadlines which are nearly impossible to meet."
good,"Worked out of  my home office and car, set up own meetings and open houses to promote company,liked working independently this way. The hardest part was being the liaison between corporate and local offices, as there was internal conflict which created a stressful experience among colleagues. Typical day was early morning account visits, training personnel on our software, assisting staff using our system and showing a presence in the community.  The customer service and problem solving was enjoyable.  Would have a group conference call every Friday with direct report to give valuable feedback to corporate."
good,"Great job, just wish it paid more. Work with your schedule if you're a student. Employees are welcoming and easy to get a long with. Great skill to learn/ on resume."
good,"I enjoyed working at CVS Health, I chose to leave for more money but would be willing to go back. I loved my manager and the operations manager as well as the director. The culture could use a little uplifting and flexible lunch breaks, but overall I liked working here."

good,"I enjoyed so much working for CVS. Learned so much. Learned how to treat customers in a friendly manner. Learned about Labels, the photo department, Hallmark Station, Make-up station. I was a shift supervisor for the morning shift, sometimes night, overnights, and overtime. Had a great time working there!"
good,Great place. Great people. Very busy. Customers are normally regulars. They make learning fun and easy. Very organized and well maintained. Learning to read the name of medications can be confusing...
good,"Very busy store, stay busy all the time. Always something to do, helping customers or cleaning. Good place to work, good people. Hard to be in one place and watch for your customers. Loved to work with good workers that didn't mind working"
good,Nice place to work. Learned alot from co workers and others around me. Alot was learned about the different types of medications on the market and what works best for each person.
good,Coworkers at Omnicare are encouraged to get together for holiday functions as well and a Thank You Card system had been implemented to encourage positive feedback among peers.
good,Good way to get your foot in the door for the pharmaceutical industry. I have been working there for over a year and I still love everyone that I work with. Although it is fast paced it can be enjoyable at times.
good,"Management was understanding as long as I performed all my duties as required. Once you get into a routine at work, its nice to know what to expect everyday and potentially even start work ahead of time if its not too busy. Hardest part was dealing with insurance related issues. Most enjoyable part was the people I worked with. If the work environment is fun, it makes the job easier."
good,"CVS holds to their aim ""guiding people on a path to better health"". They prioritize patients and customer service. A position in the pharmacy relies heavily on teamwork and quick problem-solving. A typical day is packed to bursting with things to do and people to deal with. I've gained confidence in my ability to resolve conflict and leave customers satisfied. The hardest part of the job is the workload. The best part is getting to know your patients and the community you serve."
good,Great management and awesome team I worked with in Tucson AZ was very friendly and learned so much in very little time.  I now have moved and am not making the same hours as before unless I'm traveling from store to store.

good,"Work place were you can improve and learn new things to better your position in the company, Workers get the opportunity to express themselves and be themselves."
good,"Fun environment. Work was fast pace however the staff I worked with was good and very knowledgeable. The challenging part was supporting so many people physically in the location. Approximately 1,000 end users physically. Approximately 2,000 users remote\externally. They made it a fun place to work. There were not too many career advancement opportunities in the location I was at..however if you were willing to relocate to other parts of the country there were several higher level positions available."
good,"The people here worked together and were always respectful and kind to one another.  The job was very detailed, but fun because of the environment and people."
good,Loved the pharmacy environment. Pay wasn't great and neither were the benefits. Definitely not enough employees for the script capacity.................
good,"The company offers good benefits but technicians top out at too low of a pay for the work they are doing. In my opinion, certified technicians should be making more then $12-13 an hour."
good,"We stock shelves, greet and acknowledge customers, operate cash registers, change prices, clean stuff. Overall, it's just like any other retail store."
good,Great place to work.  They provide a clean workspace clean environment they don't allow any smoking around their facilities their managers are very helpful an understanding and everybody works as a team

good,Great place to work. Understanding friendly staff. One of the best teams of people I worked with in my 15 plus years of being a Technician. Would highly recommend this place for any one.
good,"CVS/Caremark is a mail order pharmacy facility. A high volume of mail is received daily. The goal is to process all mail requests on the same day it is received. The facility that I was employed at was closed. I would not be able to recommend my local friends apply. However, I would recommend that my friends in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area apply to that facility. "
good,"Loved working for Omnicare. They didn't appreciate US workers, so they outsourced us to India for $$$. "
good,I loved working at CVS I just had to move and couldn't transfer which was a bad thing I miss working at CVS the management was all friendly and everyone had a close bond

good,"I recommend this job for college students. "
good,I really love working here. Everyone is so nice and willing to help you learn. Most cases the customers are great. I love my regulars! We usually order food out and have it delivered or someone runs to get it. Our pharmacists are great and so nice and fun to be around.

good,I have a great manager who always gives her best and never lose a chance to teach me about the different part of the job as how to be courteous and helpful to customers.
good,"As a technician the typical day includes a number of things. These task are never predictable, each day is a new day with new challenges. Some of these challenges included using critical thinking to work around insurance complications and communicating with customers along with using great customer service with extreme precaution to protect patient personal information."
good,"If I could get back into the CVS warehouse I would in a heartbeat, it was a great place to work, no it wasn't perfect but the pay was great. If you can last past the 90 day orientation your pretty much home free so long as you don't do anything reckless, stupid, or illegal"
good,"Being able to interact with all different types of cultures that walked through the CVS Pharmacy located on The Las Vegas Strip near The Monte Carlo. Always having a beautiful day of organized work ethic that, that particular CVS Pharmacy had to offer its employees."
good,"Daily filling prescription, and answering phone call, patient refill, drop off, and pick up can be stressful if you are short staff. Over all very good company."
good,i enjoy the CVS that i work at. i have been here my whole 5 years. my manager is simply the best. He is very fair and tries is hardest to accommodate everyone.
good,"I opened and closed the store, did payroll, counted tills, helped in the pharmacy counting pills and printing out paperwork, I was an asst. manager so I was the main one to aid in customer service, I printed out film etc."
good,"Working at CVS is a lot of fun and all my coworkers are great and hard working. It is extremely busy everyday, but it makes the time pass by quickly. I love being able to help people on their path to better health, it's extremely rewarding. The hardest part of this job however, is being yelled at by customers. You just have to let it roll off you, because you knew you worked extremely hard."
good,"I liked working there because when you were busy and needed help on the phone the supervisors, Mangers and even the CEO would get on the phone to help. That is one company where you feel the upper management knows what you are going through cause they experience it too."
good,"The workplace culture at the CVS Health store that I worked at for a short amount of time was exciting and very welcoming, especially as a new employee. I enjoyed going into work everyday and very rarely looked at the clock counting down how much time I had left until I had to go home. I really enjoyed interacting with the customers as well as the pharmacists too!"
good,"For my first ''job'' very friendly, amazing interaction with customers, coworkers are very helpful towards each other. This place truly helped me improve my communication skills as well as the skills to multi-task."
good,"After signing in the phone and computer, I would bring up me email to see if I had a priority list from my lead.  I would then call or enter who or what was needed (watching for time zones).  After that I was mostly on inbound calls, pulling up records, seeing what the problem was and getting the information needed, and if necessary, transfer the call the another department."
good,I enjoyed working for CVS because they were very patient with me and they were with me many times they were very nice and I enjoyed working with all of my coworkers

good,"A typical work day at CVS/Pharmacy is very busy. At my store, we fill on average of 500 prescriptions per day. The job title includes counting medications, customer service, answering phones, typing scripts, and billing insurance. There is never a ""slow"" day at CVS. It is always a fast-paced environment."
good,"Typical day would be get to work and give the best customer service I can give."
good,"Close door pharmacies have an unique sort of people, usually. Their beards can be any length they way, their hair can be styled however they please, and they can have tattoos just out in the open. I personally haven't seen anything particularly crazy, but having a beard myself, I think it's nice the dress code is so lax on them. The commute is a little far for me, but I make it every day in at 10 o'clock and get home by 7:30 most days. As for the jobs, I have done almost everything on the floor. If it involves a phone and a patient I have probably done it. It's got a decent amount of variety in it, and keeps you from getting too bored staying in one spot for too long."
good,A typical day at work is busy.  The most enjoyable part is working on your own and as a team. I am a Customer service rep. but they are relocating out of the city once they merged with another company.

good,It was fast paced and I loved the responsibilities that were put on me. I liked the fact that they promoted from within the store.
good,"Quiet work space that allows the ability to focus and get my work done with minimal interruptions. "
good,"Was a great learning experience,learned almost every thing I know from this job,however getting to Human Resources was not very easy and made it hard to complain about anything"
good,Great place to work.  Wish territories were smaller.  They give you freedom to run your territory how you feel fit.  Would recommend to a friend.  Pay raise was low
good,"i did like cvs good support "
good,"I loved working for CVS. They had great practices in place, the dedication and care given to our customers was honest and earnest, and my pharmacist and other coworkers were supportive caring and hardworking."
good,"Healthy Work environment, Fair Policies.Support for Policy based decisions. Excellent Hardware, mediocre software. Excellent oversight structure."

good,"Good support services"
good,"typically starting off the day by jumping right on the computer to type up scripts that have been sent in. Counting and dispensing meds. also jumping on the register whenever lines where long and the ""pick up"" area needed extra help. Also trying to help customers whenever i was able to alleviate some pressures from the pharmacist on duty. The hardest par of the job was the volume of the store i work in a very busy store which means you have to make sure your prioritizing correctly by helping customers and filling scripts, even though i enjoy when work is busy because i like to keep busy. the most enjoyable part for me is when i feel like i made a difference in someones day and they go out of there way to thank me and are appreciative of the time and effort i deal with a lot of sick or elderly customers and i enjoy feeling like i made their day just a little bit easier."
good,"Good place to work with a lot of promotional opportunities. Overall great support group when it comes to employee appreciation. They are always ready to assist, subject matter experts are awesome."
good,I interned here for a work experience program to help build my resume. Management was very helpful and nice. I learned how to efficiently organized retail sale product display and assisted with customer fulfillment to ensure satisfaction.
good,"CVS is not a good company to work for, they are unethical and under pay their employees. Recognition was not part of CVS work rules neither was trying to help their associates."

Filling, reviewing and verifying prescriptions while trying to meet a daily deadline .Working for CVS taught me the importants of prioritizing your work day. When first starting my new position it was a struggle but with the help of my wonderful manager and co-workers I became once of the strongest worker on our team and received many awards. The hardest part of my job was learning how to work with insurance. The most enjoyable part of my job was catching on to working with the insurance."
good,"Cvs pharmacy is a great place to work. I have been employed at CVS for 10 year and I have seen many people such as managers, techs, PIC's, and even DM's come and go. I've also notice that each year CVS comes up with new ideas to help improve the quality of care for our customers. Our pharmacy team member build relationships with the customers to make them feel welcome and care for by our pharmacy. As the lead technician at my store I love trying my new staff and helping them solve problems without having to bother the pharmacist. I also take pride in helping my customers with in of there problems and assisting them with anything that need that's not pharmacy related. The hardest part about my job trying to get some of my rebellious employees to take initiative."
good,"This is a job for people who want to work in this field. flexible hours, and management is willing to work with your schedule. Great medical knowledge."
good,"Assisting customers at drive thru,drop off,and front end, or on the phone, filing scripts while working. Production area where you print three labels at a time and look for the drug. I learn something new everyday. Management team is very awesome always there to help you. The hardest part of my job is having to make a customer wait especially when we are very busy. Enjoyable part of my job knowing all of my customers name by heart and getting to know there families and going above and beyond to help my customers any way I possible can."
good,"helpful system, make the work look easy. training for 2 weeks, gave us a very good foundation to do the job. short time to work for them."

good,"Learned a lot about medicare coverage, and people must understand the plan that they are enrolling in, medications coverage, and about every phase that a member will go through, often times people fall in the GAP phase and freak out on how medications are no longer pocket friendly or covered under plan. Being able to try and help an elderly person can be tough but I prided myself with patience and customer service skills and always being polite with P's and Q's even though it sounds very cliche I treated them as if they were my mom, dad, grandmother, grandfather, and etc."
good,"customers are hardest part of job but overall not bad experience, management works with you and good benefits easy  to get promoted"
good,A typical day in the pharmacy includes a very fast paced environment.  Between taking care of your patients to trying to get scripts entered in the computer.  I learned how to use time management wisely and still take care of my customers to make sure they were satisfied.  My co-workers were amazing help and we all worked great as a team.  The hardest part about working in a pharmacy was trying to make sure every patient was satisfied whether it be taking care of insurance to getting their medication in.  I loved talking with my patients and doing everything I could just to make sure they got what they needed.

good,"Good to work at CVS."
good,"My job duties included work under the direct supervision of a licensed pharmacist and perform many wide-range pharmacy-related functions. I was routinely tasked to help prepare prescribed medication, such as counting tablets and labeling bottles. Other tasks were associated with entering data from a hard-copy prescription into a computer system, and processing insurance claims through a third party billing. I also performed administrative duties, such as answering phone calls, restocking shelves, operating cash registers, and fulfilling “drive-through” orders.I love challenges. Serve every customer to fully satisfy their needs and expectations!"
good,"Really enjoy being an NP at MC. The store manager and pharmacy staff are awesome, and the flexibility of my schedule allows me to enjoy lots of time away from work. Has been the best healthcare position I have had thus far."
good,Work varies due to issues that develop. Checklists are provided to insure shift work is completed. Department is ISO certified which means there are work instructions to be followed to insure quality results. Managers are fair and engaged. Management is dedicated to achieving defined results. Co-workers are easy to get along with. Multitasking can be the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is making a difference by getting issues resolved.
good,"A day at work would start out getting things ready and running like the computers. I learned how to talk to customers and how to treat them. Management was awesome, if i needed help on anything they would come over right away. My co-workers were also great, we all got along. The hardest part was trying to math real quick in my head. The most enjoyable part was seeing the smiles on my customers faces. Loved making them happy in any way possible."
good,"A typical day involves filling prescriptions that are set to be filled for customers. This involves making calls to customers about any issues, checking out customers at the register, and maintaining a good working environment that is organized and clean."
good,"I worked for the company a total of three years.  The store is located up the street from a court house.  So, we had the same customers every day at the same time each day.  They were all friendly customer.  Likewise the associates were just as friendly.  They made going to work each day easy.  It wasn't a stressful environment and not to demanding.  I mostly did register and I organized the sales floor."
good,I loved working at the pharmacy. I became the inventory specialist so I made sure all medications and supplies were accounted for and organized at all times. I learned how to use their database for everything from entering patient and insurance information to entering and filling prescriptions.
good,"I really enjoyed working for CVS. The hours that I worked did leave a lot to be desired. I did however meet lots of new people.  These people I will never forget.  Have recently considered returning to CVS.  Not completely decided about that yet.  It was challenging which i enjoyed.  I have a lot of good memories with CVS.  Some good, and of course some bad.  Comes with the territory I guess.  My co-workers were more like family.  Hence we often categorized our relationships as work families.  From time to time I see former patients that I served at CVS and it makes me feel really good to see them all doing so well."
good,"During my time there, i would transfer medication, from one company location the next. Other days i would help transfer patient files from written files, to electronic medical records. Co-workes were very pleasant, were always in a mind state to work together as a team. Management was always helpful at answering questions, and very insightful on knowledge regarding the Health Care industry."
good,I would work with customers all day. It was an exceptional job. I kept the cashier area clean and sanitized. I checked out all guest. I rotated product. I built displays. The hardest part of the job really was building up speed to get certain tasks done faster. What made that so hard was the lack of opportunity to step outside of my job tasks.
good,"A typical day would go like this. I would come in whenever I was scheduled to go in. I would make sure the previous cashier was ready to be released and helped them if they needed help with finishing up. I had a daily checklist to go through that ranged from cleaning to stocking shelves. I would greet every customer that came through the door and asked if they needed help finding anything. "
good,"each day at work was amazing. learned how to fill and refill prescriptions, management was cool"
good,I greaw from a teenager to young adult there. I was taught responsibilty and the importance of being on time and about having customer service skills which is important everywhere you go. I enjoy this job very much because it was the first job that start me with alot of the skills I still have today.
good,Working for this company was tough. the most obscure part was having to deny patients for certain drugs and programs. i would never want to deny any one from assistance. But this job will help you develop empathy if you do not have it and courage.

good,"I started with doing refunds to customer, and vendors,"
good,"I worked as a n inbound call operator and handled everything from medication reorders to complaints.  This job could be very high stress, but the management was always doing something for us to help keep us sane.  We had quarterly BBQs, monthly pot lucks, team building meetings, contests, raffles, and very emphatic supervisors."
good,CVS has a great understanding for customer satisfaction and care. I worked every position available in the pharmacy to extend my knowledge of the work flow and process. The customers often requested me when they were there to pick up a script and I was the only employee offered tips on several occasions. The joy from connecting with customers is indescribable. The most rewarding opportunity I had ever been given the chance to take on.
good,"I enjoyed working for cvs carecark for 2.5 Years. I had wonderful supervisors. I loved talking to the members, they were a pleasure to speak with."
good,"I'm very content with my current job here at the Indianapolis Distribution Center. "
good,Typical day at work was coming in at 10:00pm and start counting the cash registers money. Tell the clerk(s) what their job for that night would be. I learned how to supervise a whole store by myself and how to make sure customers are happy when they leave. Co-Workers were very friendly and nice. Hardest part of the job was to make sure everything was in perfect order before the night was over. Most enjoyable part is when customers would come ask for assistance.
good,"great place to work, always kept me busy, always learning new program, able to speak to management, management available for questions"
good,"While externing at both OmniCare and CVS I learned the value of Multi-tasking. I enjoyed the fast pace environment at CVS and the ability to self manage at OmniCare."

good,"working cashier register , working with the public and assisting customers with any issues"
good,"Every work day is different. Each morning I set out with an agenda and often have to be very creative and flexible to complete my goals. Half of my day or more is spent marketing to hospitals and home health agencies. When a hospital has a referral, I do a bedside teach with the patient on either IV infusion or enteral feedings, coordinate the home health needs, follow up with case manager and follow up with the patient once they are discharged."
good,"At Coram Healthcare I get to work with a variety of patients that require tube feeding supplies for nutrition. Since I have been employed I have been able to gain some experience in the healthcare community and experience the billing and insurance aspect of it all. The hardest part of the job would have to be my commute to work, but I very much enjoy being able to service our patients by getting them their nutrition and supplies in a timely manor so they can better manager their lives."

good,"Although the hours may be long at times, it is a very positive work environment!"
good,"Drug regimen review and prescription verification with a big emphasis on patient counseling"
good,"A typical day of work at CVS consist mostly of a high volume of incoming and outgoing prescriptions. The work flow there is pretty smooth based on the professional training of each technician. everyone gets along very well and we're all like family. I have learned the value of helping people and showing that you care. Being courteous and doing your best to help the customer goes a long way. My co-workers and I work as a team and always lend a helping hand to one another. Although the work flow runs smoothly, the hardest part would have to be the insurance issues that you run in to on a daily basis. It's the part where you have to explain the issues to the customers that is hard. They have no idea what your talking about so you just have to explain it as clearly as possible. The part I enjoy most is knowing that at the end of each work day, I've helped someone."
good,"I loved working at CVS, my boss was nice. He bought us lunch and dinner most of the time. He gave those who wanted more hours, more hours, and we worked well as a team.  we always covered each other without complaint. I miss it."

good,while working at CVS you learn a lot with working in customer service
good,"Great company , feels like we are family hddsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssx"
good,"As a pharmacy technician, it could get demanding in the afternoons around the time people would get off work. So you had to be quick and really learn how their computer system worked. The training was difficult, but I enjoyed it. Once you accomplished learning their computer programs, it was much easier. The knowledge I learned about filling prescriptions, the drugs themselves, various insurance and it's application were priceless and something I haven't forgotten. Everyone I worked with, management included, was wonderful to work with. The only thing I didn't care for were the odd hours I worked and the pay wasn't nearly what I had expected. The hardest part was filling prescriptions for people who had little to no patience, especially when there was a lot of customers waiting. The most enjoyable were my co-workers."
good,Omnicare's department are teams that are well-oiled. We work well together. Each team is vital to the running of the facility and there isn't one team more important than the other.
good,"I enjoyed the laid back atmosphere and some of the life long friends that I made while working at CVS CAREMARK. While working in the Control Room I received training that has helped me in my medical billing career, as well as pharmacy. I enjoyed everyday as an employee with Caremark and I'm grateful for the knowledge and  opportunities extended to me during my time of employment."
good,"Truly enjoyed working here, I only left because we moved out of state temporarily. I wish I could get back, the work is hectic and busy, the pay could be better, but overall the pharmacy team in my location was a great bunch and the demands that I needed to meet for my family were always met thanks to great co-workers who were willing to help others out."

good,"stocked candy room"
good,"like CVS, schedule good, not enough support staff, felt powerless as a manager at times, maybe a corporate issue. loved flexibility and software, good supervisors"
good,CVS is a great company to get started with. They train you to death (online modules)which is a good thing. If you can get a tech or pharmacist to train you correctly you will be extremely successful.
good,"slow-fast paste job working."
good,They are a very good team to work with. Everyone that i worked with helped me when i had a question and it was a fun environment. My child got very ill and was hospitalized and i had to quit. It was very upsetting but i had to be with my child.
good,I learned how to run a pharmacy smoothly and met some great people.
good,"Managing patient's profiles with their medications, insurance(s), treatments, and many more. Having to input new admissions into facilities and current patient's update information and medications in a timely accurate manner. Handling paperwork, customer service, and communicating with the facilities on daily basis. Co-workers are awesome, amazing, friendly, and always willing to give a hand. This a high productive place and busy constantly."
good,This company helped us to learn lot but was failure only because of poor management.
good,Loved going to work whenever I was scheduled to work. Just the environment alone was great to work in. When you needed help it was there and available for you.
good,"Excellant work place to work for 15yrs there .Co worker were great"
good,Stocking items was my day but everyone cant stock it looks easy eventhough somtimes others can make your job more complicated than it has to be.Some co-workers just need to stay on the register for me I dont like to stand still have to be moving the whole shift my manager  thought something was wrong with me but he enjoyed that I was a hard worker who ndidnt take a lunch break or break in between.I enjoyed working alone its more peaceful.
good,"This is currently my internship for school. I do not earn pay but I must say I love the pharmacy team everyone is kind and do not mind helping you learn more information, and I have benefited a great deal by interning here"
good,"It is very time  strickt as any call center should be , management is very friendly and has an open door policy but of course there is always the black sheep in the family  co workers very friendly and supportive "
good,Working at CVS was great! Fun place and great customer service
good,"CVS is family to me. My managers and Pharmacist are the best managers I could imagine. They are nice, very helpful and supportive of what we do. They also trust their employees well and very caring. Working in a retail is tough but the managers make it easy by helping us and not getting annoyed if we ask too many questions, infact they actually teach you. The most enjoyable part of the job is when your customers come back and look for you to help them, they recognize and gives you thank you letter or thank you gifts for taking care of their medications. It's  very heart warming. "
good,"It was a fun, very laid-back place to work. This was probably the best administrative assistant job I ever had."
good,Enjoyed interacting and helping the customers and solving problems. Very fast pace. Coworkers were a plus; always working as a team which made it a fun environment but were extremely professional.

good,"The great experience of my life. A great working team and a very good management. Well the hardest part of my job was unloading the trucks, but even there i had a lot fun.

good,"Great job but it consist a lot of heavy loading, I learned a lot from the job ."

good,"This was a great job for a young person. We had great managers, flexible scheduling and worked throughout the store. No one was just a cashier, you had variety."
good,"Great diverse team of all ages, bright and intelligent. Management is excellent, great exposure to all departments."
good,"One of the best places ive ever worked at, hours were fair and scheduled as needed, the staff and management were also very friendly and glad to help, and the work though sometimes hard was fun and made time pass quickly which is the most you can ask for."
good,"I feel this job would be great for either a short term employment or long term. I feel that the pay could be a little better considering how well known the name is, however, managment was always nice and willing to chat and was crossed trained with any aspect I showed interest in."
good,The staff that I work with are great. They are motivated and are very productive. Makes it easy to go to work to work with such hard workers and fun personalities.
good,deliver to all cvs stores good co workers management was good some stores were tight to get into nice equipment should of stayed and put my time in regret leaving
good,My typical day at work was long and stressful.
good,"Call center environment, must meet department goals, sales to be met by clients"
good,great place to work every morning coming to work couldnt wait to start my day management was great co workers fun but professional at same time only con was my hours i didnt get that mean so its was hard to pay bills and go to school
good,"Well a typical day at work would be come in and start counting all the prescriptions pharmacist entered from the night before and try to get everything caught up while at the same time deal with the customers as they come in to drop off, pick up or even come through the drive thru. organize all the bags that are checked by the pharmacist and organize in its order by letter of last name, after we have been caught up with work we find other things to do like checked all the expired medication through out the pharmacy, also refill the labels, and pharmacy bottles if we are out of stock, and clean everything when our shift is over. I have learned several things by working at cvs pharmacy one of the most important is always treat the customers as if they were family, keep them happy and smiling. My co workers are like my best friends always willing to help and keep things in order as scheduled, making sure we are always busy no matter what. The hardest part of working at cvs pharmacy was when they switched the computer system and it took pharmacist and technicians a while to adjust, so it became a lot more difficult to enter prescriptions because of the different codes and the pharmacy became busier and it was a little hard to do all the tasks trying to learn a new sytem besides all the extra training we had. and books we took home to study, and the best part of the day is when i see my customers satisfied and they leave cvs pharmacy with a smile and i could go home saying. ""I did my best today and my customers are happy customers""."
good,A fast growing company becoming the industry leader in PBM.
good,Basically helping customers and making sure all daily tasks are done in a precise time.The hardest part of my job is the help not being there.The most enjoyable part of my job is helping others i enjoy helping others.
good,I would typically fill pills
good,"A typical day at work, would be running the cashier and photo lab. Training to be a Shift supervisor, handling money for the other coworkers. Completing all beauty displays and completing all photo orders. My co-workers would ask me for help or any problems they had. I would teach the co-workers new things that needed to be learn, and trained them in the photo lab. I didnt believe there was a hard part of my job, i loved my job and working hard. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers with anything they needed. I enjoyed working everyday, i would be the person all the workers would call if they needed someone to come in. I worked for other Cvs stores if they needed help,"
good,It was nice experience to work in omnicare inc. All ways it was good.
good,CVS Pharmacy is great place to work. The pharmacy is a busy place but the staff works together as a team to provide excellent customer service. A typical day includes counting and filling prescriptions. Calling insurance companies and MD's for clarification on prescriptions.
good,excellent company to work for . Training is very good in retail and this company actually fixes the problems of running a store. the computers work the vendors are good one of the best retailers around to work for.
good,I was only for the summertime I really enjoy it wish i can go back.
good,"Typical day at work involves inputing and filling prescriptions, handling insurance issues, helping customers. I learned a lot from their excellent training program, it is easy to learn. Management are great to work for and with. Coworkers are great as well. Most enjoyable part is the coworkers and pharmacy managers."
good,"I was hired as a pharmacey technicinan,but I had to operate the register in the front of the store,I had never worked for a department at CVS and had to float to another department! I learned alot working up front. the management was real nice. The most fun was getting to know the customers and other personnel."

good,"Going into work here is like being at home. It was fun working with their team. It fast-paced, quick, and fun! The team made me feel like I was at home and we always had laughs everyday. No matter what, I came and left with a smile"
good,This job is helping beneficiaries with their Medicare part D plan. I'd answer the phone and answer basic questions of Medicare but with this company I focused on their silverscript medicare pdp plan. Leading customers to the correct department or even disenrolling or enrolling them into the plan. The management was a delight and showed me alot of respect because of the knowledge I do have in this subject. The co-workers as well were a delight and I truely enjoyed them. The hardest part of theis job was...I didn't have a hard part for this job. I think the best part was being able to share my knowledge and seeing the other side of the coin sort of speak.
good,I love going to work at CVS . I've learned alot in the time of employment. My managers are good dedicated people. My co-workers sometimes give me a hard time but at the same time are great people. The hardest part of the job is dealing with all the insurance policies. The most enjoyable thing about my job is having one on one contact with the customers.
good,I worked there for almost 2 years and made some close friends and got lots of experience.
good,I love the job that I do. It gets stressful at times but at the end of the day you can look back and see that small child that was not feeling good and know that you contributed to her getting better by providing her medicine. I have been blessed to work with great people with in this company!
good,i love working at cvs but it really made me mad by firing me when i was in the hosp for a week and had and atill have a paper from my dr saying i can go back to
good,"I loved it, because I love helping customers. Stocking, working the cash register, learning more things i had no knowledge of. Great environment to be in"
good,"I enjoy working for this for the pass 33 years.   My employment history with this company varies, I have worked in the customer service department, Individual billing and enrollment department and I now work in the Medicare case installation department."
good,"Overall, CVS is a good work environment. I am cross trained as a supervisor and pharmacy technician. Depending on where I am working front store or pharmacy defines my tasks. Daily, I work with customers in all aspects of retail, I supervise the workings of the store. I handle the cash, hold keys to the building and am responsible to ensure a safe and positive environment for customers and employees. As a technician, I work in the pharmacy at pick up, production,drop off  and drive through. I aid in filling prescriptions, and inventory tasks. I interact with my peers, pharmacists and patients in a professional and caring manner. I work well under pressure, can multitask and stay focused in all situations."
good,"For me, I like truck days.  They kept me busy and my mind occupied.  Time flew by.  I also really liked the people I worked with.  The atmosphere at work was always comfortable and happy."
good,"It is a good company which offers a lot of benefits ,friendly environment ,challenging but fun ,one of the biggest pharmacy chains in USA, a very good place to work in."
good,I have worked for this company twice and I enjoy it just wish for my qualifications and being I am also pharmacy tech licensed I was paid more. I have two kids and it’s rough sometimes.
good,"Cvs is a challenging and fun environment. It always pushes me to my limit which I love. I have learned a ton from this company, they have a great leadership program."
good,CVS has been a great place to work for with great staff support. I worked mostly at night which was pretty quite. Easy to job if you like people and give great customer service.
good,CVS is a stay on your toes job. You do a lot of things at a time so you stay busy but it's productive. You'll come across some people who may try to play out the system however it's a simple situation. Manager's help throughout the day but you'll feel undoubtedly essential to the company.
good,Not commensurate to job requirements and duties. Incurred job injuries and work compensation on two occasions. Good for tuition reimbursement for employees interested in education
good,"Not bad at all, if you need steady income. The 2nd shift supervisors are helpful. 1st shift feels more strict. Overall the company is a good place to work if you like to not be bothered much, and like to think a lot since you mostly work alone. Certain positions you are required to make a percentage which comes from the amount of work you do in the time you were supposed to. Example; you are a stocker and has to fill your cart with boxes and cut and put them away in 30 minutes and you did it in 28 minutes instead. Your performance would be around 106 because you saved 2 minutes on the trip. I think performance is the more annoying of the jobs but it’s alright."
good,I love working there. They really take there time training you. Nice environment.Great schedule. You have your own desk. Pay could be a little better but really nice place to work.
good,"I was able to learn a lot from the techs and the pharmacist every day I went into the pharmacy. It was a new experiences and I loved doing the job, it was easy and the staff were so friendly with us, the interns."
good,"great manager"
good,CVS introduced me into the work life. It showed me what to expect in a work place. How to conduct myself and move around. I am actually very pleased with my experience there.
good,My manager as well as coworkers made my job more enjoyable. Tallapoosa location is in a small town so I quickly had my “regular” customers that came in that I enjoyed seeing daily/weekly. It’s a busy job but very relaxed. Everyday you had a set goals on jobs to do each day so everyday you came into work you had work to do and didn’t just stand at the front waiting for guest to check-out.
good,A slow-paced job. Lots of new things to learn. A great place for a first job. Management is great and everyone is so nice and helpful. A great learning experience involving patience.
good,"It's hectic and fast paced environment. People are more focus and driven on work and not other people.  Workplace culture is okay, very inclusive and work ethic is great."
good,"Typical day at work was good, management always ready to help you to train.but you need to be fast learner. Once you know what you are doing the job will be easy."
good,highly competitive environment to work in. very stressful . but i rather a busy store than a slow store. benefit package somewhat okay. less tech hours meaning the pharmacist will have to do alot. always demanding more
good,Some are run better than others and set to higher standards while some locations remind me of Dollar General. They are moving toward overall health hubs and getting away from grocery. I like that they support healthier living and smoking cessation. They also have Minute Clinics in some locations which are like Med Express or Urgent Care
good,"I enjoy my job inside of Target. First, Target is one of my favorite stores to shop in, so being able to work there is a plus. I love to engage with people and be helpful in any way possible, even if I am showing a guest where something is inside of the store. I love to be helpful with guest saving money, and with them leaving satisfied with my customer service."
good,sMIT program sucks. They can only have 2 per district. No other option to advance at CVS one you become a shift supervisor. People that work at the CVS are for welcoming
good,Good place to work but hours hard to keep not set up hours and lack of security.  Managment should be more understanding of family come be ffg ore work.
good,"Management staff is very knowledgeable, respectful, and accommodating to varies employees availability. Employees get recognized for varies reasons. Cvs offers generous about paid time off."
good,Job retention is high which is good when one has a position but it is difficult to secure promotion. I rather enjoy the work environment and my peers which is why I feel conflicted on seeking employment elsewhere.
good,"Working at cvs has helped me become a better person, it helped me with my social skills and the hours were flexible. For example, say you were working on a Friday night and you were supposed to hang out with your friends, you still can when you get off because they only close at 10 depending on which one your working at. Some are 24 hrs. All in all working at cvs was GREAT!"
good,"CVS Health & all its affiliates are an absolute joy to work for due to the emphasis on individual care of patients as well as an array of options to help whoever may need it not only in the pharmacy, but in all retail stores."
good,A great company to work for. Challenging with multitasking and customer service skills. The hardest part of this job was when insurance would not cover medications needed for a customer. The easiest was assisting customers with my knowledge and their needs. I learned patience and how to please unhappy customer. Very busy and fast-paced atmosphere!

good,I greatly enjoyed my time at CVS Health. It was truly a learning experience. My managers and team members were very helpful and friendly throughout my whole experience.
good,"Cvs is a great place to work. I worked there for 3 & a half years! There is always room to move up within the company. I started off as a cashier then moved my way up to a shift supervisor, then I got cross trained for the pharmacy. Which not only allowed for raises which was a plus but it also allowed for me to learn new things but allowed for me to meet new people and work in a different environment. The pharmacy that I worked at is a very very fast past pharmacy, doing way over 500 a day. It was tough but I learned fast. Everyone there was a family"
