rating,review
bad,"tech company with 67 stores worldwide. The store has a store manager, and 4 ASMs. There is also a gaming expert and a community expert. The store has 45 employees"
bad,Liar Liar pants on fire. Gave the best work to other people and leave you starving for credit. Don't work for it even if they pay you a million dollars
bad,"Regret joing the company, a waste of time"
bad,Stressful with lots and lots of bureaucracy and politics at every level. Quality of work is not so good in India. Mostly restricted to the UI development.
bad,very closed to themselves unethical workforce. they ask you to do illegal work for example Lie to the customer. I advise not to work at Microsoft. Unethical management.
bad,"was having to do premium support with zero training, everyone there doing support, including long term people would have to google everything to get an answer, I am not sure where the brains of Microsoft are, but they are not in Irving Texas, management was zero help, impossible to become full time, after you 18month contract, you are let go and they would bring in a new group of people to train in how to google support for Microsoft."
bad,"Like most places in the former-USA, regardless of whether one is liberal or conservative or of their ethnicity -you do not matter, your cooperation, work ethic, accountability all have no value.  In the North West, they have just as much hick / redneck  or  liberal SJW pride as the next fool with US citizenship.  At Microsoft if you show your teeth when you smile they say that is a sign of weakness.  The USA is full of superficial morons that have no idea how to improve anything, just like Microsoft."
bad,"Microsoft has a very clear divide between Full time and Contract employees. The reason for this is that the full time employees have free range at the contract employees. We are verbally abused, forced to work well over 60 hours per week with no OT pay, no consistent communication exists and last minute demands are turned into high priority so that they are delivered right away with 0 prep time. The full time employee I used to take direction from would submit report requests at 11:00 p.m. at night and would expect them in his inbox within 2 hours or by 8 a.m. the following morning. None of this of course communicated ahead of time. I had hoped to pursue a full time career but after the abuse I experienced I would never apply to Microsoft again."
bad,Zero work-life balance. If you like numbers that's the place to be because once you get there you become one. Most of the time you are locked in a room.
bad,"Very difficult company to integrate from the outside. No formal training or onboarding provided.  Commoditized selling approach, front line is completely disconnected from CEO or executive leader mission of solution selling."
bad,"Quite Frankly, Store 0006 management has their heads up their butts. its all about the customer screw what the employee tells them. Microsoft retail sucks."
bad,Microsoft is a great place to work. They value work/life balance.  Very team based environment.  Everyone is treated with dignity and respect.  Great cafeteria.
bad,"I have never been treated so poorly at a job, horrible experience being a contractor at Microsoft. Management is horrible, and FTE's (full time employees) are valued more than contractors. A demeaning job that pays well."
bad,"fakesters.. the jobs advertised are not reals."
bad,This company has gotten too big and cannot manage to recruit properly as well as poor management which is awful. They act like they are giving the world such a great product when they really have not changed much since windows 95 lol.
bad,"A typical day will always be a surprise. That was fun at first but after a while, you get tired of the inconsistency. I have learned a lot about Microsoft. Its a great company however, if you are working at this location , Arlington, VA you are going to be miserable. The management is definitely unqualified. They babysit instead of manage. The culture is really relaxed, and that's the problem you can really doing anything you want and sometimes there is some unfairness to the rules and that is shown ASAP. The hardest part of this job is conducting Virtual Reality demos for customers. The best part is when they actually get food its great! You will probably gain 15-20 pounds because they ate always feeding you. But you will lose it all in a month or so because if you care about doing you job correctly, you will get stressed out and lose pounds."
bad,Done it for work expeirence when I was at school really enjoyed it met quite a few nice people and the people what come in for food was really polite aswell
bad,Microsoft vendors are a joke.  This place is ran like a factory instead of a business of Microsoft.  The blue badges treat you like you are stupid and no one cares if you work hard.
bad,"I never worked for Microsoft , therefore, I cannot give any examples of how it was to work there. I will fix this once my account comes up and allows me to fix it."
bad,"I found the recruiting team I worked in to be ridiculous. Poorly trained people hired their friends and promoted them, trending the IQ downward and created a culture of in-fighting cliques. Openly, affirmatively caustic. These people just aren't intelligent..."
bad,"I worked on a team where I supported SharePoint. The management of the team was unlike anything i had ever experienced. The management did not care if you failed or succeeded. It was so competitive that getting help was impossible. They do not want you to have overtime, but you are unable to leave with incomplete work. There were no benefits for this team at all."
bad,Good company and good culture place to work and learn more new technologies with improving skills and encouraging people around to learn more. This company has a good culture.
bad,Unequal pay for Women on the team and almost impossible to advance unless you're friends with management. Plenty of restaurants to choose from for lunch. Food was great.
bad,VMC is the worst recruiting firm I have worked for. They give terrible raises and eat up so much of your increase it is insane. I would never work for this company again.
bad,This was a recruiting firm. Messed up a lot on my paychecks. Treated as second class citizens at Microsoft. I don't want to work for a consulting firm again.
bad,"Very bad experience with management, lots of favouritism and very little advancement. People are hard to work with and the culture does not encourage sharing."
bad,"I worked through temp agent ""Kelly"" so my review might be different than others. Everything is discouraging except clean environment. Non-permanent employees are treated like trash. Uncertainty is a common word I can say. Monday 8 hours work, Tuesday no work then Wednesday 10 hours and Thursdays receives email ""closed"". It is not good place for temporary workers at all and Kelly Service does not treat fairly and equally. Be careful to work for Kelly. Some stations are fun to work and some are boring. Heavy pressure from lead and supervisor. Overall, I won't recommend to work as temporary employee. You will be promised long time contract but will be terminated shortly and irresponsibly. Hope innocent employees are saved from vicious staffing agent."
bad,"Re: Life Balance"
bad,"A completely useless experience. I joined the company with high hopes of career advancement. Suffer a while as a product advisor and then move up to Microsoft corporate. But, that will never be the case. If anything the managers try to keep you in your position for as long as humanly possible. Degrade you and give you no support or training. Pay is atrocious for a company that pulls in over 20 billion dollars a year in revenue. "
bad,"Never work in Microsoft as a consultant under SharePoint NYPD project. Very tight deadline, expected to work on all 7 days a week without any compensation otherwise you will be fire in less than 3 months."
bad,"Long hours management is not helpful at all. When question are asked there is a ""lets wing it "" attitude. No time for family."
bad,"Dishonest, management sucks. Managers hire friends with no skills."
bad,"challenging job"
bad,Like must jobs out there they want a puppet. I went in there and I'm the type that wants to work and loves customer service. I was never given a chance to show them that because of the nontraditional way the conduct their business/interviews. I should have known this going in considering the way Microsoft has always done customer service. Product first no matter how flawed they are then customer service.
bad,I am a person that loves culture. If the culture of my work place is great I am usually content. This organization had terrible culture. The employees were always angry and it always seemed like the vendor was trying to cut corners where they could. Employees were usually cheated out of bonuses and pay raises so the company could profit.
bad,The general attitude amongst the co-workers is poor. Most are currently seeking alternate employment.
bad,"Filled with cronyism, backstabbing and middle managers whose goal it is to drive the employees into the ground"
bad,"Great place for engineers to get their start and should stay for 5 years then move on. And, they have great on campus stores and restaurants. I really have nothing else to add."
bad,"I have experienced only and only stress since I joined Microsoft. I felt unwelcome and disrespected every single day. My stress levels are always super high and I am highly demotivated. Managers at Microsoft are running their own show and are not concerned about losing good talent. They ruin your appraisal so you cant change internal jobs and are either stuck with them for a long period or just quite. I hope to get out of here real soon. This company is only good for entry level people or interns. If you are a seasoned, experienced hire please don't come with any expectations to grow here as you may retire before you get promoted!"
bad,"I was there 15 years. I met some very smart people. For that I'm grateful. My experience is that Microsoft is not a merit based organization. You don't get promoted based on your performance. You will need an executive sponsor to work there and get promoted. You need to be on the bench program. Company culture is very toxic and dysfunctional. Candidates beware. If you decide to work there, don't stay longer than three years. The cost of living in Seattle/Redmond area was very costly. You can get the same or better experience at a smaller more nimble software company."
bad,"Initially, must people think Microsoft is a technology company. They are most certainly not this. They are a marketing company that really doesn’t create anything anymore. They simply refresh product graphics and resell.. but underlying technology remains the same. Additionally, the pay isn’t great and most employees are graduates. Very de moralising place to work."
bad,not good company to work for nothing else management is not focused and do not know what is happening around them. I have seen a lot of unqualified employees. company is losing talent
bad,"In my Experience, it was a fight to keep my job every day. I was HAPPY to leave. It was so Competitive between Employees and so High-Stress, I had to quit while Pregnant, because it was stressing me and my unborn child into health issues!!"
bad,"Not impressed. I expected more professionalism, greater internal rapport between agents and management, better communication and an overall greater sense of pride in my place of employment. Since I started in October there have been a number of inexcusable forced changes made by the upper management in regards to Concierge Support, the specific program I was assigned to, and the changes continue to take place on a regular basis, each one hendering our ability to perform our roles adequately according to the stats they require, which also change constantly. I have never worked in an environment of such poor standard. My fellow coworkers are above par, always exceeding customer expectations and yet are still reprimanded by management for minimal error. I could say more but I will leave it at that."
bad,"Low pay, way too much work for low pay, stressful, & too many office politics.  I don't recommend this company to anyone. "
bad,"Very little direction and support from management teams. The company is too big and cannot seem to agree on almost every problem faced with. Too much management and giving misdirection and differing goals for the same metrics. "
bad,They are the most famous developers of software world wide. However the work life balance aspect to a corporation like this one lacks.
bad,"The money is here, but the culture is absolutely caustic to anyone who is not already old buddies with the director and certainly any contract employee is treated like a second-class slave.  This is the place where, if you have good ideas that could help the entire team?...  you had either keep your head down and wait the requisite 3 years before unleashing them... or make them 100% your boss' idea.  If you implement anything on your own, you will be shunned because it makes your management structure look bad because they need the ownership of any improvements."
bad,"Allowes nepotism , and minds bullies. "
bad,"pessima cultura e clima organizacional, pressao e competitividade encorajados ao extremo"
bad,"If you're not a direct employee of this company, but are instead unfortunate enough to work as a vendor ( commonly called a V-dash), you are a second-class citizen."
bad,"Manager and the leads don't care for your career advancement."
bad,"Microsoft's exorbitant costs stifle business, prevent growth, and are a negative for people on reduced or non-existent incomes."
bad,Volt is a terrible company. They lie to you about pay and benefits. They ignore you until its time to renew your contract. They are utterly despicable and you should avoid them like the plague.
bad,"Every few years they claim to change the review system but it's always stack-ranking based on who likes who. There are occasional purges of ICs but middle managers are untouchable, no matter how incompetent."
bad,"The culture is extremely competitive with teams throwing each other under the bus in order to win. Management is extremely passive aggressive and prefers to hire ""yes"" men."
bad,"On a regular basis, People literally get up and walk out because they cannot take it anymore. The stress, the workload, the sense that management does not care about the mental health of the employees. Its a constant flow of employees leaving and a new group coming in."
bad,"The company culture should be clarified and more visible in the workplace so the employees identify themselves with both."
bad,This company is now out of business for a good reason. Poorly ran by management and ownership. They expected way to much from you with little compensation
bad,"I would rather milk goats than ever work for MS again !"
bad,"Worse job experience I've ever had !"
bad,"log in system began case work, learned how to use new systems apps for the job, coworkers easy approachable. there was not a had part of the job , most enjoyed helping customers"
bad,"Management churn is excessive in many areas. New leadership translates to new goals, new structure and a complete reinvention of the wheel. In 18 months I have lost count, but I think we might be on re-org number 7 or 8. Morale doesn't matter in many groups any more and there are serious wolfpacks and clicks to contend with beyond politics, gossip and backstabbing. Diversity employment is preached but ignored and the fraternities force more and more women out the door each month. It is a great place to get your wings but beyond that it is the worst factory you could ever imagine."
bad,"Although I was able to get some management skills this job made it hard to balance work and home life. Top level management were unfair, unwilling to work extra hours, and unwilling to listen and work as a management team"
bad,"Typical day is wasted in CYA activities vs being productive. I have learnt to handle personalities and the politics to get promoted. Middle management is about lip service and checking boxes enforced by senior management. There is a slow effort to change the culture. The hardest part of the job is watching the political environment. You must be aware of all the players and their motivations before you begin working or sharing ideas. "
bad,"Not a lot of room for advancement unless you're in the inner circle, which happens to be all male.  A lot of bad decisions get implemented because of the buddy system."
bad,"If you like being stabbed in the back by your colleagues, out of control managers and cut throat annual reviews then this is the place for you. Benefits are good and the campus is nice."
bad,"I had 3 managers and worked in multiple product development teams, the worst being the ASD team. Managers were the worst I've had compared to other companies I worked before joining Microsoft: they're indifferent and arrogant about their work, they only care to meet budget and resource limits and make a good impression to their VPs. They know little about design and research, nothing about engineering and don't care to collaborate, only to pass down directions from their higher-ups. Incompetent managers are promoted without even knowing how engineers collaborate with design and research."
bad,Great place to work if you want to be part of a 1980s institution. Nice people who have been doing the same jobs for 10 years and all secretly want to work for Apple.
bad,The contract was lost. This was after several upper management changes. Team leaders were not given a voice or allowed to run teams properly and this caused severe division.
bad,"Software development environment was ancient and fragile.  Couldn't get work done for having to keep propping it up.  Developers didn't understand the architecture of their product.  Management didn't care to listen, understand the issues, and deal with them."
bad,"Still in an early growth phase and the right and left hand don't help each other.  "
bad,"Robotic staff, overworked and lacking the inspirational knowledge of the outside world. Full of long-termers 10 years or more the norm, the revolving door is there if you are not a robot, very back stabby culture. Lots of far more interesting places to work with better technology and tenacious people, sadly the larger corporate world is hooked on it like crack and they cant get off due to previous investment..."
bad,I had no opportunity to advance in my job. I worked very hard to build our client base but was never rewarded for the long hours and hard work. I had not received a salary increase in three years at the time of leaving the company. I was retrenched with immediate effect and was not even given 24 hours notice.
bad,"The Trainer i was with was very agitated with me most of the time. The group i worked with swore to much, also very rude. I was warned  my first day from the manager that this group is not always so nice. There was not much chance with that group to stay if they decided they did not like you. I liked what i did, some of the people there were so nice too.  I did find out they started people with a higher pay rate then myself with less experience then i had."
bad,"New cube farm seating style says it all.  Lower pay and efforts to bring in immigrants and not actually hire local women.  Microsoft is the current leader in mediocre senior management,"
bad,"This company is run by a bunch of egos.  Rather than focusing on what is best for the customer, it's a political game.  "
bad,"There is tremendous talk of diversity and inclusion activities, but in my experience these are just words. Anyone who stands up for their D&I needs are forced out. Attempts to move to other teams are sabotaged by HR and managers."
bad,"They literally time everything you do down to the minute and have people getting on you if you are ""not on a call"" for more than 10 minutes i.e. filling out the paperwork for your ticket or trying to troubleshoot an issue"
bad,"Micrososft usually hire to fire them in next couple of years so as to retain their old team.They have culture that manager shall need to give the stack ranking to HR for their team.Most of times, the lowest one will be the new joinee in the team.It is clearly understable that how one guy who joined whithin a year will surpass the existing employess who has worked for more than 10 years."
bad,"Worked in loud, hot server rooms.  No training or advancement.  Bullying and intimidation was rampant.  Abusive workplace environment.  Avoid at all costs."
bad,Sogeti will nickel and dime you any chance they have.  Not transparent at all and hard to talk with management about issues.  Will take your hard earned bonus anytime they can.
bad,Sogeti only cares about their clients and not their employees. It shows in the typical work day in the office. The employees all seem to be unhappy and they don't talk to one another.
bad,"This is the best place for working in IT industry. The senior management is so much supporting and let your career build in a very fruitful manner. There is a very healthy environment in the office. There is too much scope of learning and growing. I am working here for more then 2 years now and I don't even realize how the time spent by. "
bad,"Management is terrible. Very unprofessional Work Environment, Unorganized..Nothing to positive to really take away...AT ALL!!"
bad,I thought working at microsoft I would learn a lot.  I was disappointed.  The technology is limited because you are only allowed to use microsoft products.  The culture is quiet.  You can't get up and talk to another person in the next cubicle.  You have to instant message everyone and then you get into trouble when you miss a message or email.
bad,"Worked in the store in Danbury CT a long time ago."
bad,Too focused on internal perceptions and completely miss the need to put the client front and central.
bad,"Lack of creative culture, Lures you with benefits but sweatshop mentality once you're a full time employee. They have a tendency to promote character assassination to justify dismissal. This is and org that teaches that there must always be one employee that is not hitting targets. Its not about competencies its about Likability at the company. If you chose this as a place to work you'll be engaged daily in trying to keep you job rather than doing your job"
bad,"They promised a 3 yr contract and before a year they laid us off, bad company ethics. Not enough compensation for"
bad,"Perhaps it was because I was a contractor with Microsoft, but I now feel that Microsoft, or at least the groups I worked for, does not treat their contractors well."
bad,"Started work there with a manager who was strict and demanded the best from his employees, but also did his best to support them. New Management came and  it quickly became about employees supporting management instead of the other way around. They offer great benefits (even to part time employees) but your experience there is going to depend on if you are lucky enough to have a great manager or a bad one."
bad,"The culture at Microsoft is favorable if you are female or an immigrant, otherwise beware. It's an ideological echo chamber. Lots of potential opportunity to move within the company, but their loss of status in the tech world is playing out within the ranks with paranoia and protectionism. It has become stale and difficult to navigate. As mentioned, they pay an inordinate amount of attention to a supposed inclusive culture, but the company is increasingly run by HR."
bad,"I work for a vendor company called Novitex at Microsoft; the review above is for Novitex and not Microsoft. I very much enjoy working with the MS employees within my building, however my vendor company does have overly restrictive and illogical policies that interfere with ones personal and work life. "
bad,Once you get in you hear that phrase a lot. I was disappointed with my experience there because that was not evident during the interview process. However once I got there it was obvious. I am not a salesman so I left the company.
bad,"This is a company that have great workers but it does not have a good management. Company does not encourage workers to works outside of their areas, does not worry enough about the quality of its products and does not listen to its customers. I am not sure if it will be able to continue to do well given that is does not have a good answer for two new disruptive technologies, cloud computing and mobile and the continue decline of the PC market."
bad,"Microsoft says all the right things, in the interview and in their internal documentation, but the reality is very disassociated from those words.  Upper management runs amuck, every single thing is office politics, and the entire Company seems to be built on a culture of backstabbing and drama.  Meanwhile the Company treats every utterance as if it's a lawsuit waiting to happen.  So between the threat of being sued and/or thrown under the bus for anything you say, it's a pretty miserable place to work."
bad,"Horribly managed, plagued by disgusting politics. With the exception of some rare and talented people who amazingly manage to survive relatively unscathed, this is a circle of hell, populated by quiet suffering victimized souls and horrible backstabbing cynical people who keep on getting promoted."
bad,"Literally on my 2nd day on the job two co-workers were having an argument about who through whom under the bus.  It evolved into a shouting match.  In my first two months I saw more shouting, and complaining and people threatening to tattle tell on another person's boss.  "
bad,The benefits are good but you would have to be a real politically savvy individual to get anywhere in the culture
bad,Staff saw no benefit to experience. Junior folks asking the questions. Not a knowledgeable group of people asking the questions. No actual hands on business experience.
bad,"I came to Microsoft as a level 62 (SDE II) engineer with about 3.5 years experience. "
bad,"I found Microsoft to be a harsh transition from my previous workplaces. The culture is pretty cut throat, and uninspiring. Microsoft lacked a direction for Skype after the acquisition, and it showed in subsequent events."
bad,"Be sure NOT to transfer from boss to boss inside Microsoft, the next one might NOT like you! This happened a few months ago"
bad,"I was finishing my Master degree in Cyber Security when I got approved to work with Microsoft under Mindtree. Afrer I got approved, they put me without any traning in the position of Sr. Support Engineer which did not have anything to do with my background. All they did was to provide me links for the videos about Microsoft product. Once they realized that the training was needed, they took me out of the project instead. After almost two months of waiting for a new project, they decided to end my contract."
bad,"Microsoft is a cool job co-workers are fun to be around always was their to help you whenever you needed it. "
bad,Not a bad job just very technical and can take up to 6 months before you fully understand how to help customers. I would recommend to anyone who likes a challenge and like dealing with multiple situations
bad,"Couldve been fun, but too remote, not enough people willing to dig in and work .  The work was fun, too much sales getting in the way of doing fun work with clients."
bad,"No life work balance to speak of. If you like that type of environment, then Microsoft is for you. Also, you might ship many of the products that you work on at times"
bad,The production slowed way down as they cut the work force drastically and cut hours. With in weeks we slowed down from making 1600 a day to 40 a day. Made for very slow days and even canceled work days due to over production.
bad,excellent team of people in the kitchen always willing to help and work together to get things done smoothly. would happily go back an work here again.
bad,"We had a good time to work with all members in the team. Had learn new technologies, way of thinking ""out of box experience""."
bad,Work pressure is too high that is the reason i am looking for a job change back to procurement
bad,"If you get on the right team, great place to work.  Unfortunately, the culture at Microsoft is anti collaboration.  They pit developers against developers.  You help another dev out and it hurts your review."
bad,better communication skills
bad,It was alright. They are what they are. It's hard to give an opinion on recruiting firms. They are very tough to work with. I suppose this place was alright compared to other firms i've worked.
bad,"I was promised a position but started in another to get my feet wet,  The manager that made the promise of the other position was fired days later.  I started the job unaware."
bad,Management is terrible and was suggest you leave/quit of you express a passion for products. Management just wants a yes man and to not ask questions some harassment and bullying in the work place.
bad,"It's a wonder things even get done. Roughly 60% of my work time was spent politicking internally for survival, and constant begging to do the right things for customers. Customer obsession is a punchline, not a reality at MSFT."
bad,"Management talks the talk, but does not walk the walk.  Talk of failure being a necessary feature of progress, but only success is rewarded or applies to career growth.  Looking good is more important than actually being good.  This got worse in the later years."
bad,There is no such thing as job security.  Great benefits.  Performance process breads lack of trust and competitiveness within the organization unfortunately.
bad,"horrible company that will dangle a carrot in front of you for many years and then never follow thru. Promise after promise, false promotion and representation of what a career should be."
bad,"Terrible communication especially with management, bad pay, not enough hours, etc. Your role here isn't worth the pay or the stres that this job comes with"
bad,"No internal advancement opportunities, lack of management assistance, poor financial and health benefits, not transparent about financial growth, held to compliance with vendor clients with little support."
bad,"I have been holding several roles as Microsoft vendor and my conclusion is this: you can deliver the results they ask for, you can put as many hours and keep everyone happy, but you are just a resource and will be treated as such meaning they will cut your contract with no advanced notice, provide no recommendations and there is not way you can appeal their decision as you are not an FTE."
bad,"Old software company set in their ways and having trouble keeping up with the times. They are the biggest and think they're the best. Poor management and very disconnected both internally and externally."
bad,Not a great company to work for in terms of Work Life balance. You work long hours with minimal rewards. High stress environment.
bad,The company is an OK one but not comparable with FAANG. It lacks for collaboration and relatively pretty high turnover rate. Job security may be one important factor.
bad,It did not ever matter how much you did to shine.  The machine that is MS will smother any contribution into a simple profit and move along without highlighting or promoting those who do the best for their teams.
bad,"The pressure is hight, the office conditions are not good."
bad,"just bad over all, management are not technical, technicians don't know how to interact with other,  it all  competition all the time. The only good thing was that there is not dress code"
bad,Working here was one of the worst experiences in my career. The only positive thing i took away from this was my coworkers were friendly and tried to help me advance within the company. The management  is old and outdated and dont like anyone trying to change things for the better.
bad,"Went to Microsoft for the technology which remains the primary reason to go there.  Too many high ego, non-collaborative managers to help grow the business.  Poor sales culture focused on cronyism and a distinct lack of customer focus."
bad,worked here for 2 years outside my availability. while new employees get the shift I wanted. Management told me if I didn't like me hours then I should quit. left another job to come here.
bad,Microsoft is the 800lbs gorilla that struggles with the basics. They are unorganized and promote people to a level of incompetence. Then look for others in the group to blame. Good thing they have cash cows like Windows and office to pay the bills because the hardware guys are a joke.
bad,"The people are smart and hardworking, but the culture is toxic. Management encourages unhealthy competition."
bad,Working as a Premier Field Engineer gives you great opportunities to work with multiple companies ranging in size from VERY Small to ones at the top of the list of the Fortune 100 list.
bad,"You will work all holidays, and even in a community outreach / education role, you will work as floor coverage with little to no knowledge of the products."
bad,"Starting back in the mid 1990's, working the for company as a contractor was challenging and very rewarding.  The leadership was strict yet back then the products produced were history makers.  I left MSFT in 2007 after working a fte role.  The manager and group were really good. But they were outsourcing the entire projects to Hyderabad and my chances in keeping employment were not good.  So I left and went back to contracting.  "
bad,"Corporate culture kills the employees, does not foster a team environment, the review process kills the spirit of collaboration - everyone is out for themselves"
bad,"I like the organisation, they have good locations and generally are positive however there are limited opportunities to promote and I am super surprised this engine has forced me to share this information"
bad,"Highered as tech service's analyst. Was promised to have certs provided as part of highering. Then 3 months in, all certs were cancelled. I joined with the specific intent of getting a few more certs and while working in the store, i never got the opportunity and was denied on 3 separate occasions to take time off to do a course which would have helped with the job. "
bad,"Overall it was good working with excellent talented teammates throughout the years. However, the problem I found to be most vexing came from management and the organization. When they shake up the teams or change policies, there is no guarantee that your position will still exist, or if it does, you might be left with no clear direction. On top of that, managed service and contract employees, especially in test, are not often given the chance or consideration for FTE positions even when performing the same job. There is a large amount of bloat in the company. Those with powerful positions and office culture influence will, at times, surround themselves with friends rather than those qualified for the positions. The uncertainty of career advancement may make this a dead end for some people."
bad,"If you don't watch your back, you will find a knife in your back. Can't trust management. Old executive assistants are given license to be nasty. HR will side with management. It's a competitive and nasty work environment.  But they have good benefits!"
bad,"Interesante para construir marca profesional, pero no se llega a hacer una carrera profesional de largo recorrido"
bad,Very difficult to be successful in the OEM Ops organization I contracted for as management didn't even know what they were doing let alone communicate what their objectives were to a consultant.  Very little direction on expectations.  Horrible 6 months!
bad,There are pockets of great opportunities at Microsoft but I do not work in one. They have given so much autonomy to managers that there is zero protection for employees.
bad,It is an ok company to work for. The benefits could be better and the communication needs work.  There is barely any communication unless you reach out to them.
bad,Long unappreciated work hours. Many people with a not my job mentality. Self promoting success achievers vs team win thought process. A ranking and rating system that discards great talent when there is no one left to target and someone has to go.
bad,"This was my second time at Microsoft. My first experience was so amazing that I couldn't wait to go back. However, when I was hired on by a different team, I completely regretted my decision. First of all my manager treated us as second rate employees. We were kept isolated from the team, out of the loop on major decisions, poor communications and inconsistency in our workload. There was no work/life balance, because management didn't trust enough to allow us to work from home. I eventually was laid off because I decided to work from home on a holiday weekend instead of driving an hour and a half just to sit in an office for 8 hours with no work to do."
bad,"Microsoft seemed like the perfect place before I started as an FTE.  Unfortunately, I was transferred to a different group after only ten months because of a department-wide restructuring and was moved into a terrible situation.  My job quickly went from being a great place to work to being a terrible place to work, all within a very short time frame.  "
bad,"There is no room for forward progression unless you have been external talent for at least 5 years, or someone decides to leave.  The promise of opportunity made in the interviews was not and is not accurate."
bad,"Microsoft is very political place to work for, people back stabbing others to get promotion. Management can push someone out just because they want to without any proof of performance issue."
bad,no room for advancement. there is no job culture as a contractor. i recommend not working or involving yourself with this company as i have worked as a contractor before under better conditions
bad,"Poor leadership, dominate team perspectives are all based on Indian culture and have very little to do with the American environment and culture that they work in."
bad,"This place has changed. It ""used"" to be an awesome place to work, but corporate suits took over and turned it into a nightmare. Employees are constantly reminded that they are a disposable asset, the contingent staff are constantly reminded that they are slaves only allowed to play within a specified sandbox and even more disposable."
bad,"I have to be very careful how I make a review!  Microsoft monitors everything that is said about them and they enjoy punishing people if they can figure out who the person is.  The problems that I experienced at this job cannot even be put in words.  There are major money issues with part of their organization that is based out of India.  People owe major amounts of money on their credit card and the customers make it appear that they had no knowledge of contracts with Microsoft to take that much money.  It not only shows the problems with Microsoft, it also has to do with Business Owners themselves.  "
bad,"Terrible work/life balance (it's expected from you to work 60 hours/week). New senior management doesn't have a clue where the ""new"" One Microsoft is going. Advancing stocks with laid off excellent people. New ideas aren't accepted at all. Lost last 15 years with terrible HR decisions and now employees and customers are paying the price. Too many unnecessary acquisitions and nothing really new in past 15 years."
bad,"Should improve innovation, creativity and accountability at leadership level"
bad,"MSFT culture pays lip service to a lot of things. Their benefits are exceptional, but changing (not for the better). Managers turn over about every 18-months. Rarely do they take the time to learn what their people do; they all want to make changes so you can be faster, better, cheaper by bringing in contingent staff versus full time employees if they can. Annually you have to write a book to justify your position. It wastes a lot of cycles. Work, life, balance, is where they pay the most lip service. Good luck keeping your sanity getting ready to have someone back you up while you take vacation, let alone surviving the additional time you'll have to spend to catch up from while you were off. It may not be worth it. Think hard, very hard, before going to work for them. There are better and more innovative places to work if you are looking to work in technology."
bad,"The work is overwhelming, lack of training to employees, no work life balance"
bad,"Check emails and respond to tickets and follow up on the old requests as well."
bad,"While at Microsoft I experienced 3 reorgs in one year, each directly impacted my working situation. By the time I completed my apprenticeship I was filling data visualization request for teams who's members I never met.  Everything was very disorganized and frantic. Even though this is one of the most profitable companies around, I always felt like the rug could be pulled from under me at any time.  Very uncomfortable feeling."
bad,"I worked for cross over and my manager made me uncomfortable I expressed this to him and was written up the very next day . I also had a coworker run her fingers threw my hair and didnt her fired I was told that it was the ""ignorance to my demographic """
bad,"Concurrence entre employés poussée à l'extrême"
bad,Microsoft is a very large company with many levels of employment. However if you dream to reach those higher levels  you may find it extremely difficult to advance with 4000 coworker in just your department seeking 1 of 100 possible promotions ranging from team lead to section manager so about 25k to 120k difference. these positions rarely open as advancement is usually based off how many people have recently quit instead of opportunity creation
bad,"If you enjoy being expected to turn on your laptop and work all hours in the evenings and weekends as well as a 50 hour week then this is the place for you. Temps treated like outsiders , not even allowed at xmas parties or work team building events unless you pay for yourself. Poor company and poor management"
bad,"Microsoft is a very ""touchy-feely"" kind of place. You need to be very careful who you talk to and on your toes 110% of the time."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"Non-Productive, No work-life balance, no leadership qualities with the managers and No proper performance guidelines and everybody in higher roles think they own the company and dictate terms accordingly"
bad,"Terrible work life balance. Worked extended hours, weekends and during vacations. The culture at Microsoft is marked by politics and back-stabbing. Getting the job done was more important than doing the right job or a good job."
bad,"The culture at Microsoft is second-best. These people are bright and hard working but they settle for less than stellar and that is why Microsoft software no longer shines, or leads."
bad,"Microsoft is still on the cutting edge of many technologies. From a tech standpoint it is an exciting place to work.  It is fast-paced with outrageous growth potential. For employees that are looking for a secure work environment, where hard work is appreciated, Microsoft is NOT for you.  Microsoft has no problem recruiting individuals, relocating them, and then letting them go. If you believe big companies have no heart, it is definitely true at Microsoft."
bad,"On the phone ALL day"
bad,"Prefer not to comment on the issues at this job. Would not recommend it to anyone. Management is a joke and not trained well themselves. Stay clear of this company, it is not what one thinks"
bad,"Efforts wont be rewarded. After selling more than anyone, I saw no recognition or pay raise. Take pics of your numbers and prepare to leave asap. Your efforts wont be rewarded at the retail level."
bad,"Microsoft is a successful retail company that thrive on new hardware and software technology. Working with new products and POC projects are exciting and also nerve racking. Deadline is short and work hours get extended as the deadline nears. "
bad,"Very long hours with very little appreciation.  Management doesn't want to hear concerns or opinions from employees; just do what they say,"
bad,"Pays well, this is a very cut throat atmosphere."
bad,Take great care in the quality of candidate experience from initial point of contact to confirmation of interview day.  Maintain minimum level of compliance against candidate service level agreements and candidate satisfaction targets.
bad,"Egypt COE is a one man show that doesnt fall under any global Microsoft policies "
bad,"The company as a whole provides is enjoyable. But the department in which I work (Office 365 Onboarding Center) is not. The project is  new and the management consists of people thrown together from other departments. All eyes are on the project as it may change the way business is done from a customer service standpoint."
bad,"I joined Microsoft sometime after the Bing launch as an 'opportunistic statistics hire'.  It was a pleasant place to work, with intelligent and thoughtful co-workers dedicated to the job."
bad,"Do not be taken into contract with Microsoft, unless you are prepared for a break neck pace, poor compensation for your effort and to be lost in the wood work as you are only going to be an expendable item in the large machine. If you plan to perform better then everyone else, don't, you'll be removed by politics and back channeling that will result in your ultimate cancellation, if you are looking for experience? you wont find much mindless tasks will be provided for you until you are eventually made obsolete by programing."
bad,There's very little opportunity to grow your career when org changes happen every 90 days and you're reporting to someone else. The health benefits are also not much greater than any other company (and it used to be the best in the nation).
bad,"overall OK when divide compensation by working hours, but divide your compensation by 70 not 40 when figuring out $/hour."
bad,"I've been a part of Microsft now for better or worse of three years. The overall work environment here is toxic, political, and just dishearting, given what the company sells itself to be to the public. From the words of 10+ year blue badge veterans I've gotten to know intimately at Microsoft be warned...THIS COMPANY DOES NOT VALUE THE INDIVIDUAL. I've witnessed workers from the Xbox dev division to the Surface Pro dev division work for little to no gratitude from their higher-ups. Things we thought we'd only see in movies about lazy and soul-crushing managers beating down our heroes. The only difference from the film to real-life...often there is no justice or ""they will get theirs"" in the end."
bad,"Microsoft has a lot of opportunities and a lot of different products. So you can move around regularly, and most people do, and try different things."
bad,"Microsoft is a huge company so whether you'll like it or not will depend on which department you land in. Also, there are continually reorganizing so you may end up in a different department or have a different manager after you get hired on. Some people love it, some don't."
bad,Great company as a whole but the retail environment is horrible. They give amazing benefits but the work atmosphere is toxic with unprofessional managers. You don’t get paid enough for what they want you to do on a daily basis and ask more of you  than your job description ask for without questions. I would consider working for a different position in corporate but never for their retail again.
bad,"On the road 100% of the time.  The leadership is very challenging.  The VP states she is for diversity and strong culture, but she allows the few toxic people to be unprofessional and abusive.  Many good resources have left or been forced to leave because of the very abusive people on the team.  It is alarming that other senior leaders haven't taken notice."
bad,It is a fun working environment. On the days where the mall is slow the store is slow. Although I worked during the holiday season there were still some slow days. Management did show favoritism to some employees vs. others.
bad,"Microsoft on a whole seems like it might be a good place to work. The recruiting vendors that work with Microsoft do NOT seem to know how they should handle actual professionals or what the job requirements vs customer requirements actually should entail. Also, their insistence on not providing contractors equipment and having the vendors maintain and provide the equipment is completely ridiculous. It causes an extreme loss in productivity starting with setting up the equipment on to having equipment that is not properly tested and under-performs when using the massive amount of applications needed to work as an engineer for Microsoft."
bad,Every shift I had to answer what I could have done better today.  Terrible!  Culture is terrible with retail store manager being sexist and abusive to employees.
bad,You don't get yearly raises in this company. Managers give good jobs to friends. Managers blame you for their failings and expect you to coach failing techs for them.
bad,"Leaders were only incentivized to create their own kingdoms (the larger the staff; the more likely they will keep their job).  There is a certain ""Microsoft Speak"" you have to learn to move into senior and executive management... agree with everything your boss says...or you are gone!"
bad,this company doesn't respond what employee ask or need. Hourly working requirement is very strict and it makes employees feel being used. It's typical vendor company for Microsoft
bad,"I had worked for the company for almost 9 years.  Over that time I saw many changes that were not ""worker friendly"".  Unfortunately, it is a reality of todays workforce.  As competition ramped up, benefits are cut and expectations and stress gets higher.  Micro managing the business from several layers of management began to take over the job and it became harder to accomplish what needed to be done.  More recently, restructuring and layoffs have made job security part of the additional concerns.  As with any job, the job can only be as good as your direct manager.  With the restructuring, the company has new and in some cases unqualified managers in role. It's more important that the manager meet PC criteria than putting the best candidate in place.  This is probably not unique to Microsoft, but it was a great place to work at one time.  I wouldn't say that today."
bad,"Pressure to make your number, no matter what! Poor management. Lot's of backstabbing, Racial diversity non existent. "
bad,I do not have an opinion that I would like to add to this question.  While I have only worked a Microsoft for 1.5 years I do not feel I have enough time working there to give an opinion.
bad,lake of management skills. employees are very stressed an they require a lot of work extra . career path is very slow and the potential to grow is hard.
bad,Microsoft doesn't set people up to succeed.  What is provided lacks information necessary to do your job.  There is a lot of internal competition and loyalty/integrity were rare.  Worst experience in my 20 year career.
bad,"There's good people and free soda, coffee, and tea but not much else. There's also a ping pong table, pool table, restaurants nearby so finding lunch is easy."
bad,There are a lot of cultural problems and technical debt at Microsoft Aliso Viejo office. Many of its product lines are not doing well. Heavy political infighting and constant re-orgs.
bad,"Management can be bad and ruin your career. Not happy with the treatment."
bad,The management is good for Aditi Technologies. But the pay is low and they want their engineers to work as if they are paid a higher salary. There is pressure from all sides.
bad,"Position was interesting and projects were challenging as well as highly visible."
bad,"Estimulante mas até certo nível. "
bad,"I get to talk about all sorts of Microsoft products and services. It's usually a fun time in the unpredictable setting of New York, the environment welcomes all sorts of characters both employed or as customer or simple passerby's. I've had the privilege of dabbling in the most basic of customer service duties to more advanced, branch-out roles such as inventory, administration, merchandising, and technical support...Not many places allow for such well-rounded growth."
bad,The team I was in merged with another team. The management off the team that we merged into is in the process of eliminating / laying off our team members.
bad,This company is going down hill very fast. Managers punish you and don't keep promises. Not a real sales environment and not a good place for gaining sales experience.
bad,Environement de travail tres competitif - peu de collaboration
bad,"Due to competitive work environment, peers often throw their peers under the bus to appear more intelligent."
bad,"A new environment in customer service, I enjoyed the face to face interaction with customers. Great beginning place to work."
bad,They are a template consulting company that treats you like a drone with a number.  You come into work and leave without any interaction from anyone.
bad,"Too much of politics which is also accepted by some leaders in social conversations but nothing has been done to change it. "
bad,"working for forever 21 was not something I wanted to do but I was young and I needed a job and I love working at stores that just opened up, but that store was stressful and annoying most days"
bad,"I don't know if I had bad luck, but the impression I had of the company was that it was as any other more traditional company with a techy look. There was a videogame room that no one used but to have a phone conversation with intimacy and a fusball that I just used a couple of times and at lunch time."
bad,"No work life balance"
bad,"Employees are very unhappy, with Gates departure in 2007 company has seen a shift away from technologists to financial folks. Instead of future vision the company totally ONLY drives towards quarterly profits. There must be balance and it is not there ...long term prospects are grim as Apple, Google, LinkedIn, Amazon, IBM and EMC/VMWare out innovate Microsoft."
bad,"Wow, don't ever accept an offer/job unless you actually meet or know the team you are going to go to...Got exited and moved for an exiting adventure only to be severely disappointed."
bad,"I don't know if it is different in MS corporate, but the retail locations are just like any other retail job. Long hours- usually 9 hour days, not including whatever your travel may be. While employees make no commission, they are still pushed to basically hound customers to try and get them to buy. You never actually get 40 hours a week as a full-time employee, as they leave 2-3 hours ""just in case you have to stay with a customer"" to avoid giving overtime. While yes, you have PTO, you are less likely to get weekend requests off. "
bad,Ben je FTE dan is alles mogelijk bij Microsoft ben je Vendor dan niet
bad,Great place to work if you are on the correct team.  Training is self paced not instructor led and dependent upon team budgets.  Judged upon writing your self worth.
bad,"The division was terrible. The leader would have ""all hands"" meeting.  Leader would show up late, unprepared and tie up people for half a day."
bad,"Had a bad work experience at Microsoft due to a boss who demonstrated passive-aggressiveness , favoritism, unclear direction and poor communication. When issues / concerns were brought up with HR - did not receive proper support."
bad,"Teamwork is just a word thrown around to make newbies feel comfortable. However, it doesn't take anyone long to realize that the only way to succeed at MS is to back-stab your fellow employees (thanks to stack-ranking culture) and become a sycophant to management. Every department is in competition with each other, to the point that inter-departmental cooperation is non-existent. Butts-in-seats was more important than work actually done. It's no wonder every product MS pinches out is late and uninspired. "
bad,"I was shocked at the infighting, selfishness, and indifference to cultivating great teams or collaborative results. The organizational accountabilities and management were focused solely on their own narrow deliverables, not the broader corporate or customer goals or outcomes. My manager for the last two years was singularly focused on his personal advancement, regularly disparaging other teams and people. A truly toxic culture."
bad,"If you are thinking this is the product arm of microsoft, then you are wrong. This is just like any typical services company."
bad,Cut throat completion and long working hours. needs to work for day and night due to multinational locations . Excessive travelling. Pay package and other facilities are good but no work life balance.
bad,"As a contractor, I never had a 'steady' project or 'steady' work; I was always passed around to various designers to 'assist' and 'help' on whatever they were working on."
bad,"Great opportunity but it would be better if you were treated like a human and person not just the ""worker"" employee by management. I think every situation should be handled case by case and they lack the ability to do that as a company sometimes"
bad,You must make sure you find a group that fits you because the culture varies from group to group and a good fit is needed to succeed.
bad,Most of the people I know who work at Microsoft are just there still because of the golden handcuffs not because they want to do anything cool.  I feel this is really holding back the company from doing innovative work.
bad,"Salaries are good at Microsoft and if you are in a good group this could be a great place to work."
bad,"No Job Security. Working from home was great. Great Pay great working hours, over all great to support Windows/ Microsoft Office 365 Product line from home."
bad,"My day to day interaction with other artist was low stress and amicable, but there was no structure for promotion or increased compensation for performance or more responsibility. There was also a concerted effort on the part of management and Microsoft to keep salaries and compensation hidden to obscure the inequality the was rampant in the studios salaries."
bad,I was expecting more from a great company. The upper management treats its contracting workers like slaved labor. Beware of the Las Colinas location
bad,"Its a good place to work, but no work life balance. Many opportunists  to learn but mismanagement makes the employees to feel dis satisfied. Many competitions and prizes are there to feel enthusiastic"
bad,"It used to be great company to work for but has been on steep decline for few years."
bad,"No work life balance"
bad,Ok company to work for with great benefits and ok Advancement.Best part for me of the job is the people i worked with. The hardest part of the job is working with the management.
bad,I've worked for a few vendor companies. Some are better than others.
bad,Management has very poor managerial skills. Treat employees as objects not people. Promises made but not kept. Very disappointed in a company this size. Been in the technology business for 20+ years and have never been treated the way Microsoft treats its staff.
bad,"•	Member of Microsoft’s lead Operations Consultant Team. Successfully lead the completion of eight large, multi-factorial and multi-million projects "
bad,If you are a contract employee they will terminate your contract without ANY notice and without fair discussion of job performance!
bad,My typical day at work involves exciting and challenging work. I love the work I do but I am unhappy with the way the team is managed. We do not get any sort of appreciation or motivation from the manager. He does not care for the morale and motivation of the team. My team members are fun to work with.
bad,Served only full time Microsoft employees on Microsoft campus.  Lots of wellness checks and referral management for employees to follow up with specialists.
bad,"•	Produce the Daily Windows CE Build for multiple phones"
bad,"Worked as a Product Feedback Analyst (PFA)\Senior Associate – My job role involves analyzing the documentation done by the Microsoft agents regarding customer’s technical queries on Windows OS, MS Office and other Microsoft products."
bad,"The job wasn't hard, but the restraints for the job are stressful and the requirements change constantly so you have to adjust frequently to change. I wasn't impressed with their training. Training consisted of four weeks in class. The training changed on us three times so by the time we hit the floor and started taking calls I was confused because the calls I was taking were calls that I wasn't trained to handle. Time restraint for the calls were nine minutes and very difficult to manage due to the lack of understanding customer issues, and the real problem so I could direct them to the correct engineer and/or technician. I enjoyed helping customers with their issues and I learned a lot about microsoft products. My co-workers were great helping with issues and products I wasn't familiar with. Their were some managers that were great to work with and others that were difficult and did not help but would increase the stress levels. The pay did not suit the environment, it was very low pay for the increasing stress and the high call volume. There is a very high turnover rate with this company."
bad,"Was here as a contractor, co-workers seem to hide knowledge and very competitive. I will go back as a full time employee not as a contractor."
bad,"benefits and pay are ok. it's nice to have an office and the work is interesting, but you're going to work like crazy. It's tough to move ahead even if you're a rock star."
bad,The company doesn't value content creators and editors. It is getting out of the content business and moving the bulk of its content workers to remote teams.
bad,I spent two tours at Microsoft and have a demonstrated history of success at the company. I left both times because of the rampant and damaging psychological abuse that pervades the entire company.
bad,"It's not a career place anymore, it's just a job.  The loyalty aspect on both sides is gone.  I miss the 'evil empire', it was a better experience, better products were produced."
bad,"poor management, lazy and sometimes incompetent coworkers, mostly vendor/contractor staff that has little to no training. Poor documentation of the network and services and sometimes even teams not knowing how their services function at a basic level. Managers often have the expectation of high output with little understanding of how to get there and prefer to stand behind you and whip the sled dogs rather than get in front and help pull the sled with the team."
bad,"Diese ""Ansammlung diverser regional verantwortlicher Spezialisten"" führt zwangsläufig früher oder später zu Problemen in der Work Life Balance, , mit Compliance Regeln, mit Vorgesetzten (die die Erreichung sehr kurzfristiger Ziele bevorzugen) und in der Einschätzung der eigenen Performance."
bad,"If you think you can survive a 100% political environment, where what you do count way less than who you are working for, that is your place. Your happiness will depend completely on your manager so be careful and interview her/him well. Hr does not count beyond bureaucratic processes. Jobs are focused 100% on execution. Changes on strategy, new innovative ways of doing things and out-of-box- thinking is normally not welcome if they are totally connected  with the execution."
bad,"my work with microsoft is what made me realize that contracting and workforce solutions is garbage and not sustainable. I was originally hired on for a 2 year contract with a small group to help resolve issues with their SLA, of which microsoft was horrendously out of. We resolved their issues within 5 months; instead of bonuses or reward for our good work or more permanent placement for our ability to resolve issues- we got laid off. "
bad,Really ask a lot of questions during your interviews.   The culture was important for me but I really should have asked more questions about work life balance which is important when working salary.
bad,"Micromanagement, zero autonomy, disjointed/sloppy sprint planning..."
bad,"The competitive nature tends to promote back stabbing.  If you excel at your job, you need to make up new stuff to do to put you ahead of others. Employees can get lost in trying to one-up their coworkers with useless projects, wasting time and money."
bad,"One learns to manage time well here"
bad,"Not a positive culture for introverts, a one size fits all attitude towards personality types.The low partitions made it very noisy and hard to concentrate, especially for introverts, but management didn't care."
bad,"Be mindful that this is a large corporation and no one cares about you. If someone can pitch your idea as theirs, they will. If someone has not put you as their top priority then forget about getting their attention. There is a severe lack of empathy."
bad,Atos works  as a contractor for Microsoft that treats the contract company somewhat badly. Microsoft likes to lead by fear and intimidation at least that's how the Data center Microsoft management was to the employees of our company. .
bad,Microsoft has always had the perception of being arrogant and difficult to work with. This is part of the culture. The new CEO was in the process of introducing a cultural change to Microsoft.
bad,"Always on, direction of company and daily job challenging and changing all the time.   Focus on the wrong things, everything is driven off of Azure, everything."
bad,"Graduate leadership program is not organized and structured well enough. There is no protection from being redundant. HR is not helpful. Sometimes decisions take forever to be implemented. On a positive side, there are a lot of bright people and you can always find people willing to help/advise you."
bad,"This position afforded me two great bits of experience - first, I became proficient at creating and managing complex Excel workbooks, relying heavily on functions to automate what were previously manual QA checks."
bad,"Retail - so helping customers is your number one priority of course. The job itself is not bad, but management direction can be poor or not communicated quite often and you feel out of the loop. Benefits are the only reason to put up with the lack of growth and stress."
bad,Good work place with many talent people. Learned a lot new technologies. Had chance to use many different technologies.
bad,"great job, with great benefits, however the upper management that is not in the stores does not support the teams in the retail stores or the hard work they do on a daily basic"
bad,"A day at work consisted of a lot of break fix issues.  I repaired all of them time and again.  "
bad,"Global Leader company . Outstanding facilities. The leaders has global influence . Strong company culture, but little openness to aggregate partners coming from merged or acquired companies"
bad,"The experience was good the local leadership manages account team by excel spread sheets not customer needs and market trends."
bad,SW company trying to become  HW company with too many in management not understanding how to make that happen.  Te culture is more geared to risk averse behavior; everyone needs to feel 'involved' in any decisions; this slows down decision making process and at times cripples the company.
bad,"Going through a lot of growing pains right now with the new leadership. Like other tough times, they will come out of it. Been with the company for 15 years."
bad,"Not organized, management needs training, unable to prioritize, take on too much."
bad,"I have loved most of the role I have held at Microsoft. The work place can be very dynamic and rewarding. I have had plenty good managers and have met many very nice and enjoyable coworkers and peers. However, my position(s) have been outsourced two out of my last three contracts, That is the hardest part about working at Microsoft is the uncertainty and instability of working as a vendor."
bad,"I loved my time at Microsoft and am grateful for all the wonderful people with whom I worked. We all worked towards making life easier and changing the world through technology. However, the management finally drove the company into the ground. It is a shame that they could not have had a longer term focus and spent more effort on developing the people. So, Microsoft has now gone the way of many companies in the past and is now irrelevant in the marketplace. Technology alone cannot keep companies alive. People keep companies."
bad,"The review and compensation system is a product of upper management culture, and is toxic at all levels. Benefits are great, so good for family oriented types, but work/life balance isn't great, so good luck spending any time with your family."
bad,"It feels like a great place to work at first, but the constant pressure and chaos begins to take its toll. I've heard stories of a few good departments, but the majority of the people I know who currently work there, or who have worked there, are deeply unhappy and constantly stressed to the point that their health was impacted and they ended up in hospital. In 8 years as a full-time employee, I had 11 changes in who I reported to. In addition, the yearly performance reviews are graded on a curve and there are quotas to give a number of ""bad"" reviews. Managers 2 levels about your own, can affect your score. Your individual success is usually at the cost of someone else. You are also penalized if you stay with the same team for more than about 4-5 years. This results in lots of employees transferring around and becoming masters of nothing. I've also worked with the worst managers of any company in my career. Little to nothing is done to remove bad managers either. I've seen a manager fired, and then hired back as a contractor. You may see great reviews about Microsoft being a great place to work, but keep in mind that many employees have never worked for other companies and are also afraid to tell the truth."
bad,"Good people, no structure and Management, it is all about the number. Very little collaboration with good people as everyone is driven to exceed targets. Other large organisations I worked for realised its about teamwork."
bad,": A poor company culture may not seem like a deal breaker, but it should be. Recently, we’ve seen a handful of examples where company culture has significantly handicapped public perception.  Even if a company’s poor culture hasn’t played out publicly, it can be bad for your career. It’s well known that a positive company culture can drive financial performance and a productive workforce. Therefore, a negative culture can do the exact opposite."
bad,"It was okay, training insufficient for role being provided, they have trouble dealing with associates whom may have anxiety issues. How much more s hould i say? i regret saying yes to this at akk,"
bad,"Microsoft has great benefits but that's where the pros end. Management and movement into higher positions from your starting point is extremely political. Does not matter how good you are only how much you can kiss up to store managers. No work life balance as it is retail. They say its ""one Microsoft"" but corporate gets a lot more stay fit benefits as well as they look down on retail employees so your chance of moving into corporate are zero to none."
bad,Bean counters run Microsoft HR and management.  The company has no commitment to dedicated employees who devote their lives to an ideal Microsoft no longer supports nor lives up to anymore.
bad,"Microsoft was a great place to work, and to build excellent software when Bill Gates owned the majority of the company. Customer focus and employee satisfaction were both very important. Now, short term profits and managing up (to get your bonus) are the two most important things at Microsoft."
bad,"I worked for Microsoft for many years.  I was excited initially and then it became very poltical.  Each team I moved to hoping for something different ended up no better than one I was leaving.  At the end, I lost all desire to work and took a less paying job outside that I would enjoy."
bad,"Cut throat culture.  Competitive and employees will blame shift to get visibility.  Not a team environment.  No collaboration, cohesiveness.  Each man for himself."
bad,This was the worst place I ever worked in my life.  The prestige of having Microsoft on my resume and that I was smart enough to be accepted to work there when I was 50 years old (and the company had a reputation for not hiring older workers) flattered me enough that I took the job.  Just because you can doesn't mean you should.
bad,"shift work schedules, data center process and procedures clearly defined, good positive culture. Hardware and Software compliance ticketing system with expectation from system owners."
bad,"management is not good"
bad,"It's Microsoft, so you work with loads of smart people. But, it's very competitive and my group was very poorly managed. I had no interest in staying longer than a year."
bad,"Its very political and not too much room to grow or innovate"
bad,Management teams at MSFT sucks. Managers have no ability to influence team members. People in Silicon Valley campus leave every week...
bad,"Good work-life balance with fun co-workers, but department lacked transparency and ability to challenge us as designers. Insight Global lost their bid to renew their contract with Microsoft shortly after I joined their team and said we would not have to worry about job security, but that was not the case."
bad,"Only for once in a life time it can be experienced. But for long time it is not sustainable. And very stressful job. Specially if you did not work with customer facing job before, it will be harder for you"
bad,"The vendor company I worked for hired myself and a co-worker of mine to manage a team of new recruits to provide some relief to and increase publishing output to xbox video on xbox live. "
bad,"Microsoft has an up or out view of the world."
bad,"From my perspective, Microsoft is a well-established corporation which has basically been riding its laurels into the current technology space. It has horrible/non-existent processes in place which contribute to the sometimes overwhelming detriment to productivity. There is also a very defensive/sensitive culture, which is exacerbated by the lack of individuals who really care about what they are doing. Management is generally horrendous and barely has a grasp on what is going on. Development of employees is also at an all time low. Soo much so it's scary to actually see where some of the more senior engineers are on a technological competency scale. There are of course exceptions but, generally speaking, they are few and far between. I'll leave my feedback at that. One look into the internals of Microsoft, especially the Xbox org, will speak for itself."
bad,"as with most HUGE companies, the culture is set by the individual department/organization you work in.  So it varies widely.  I would stay aware from World Wide Pricing and Licensing (WWLP), any of the product organizations would be challenging and fast paced and you would gain great transferable skills."
bad,"Great environment to work, great co-workers. A lot of incentives, and employee appreciations."
bad,"This Job was a dream at first. During the holidays there was a wonderful buzz in the air. A great full happy staff. Which soon as we finished out the holidays our Temps were let go without a moments notice. The moral went down and people were force to sell sell sell!. I understand were a company but it was suppose to be about the customer experience not ""What did they buy"". I feel let down that we let personal high school ""clicks"" in to our professional work place. Managers have there favorites and if your not one work is not fun for you. In the end Microsoft Retail starts off great and leaves you with a feeling of ""You don't have my back""."
bad,"dal punto di vista delle giornate lavortive, si sviliuppano molto velocemente e i professionisti che sono lì da tempo ti aiutano a crescere stimolandoti ad essere autonomo."
bad,"You're treated as a rowdy teenager on a school trip. No respect or attempt to train, they just throw you at the nearest employee and let them attempt to train you instead. Aside from the leads, your co-workers consist of angsty young adults who make any and all attempts to avoid extended interaction. Depending on the game you get and the people you end up with the day could range anywhere from massively entertaining to monotonous agony which, combined with the minimum wage and zero-hour contract, makes this a job the average person wouldn't keep for more than a few months. Always did wonder how a job like this would play out, and it turns out it was almost exactly what I expected."
bad,"Excellent company, excellent pay. However be prepared for the range of typical large company issues. While you may be well taken care of, it may be frustrating finding your way through large networks of teams to get your job done."
bad,"Microsoft Services is the consulting, technical support, and customer service arm of the world’s leading Software Company. The organization helps customers and partners discover and implement high value Microsoft solutions that generate rapid, meaningful, and measurable results. With its global partner network and support infrastructure, Microsoft Services enables the successful adoption, deployment, and use of Microsoft solutions and technologies for all customers, from the individual to the enterprise. Microsoft Services is designed to provide the right scope of services at the right time, including localized support solutions for businesses and consumers around the world."
bad,"Rather than going hour by hour through every day, focus on a few main tasks, and describe how you go through those tasks in a typical week. Be sure to focus on duties that are relevant to the position for which you are applying"
bad,all of our coworkers help each other. The supervisor is very bad. High knowledge of the subject High security and protection Low salary and complex work.
bad,"Good team; however, Rylem was not as competitive in salary and benefits for the Microsoft on site team as other companies are. So this was a drawback but the experience working at Microsoft was very challenging and rewarding making it desirable."
bad,It is like any other assembly job but I want a more fulfilling experience that will open more more doors so I put my two weeks in because it just felt like another dead end job. Also way to much of my money went missing during each pay period which made no sense.
bad,"very poor training they gave. more like a high school then workplace."
bad,"Initially the job is exciting and you get to learn a lot of new things, but management is fairly horrible. The team you work with are very accepting and easy to get along with but depending on who you become friends with management has a strong bias and will negatively review you for it."
bad,"Business Analysis and Project Management activities in agile environment. Agile and BA coaching to other teams. Product Backlog refinement. Work with engineering, operations and business to ensure solution development is aligned with business goals, adding value to the business."
bad,"The Training we were initially given was dismal. We were pushed out on the floor and literally had to learn and fend for ourselves. "
bad,"This is a horrible company that has since been bought out."
bad,"The benefits/pay were all very good.  The stress levels were through the roof.  No adequate training before being thrown into phone queue.  Team leads do not care about their team, only the numbers.  I have seen more than one team member break down from stress more than once.  Adults, crying in their cubes.  Team Leads did not show any compassion.  "
bad,"Solely managed the New Software Installation Group including the hiring and educating of technicians.  I wrote and instigated new databases and operating parameters to speed up install and delivery time of new PC's.  Learned how and when to lead, follow or step aside."
bad,Overall a fun place to work but poor management makes it not as enjoyable to stay. If it was better managed it would be a good place to work because it's a very laid back environment for a sales position.
bad,"Everyone is in their office all the, nobody talks to each other. Work life balance is good but the time spent at work is excruciating. Team lunches were awkward because nobody talks to each other for months."
bad,"it,s very good to learn this job Microsoft work and i enjoy when i work at this job"
bad,It was good work experience. I was able to extend my IT skills into actual applications in tasks of making a bot. I really enjoyed being mentored by the staff members and working with other students. A particular stand out from the work-experience to me was designing a brochure for Microsoft since it allowed me to demonstrate my creative ideas with the team and staff.
good,"I found high quotas, lack of leadership and not a good experience. The team was not well led, not a lot of training and no ramp up time. Drink from the firehouse and hope you make it."
good,Fast paced environment with very demanding stakeholders & deadlines.  Work life balance very difficult.  Bi-annual review cycle where employees are required to write your own review.
good,"Either in corporate or in the stores, Microsoft Retail is a joke. Apple literally pays you for what you're worth and you deal with exponentially less. You have little job opportunities to move upwards. Unless you know the right people at the right time, you're stuck in a dead end job that pays so far beyond market value that you can barely afford to pay rent."
good,"Nice coffee. Co-workers not supportive. Treat contractors like they're invisible. They hold the carrot of hiring you full time, but it never happens, unless you're from India."
good,"Retail is always trying to be like corporate but it never will be. They will talk about moving up and advancements but really, they will have you doing all the work for the fraction of the pay. They talk about being diversified by even if you help make them a lot of money, improve their business and overall grow the stores you will be looked over for the next gay candidate. Promises aren't something they keep for their workers, just barely for their customers"
good,"Unrealistic expectations for new hire sales, especially in limited opportunity area. First Line leadership not well prepared for new role. Lack of local management focus on such things as badging for appropriate customer visits, no follow through on mentoring, complete lack of respect from first line manager toward skilled and talented personnel. Attempting to raise awareness in leadership was to no avail, work environment was toxic. Best thing I ever did was leave."
good,"The company itself says they promote from within- however they are extremely bias. If your not part of the in crowd, there you are just a number and not recognized for your contributions to the company, further more you are not and never will be promoted- without being in the circle of close nit employees."
good,"My interiew did not included the fact that I was expected to work the retail floor and make sales,  I had a immature manager who was more focus on having her butt kissed than performance.  For me it was not a job recommended for a mature person."
good,If you want think Microsoft 24/7 and have no life... This is the job for you. Microsoft is a very challenging place to work and the managers are all just worried about bonuses.
good,"I have little good to say about this position."
good,"The best job skill is not really doing anything, but making a lot of noise."
good,"They stress work life balance, but they continue to cut headcount and except you do to more with less. This is stressful and burns people out. Highly political and teams lack trust. very competitive"
good,On the Inside Sales Cloud Services Mangers are very poorly in resources.They have no clue how to to follow the strategic changes of company directions
good,"Cuthroat and unfair management, poor management ,,,,they constantly look for ways to replace you with cheaper Microsoft employees from India, partners or contractors"
good,I would only recommend people who are slightly interested in the tech field to get this job. Other than that I would steer clear away from this job. The turnover rate is horrendously high because of the lack of management and hours they provide. People are nice but this job doesn't get many bills paid off. If you're here for more of the experience and not for the money (not like they really give you that many hours to begin with) then this is the right job for you.
good,"MRI of Southern Wisconsin area, had a very hostile environment. Owner of this franchised business was very hot headed and he was not a fun person to be around. Never knew where you stood with him."
good,"Microsoft is kind of Ok place to work.."
good,"The job was interesting. My co-worker/lead was great (a contractor).  The manager was very nice, but was so overworked, she didn't have time to meet and was rarely in her office."
good,"Microsoft is a great company with tons of folks highly passionate about their area, technology, pushing the envelop, etc. Microsoft is in a major change that seeks to and I believe will long-term, improve the culture, quality and execution of Microsoft solutions and services in the mobile-first, cloud-first arenas."
good,"A typical day at work consists of the managers constantly watching you and forcing you to go up and talk to people even when a person isn't at all interested in their products. I learned a few key things about hardware and software. Management are all very pushy and will fire you if you don't talk to people the first two seconds they walk up. Favoritism tactics and they constantly bash Apple, but say that they don't. The core values are good, but no one follows them. If your a seller and go getter and like to constantly have a managers watch over you, then this is the perfect job for you!"
good,"Sweatshop environment, with no regard to work-life balance. They pit you against your peers, and backstabbers and brown-nosers win. It used to be a good fun environment but since hiring upper management from Wal-Mart, the company is run like Wal-Mart. No value for talent, middle managers self justify their worth. They want to be seen as innovators, but no real innovation is recognized or appreciated. "
good,"Good team is good."
good,"I loved my job at Microsoft.  I had a great deal of autonomy and flexibility in my schedule The constant change to our business processes provided a steady stream of challenges.  However, older employees who are not all about climbing the corporate ladder are not respected.  Unless you are changing positions every 3 years, you are not viewed as valuable."
good,"Microsoft is just another company."
good,"When I was there the culture was very cut-throat.  Stack ranking was used to pit employees against each other.  "
good,The people were the most unpleasant aspect of the position.  Decisions were made without consulting the team & very little communication as to what was going on & why.
good,"Culture reflected using language like customer obsessed, growth mindset, and we win as a team.  Manage on duty stayed in the back of house and left others to deal with customers.  Growth mindset was used to bully others into following whatever half-baked notion floated in manager's head that day.  Never disagree or will end up as the whipping boy and eventually terminated."
good,"Working at Bing for me was an extremely competitive, challenging environment.  I did however enjoy the process of learning & implementing incredibly detailed software toolchains & comfortably sank into most hours at my workstation without issue.  Office politics were tough & quite opaque, thus being laid off was something I got over relatively quickly."
good,"Beyond the propaganda, this is still a hard place to work.  The old stack rank system is gone, but the new system is just as arbitrary and rigid.  As a manager, I often struggled to understand how my employees' final rewards were determined.  There is a revolving door of executives, so strategy changes at least once a year, and often contradicts the previous plan."
good,"The company aspires to transform without losing its identity...shifting business direction and its strategy from software, adding hardware (and sometimes reducing), now onto ML/AI.  All while building a culture of growth mindset and driving for inclusion with a one Microsoft philosophy"
good,"Very fast paced and a very ""boys-club"" kind of culture."
good,The company can at times be unprofessional as far as providing information to it's employees.The short notice of programs closing leaves us unprepared for our next steps.
good,"Typical day involved extensive diary management for both the Sales Director and Marketing Lead. "
good,"Contracting at Microsoft is difficult it is incredibly turbulent.  in 1.5 years I had 5 bosses.  Also, working in the division I was in did not allow for work/life balance."
good,"Great place to learn about dynamic highly competitive industries."
good,"The people that I worked with made the job bearable. If they paid more than they did I would be there right now, but there was no sign of that improving so I had to go."
good,"This is not worth the time to just get ""Microsoft"" on your resume or LinkedIn. Company promotes from within which is great except it based off of you gender and race. A lot of people above you are not as qualified and may lean on you to help them and they are making 20-25% more than you."
good,"Ok place to work, pool tables, ping pong tables, free drinks no free lunch"
good,"-Management needs better communication skills"
good,"As a contractor, depending on the group at Microsoft, it may or may not be the place for you. One would think that people would generally feel like they are on the same team, but in reality it is a very cut-throat, competitive environment. Management doesn't always know how to manage either. I do not recommend this company."
good,"Lively chaos gone Global: free training, free rein on travel, work with some of the best minds. Essentially no budget constraints for program managers. Differs widely between divisions. Innovative management methodology: management requests objectives from the employee but revisions required until approved."
good,While corporate Microsoft is a positive place I do not recommend retail jobs. The pay is below average for sales and i was told by the GM that i was only hired to fill a diversity checkbox.
good,"Working long hours 3 days week from 7:30 am to 6:30 pm using ASP.net Core, C#, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, AWS Cloud, Python, and AWS Lambda Functions and Step Functions."
good,"Microsoft is a large company and you need to make yourself stand out above your colleagues. To move up you'll need a bit of luck, the right relationships and at least one fantastic accomplishment every year."
good,"Working for Microsoft it was fair at times, through all of the heat it was worth it. It was enjoyable not to hectic, but it would be busy at times but if your capable of multitasking their you’ll do fine."
good,"A smart business model with embedded software in billions of PCs ensures Microsoft's growth and survival, very smart people but extremely political and a backstabbing cultural environment. People get paid well. Management doesn't like bad news or numbers so all reports are sugar coated and true issues are hidden, no one wants to look bad and be accountable for mistakes, no matter the level of the screw ups the company will endure, sort of like ""putting the dust under the carpet"". A great career experience. Microsoft has designed break thru technologies but somehow can't manage to scale and launch successfully, trailing behind others, again it's core is in the Enterprise and is very successful in that space. Couldn't be more grateful for the things I learned at MS, the people I met and the opportunities I received, but it's a miserable place to be at, you are there for the paycheck and waiting for the quarterly sledgehammer to come down, either you move up or you move out, but sooner or later everyone goes."
good,"No matter how hard you work, it feels like out of site - out of mind. Do to work demand you feel that you can succeed and you are stuck in a fixed work space."
good,"The company was deceptive which gives Microsoft a bad rep for continuing to do business with the company.  Lay with dogs, you get fleas. The CEO knew."
good,"The company runs at a fast pace, not always able to think strategically.  Management can be very good or very bad.  As a sales organization, they focus primarily on IT, and have a hard time getting outside of that box."
good,"Microsoft has an admirable mission statement and lots of wonderful workplace culture goals an ethical standards. In my experience, there is a large disconnect between these lofty upper-management goals and application.  "
good,It's a workplace.  It was a good job until it wasn't.  Work experience varies widely depending on management.  A place of employment is somewhere you work.
good,"Interesting work.  Really great people to work with in my division.  At first as a contractor, I was interested in joining full-time.  However, over time my manager turned out to be really terrible and turned me off on working there permanently."
good,Commission based I hate that if u can't sale something u don't make anything. The job was good but the sale was tough. I was doing cold calls for the first couple weeks and it was just hard.
good,"no real internal collaboration, only competition among team members.  ""boys club"" environment.  women hit a glass ceiling quickly.  pay and promotions unequal."
good,"As a vendor my time at Microsoft was limited.  I worked with a lot of great people there and it was exciting to work with new technologies.  I had one great manager that was a pleasure to work for.  That was also followed by a very poor manager that made daily work overly stressful and took any enjoyment out of work."
good,"if you are lucky to be part of a good team then you get to learn a lot. Its a great place for someone fresh out of college. However, there's a lot of politics and managers use engineers just like chess pawns in their games. Mid tier managers just think about their own careers and not about the company."
good,"Good for a beginner to get the exposure, but radically will have to make a shift if you're looking for a stable career. It has been good, but totally depends on the team you're supporting."
good,"Microsoft has trouble getting out of its own way.  Personal politics play a too important role in this company.  The management is afraid of making a wrong decision so they don't make them until its too late and then the employees are the ones who suffer, not management."
good,"Working through consulting firm - nobody cares about personal growth, no matter how much one has achieved doing the job."
good,As a Badging officer at Microsoft I was given additional tasks and duties of an Account Manager and with the rate I was given with only 40 hours a week wasn't worth it. I find it impossible if one was given badging duties for an entire division while being given account management duties with just eight hours in a day. If I were being compensated with a higher rate on salary I would've given a better opinion.
good,"Fun environment because you get to play video games all day, you learn a lot but will not get anywhere with it. You are promised many things here and nothing ever happens for anyone. Good benefits, no raises. Everyone gets a 2% raise at their one year. No work/life balance. Too much work, not enough pay."
good,"Great to get experience, nice atmosphere, very poor management. Very bad work/life balance and very few progression possibilities in the training team."
good,"Management could have been stronger, Communication occurs through out the team but retaining the information being shared was the issue. Constant updates and changes in protocol were made daily with very little training. Therefore errors and uncertainty are common."
good,"A place to learn and follow new processes. People are helpful and coordinating. Hardest part of job is working into skillsets which are not of interest and providing deliverables before deadline which consolidates to stress and stretch disturbing life balance."
good,"The company is going through an inflection point trying to move away from boxed product to cloud services. There are many factions trying to figure this out inside the company. And these factions don't always agree on direction or overarching principles. So for the next 3 or 4 years, the company will be going through significant chop trying to figure this all out."
good,"was a fast paced job "
good,Rat race all over the place. There is whole lot of empire building in different teams. Microsoft waste lots of money and time in ego-centric development process.
good,"Getting my feet wet as a hardware/software tester, this was a great place to start having no previous experience. The work wasn't the best, and due to the nature of it, the hours were very up and down. I got my feet wet here and learned alot about the games industry which pushed me to branch out into different areas/companies in search of the best fit for me."
good,"Work on tasks or open project. "
good,"Research and Develop ideas that work."
good,"As a technical program manager, my role was to break down requirements into features and spec them out. Working together with Dev/test on design and driving the project to completion. Collaborating heavily with partner teams to meet the project goals, unblocking dev/test, providing visibility to upper management through presentations, demos, ship room status, emails. Forward planning for next release and external partner interactions."
good,"Worked closely with developers and program managers to review design specs for all improvements. Created corresponding test specs, and designed and wrote new tests in C, C++ and C# while maintaining old tests to ensure backward compatibility. Participated in code reviews in all stages of product and test code generation. "
good,"Too many cooks in the kitchen, conflicting egos all the time"
good,"As a 10 year employee, I can't agree more with the write up recently posted on Vanity Fair (Search ""vanity+fair lost+decade""). This company eats its own and spits out mediocrity."
good,"Days would often be spent dilly dallying and not getting anything of substance done. A lot of time was spend running in circles with poor management with no vision and no one really driving it. They pay top dollar and stuck around for that, but it didn't get me to stay. The culture is very politically influenced, and if you don't go along with the political winds you don't go along with the company."
good,"Work differs much depending on your organization."
good,"Need to be better organized."
good,"Microsoft, was just a job to do there was no appreciation for staff no matter how hard you work.Even if you work above your job level or title.Although getting an promotion your opinions wasn't taken seriously."
good,Work culture is very specific to teams. Some teams are more flexible than others. Some teams do challenging and cool work but not all. Has good resources as a company.
good,"Microsoft is under a good leader which believes in people; however there are some managers that do not practice what the leader promotes. Very sad!"
good,"Daily System Support and development opportunities"
good,"current role micro managed, manager prefers work over life. "
good,"Working at Microsoft can be fun. There are opportunities to network and work with people across the globe. But the training and knowledge needed to execute the job effectively are limited. Managers don't realize that employees need to train and learn the products that employees are working with. "
good,I was with Microsoft IT.  Most of the applications are 20 years old with no substantial investment in updating them. Most of the time went in bug fixing or resurrecting servers than in actual development.
good,Playing catch up with peers and starting to show some innovation. Azure is a pain to manage and run. O365 is still the cash cow. Companies within a company.
good,"You work hard, you play hard, the pay is good, but there is no loyalty from anyone above or with HR. I wish there was an easier way to move from team to team. I think this is the biggest issue currently, poor middle management with no idea where the company is going."
good,"Go beyond the limits of your on-premises datacenter using the scalable, reliable infrastructure that powers the Microsoft Cloud. Transform your business and reduce maintenance costs with an energy-efficient infrastructure spanning more than 100 highly secure facilities worldwide, linked by one of the largest networks on ...review Microsoft Cloud Data Center.. is the best place to work."
good,"The part of Microsoft I was working with was very disorganized. Managment was incredibly overworked and hard to get in contact with, but the team culture was pretty nice."
good,"Job satisfaction will be based on your manager.  Some good, some bad.   A lot of FTEs in role who hand over their entire job to contractors who don't get MSFT benefits but it makes you wonder what their job is and what they're getting paid for. Especially when you begin your work day before them, and continue to work after they log off for the day."
good,"Solid benefits/salary are a given at Microsoft. Your role, quality of your manager, and team collaboration can be very hit or miss. In my case, they were a miss."
good,"It is retail, what can I say?  As a top performer and sales lead, there are college kids that are compensated at a higher pay rate than myself. How is this even possible? Retail associates are treated as if they are bottom level associates.  I like the company overall and appreciate the time that I have been employed, but I am too skilled for a retail environment and feel like I am wasting my time in a Microsoft retail store."
good,"As a contractor, I can only give my review based on what I experienced."
good,"There are a lot of perks and some really good people."
good,"The company changed a lot in the 20 years I worked there. lower management is horrendous. The hyper competitive atmosphere creates a self preservation mentality. The worse by far was the SQL team - most of us senior people felt like we had a target on there back. Management seemed to value college hires that will do anything for their next promotion, over experienced engineers who do most of the quality work but probably have plateaued career-wise (I fell into this bucket if I am honest). Ethos of ""don't care how you do it as long as you deliver."" So lots of short term engineering and then move on before the ""bad stuff"" hits the fan. I couldn't take it any more. It was making me sick. I'd rather have been paid less for a little less stress, but it's almost impossible to take a step backwards."
good,"You need to be selective and make sure you are working for a compatible team. I worked for several teams, only a couple of them were compatible."
good,"This is a big company to work for and it is trying at times like any job I am sure but I will say I feel as though a lot of the issues here are lack of communication and you are not allowed to help each other which this was a first  for me. I love the people I work with and I love interacting with our business reps from all over the country. I participate on conference calls daily, I make schedules for shipments coming in, I do invoicing, keep track of our inventory, set goals for the week, give our GM or VP helpful ways to save or cut back on time management or various other business."
good,"Management was rude, Didn't offer any help or training. Gave you a bunch of manuals to read through and expected you to know exactly what you were doing. If you made a mistake, you would get lectured by manager rather than taught the correct way to do it. Constantly was looked down on and talked down to."
good,"Teleperformance supplies a great educational package, and great training. A very oppressive place to work for employees."
good,Not great like what you think it would be or could be. Management is very poor and the employee rating system is really screwed up.
good,"No dia em que fui contratada, inciei trabalhos de auditoria, para obter  melhorias nos trabalhos na área de operações, onde havia muito prejuízo devido aos erros dos operadores de telefone na área de denuncias de softwares irregulares."
good,"Trabalho dinâmico e com foco em resultados."
good,A great place to work if 65+ hours per week are what you are willing to provide.  The benefits help outweigh the impact to work life balance.
good,Managed all business transactions processed through the store. Managed largest account with repeat purchases.  High expectations were set with no compensation for results shown.
good,"I've worked for this current store for over a year. The store manager knows nothing about managing and keeping employees happy. One assistant manager knows nothing about managing, yet somehow they obtained a very nice paying job and plenty of job security as it is impossible to be fired from Microsoft."
good,Answering calls from customer that have issues with there device such as Xbox and or Windows products. Tech support / billing and explaining subscriptions along with creating repair orders for Microsoft products.
good,"Hours are long and inconsistent, No weekends or holidays off, position is interesting and ever changing, Management team is very scattered and disorganized, and not overly interested in work/life balance"
good,"Lions and Tigers and Bears OH MY. I learned a lot while I was there - but everything I learned was not good. The egos and narrow-mindedness are hard to stomach, and honesty is far from the best policy if you want to advance. Your co-workers might or might not be your friends - you won't know until you move on. The company is disingenuous when it claims to be people oriented, whether you are a customer or employee."
good,"Good "
good,I have had many wonderful experiences at Microsoft with so many talented people.
good,"o	Performed problem-solving and efficient troubleshooting skills in Microsoft Office and Outlook (All versions of Microsoft Office installation send/receive issue in outlook, outlook express and windows mail, update and upgrade office system etc.)"
good,"Microsoft can be a tough place for advancement since they have adopted the ""stack ranking"" model for raise and bonus. There are many positions in various disciplines."
good,"highly political, alot of churn. Work is not recognized"
good,"Used to be a great place to work. Until they change their compensation and review model to be more balanced it will be a toxic place to work. Microsoft's review and compensation policies have always been brutal, but now it's preditory. Most of the discretion on reviews has been removed by a forced distribution system that is more hostile than based on actual merit. The company mostly has high performing teams and individuals. A model like this for people with this personality type is not complimentative. As a result, a team of high performers will have people that will not be rewarded for their accomplishments but in some cases actually be punished to the point of termination."
good,Concentrarme en la empresa y dar resultados laborales
good,"I was there while stack ranking was still the standard review process.  This created a lot of back stabbing in the company to get ahead.  I understand that the review process has since changed away from stack ranking however, it will probably take many years to actually change the culture."
good,"I prefer a work place that rewards me for getting the job done, not one that only wants you to be placed in a role and never diverge into a more influential and helpful asset to the company."
good,Es ist wichtig sich genau zu informieren worauf man sich einlässt.
good,"抱著滿腔熱血的心進到這間公司"
good,"Unless you are a blue badge, (FTE) you are not open to the opportunities others enjoy. The recruiting agency/talent pool was not beneficial to me since I desired full-time work."
good,"Microsoft troubleshooting was difficult. "
good,"Fantastic work environment, very relaxed, smart people, but, unfortunately not particularly inclusive. Many people believe they have the only right answers."
good,The best thing in Microsoft is the benefits. The pay wasn't adequate for basic living necessities. Advancement is extremely difficult. Management was horrible and extremely biased. The company is one giant propaganda machine for the liberal-left.
good,"During my time at Microsoft even as a vendor I was exposed to challenges are learning. Being on the cutting edge, working with environments and products that are globally recognized was both a joy and instilled high standards as a guardian of production."
good,"Enjoy the experience of working within Microsoft environs, as a volunteer with flexibility.  Not sure about working as an employee how flexible and real the company is to staff.  Would like to find out sometime."
good,"Компания в России сильно изменилась за последние 5 лет. Майкрософт не набирает сотрудников в штат, по контракту условия очень не выгодные. Очень много хороших специалистов покинули компанию. ТСала тяжелая психологическая атмосфера"
good,"we got comp time for after hours work"
good,Very high paced and stressful due to impacts to customer with potential IT and facility outages. Culture is one of accountability and ambiguous expectations.
good,"A typical day at work involves helping customers with various issues with their computers, teaching customers how to use our technology, helping customers adopt our technology through sales and service, and working in the back of house to facilitate repairs and updates."
good,"Immediate management falsified and made up reviews and invented negative events that never happened.  Prejudged negatively and never was given a full time account work load since day 1 even though customer base was extremely satisfied with my customer service.  Be advised, you have no remedies as HR and/or the chain-of-command will act like they care, but in the end nothing will be done leaving you with the option of being fired or leaving on your own terms.  Great company and benefits, but lousy, incompetent immediate management."
good,"Had to wait days to get set up with the security to get to my desk/office.  Contractors treated poorly.  Unable to come and go as needed after hours or weekends or work remotely because of being a contractor.  Computer was locked up after hours at office."
good,"In this Job, I found that the work environment was beyond friendly and the team that I was working in was a well-organised unit which allowed us to operate together. However, this role paid minimum wage and didn't have any other benefits other than free drinks from the staff fridge. It was also a zero-hours contract that had me a couple of days before they wanted me, and I ended up working as few as two days a month."
good,"Microsoft is a great company overall. The company needs to focus hiring right person in management especially. HR needs to step up their plate in determine and helping management to improve their quality of evaluating the right person based on education, experience and knowledge about the role."
good,Like most places it seems good from the outside but very disparate in treating everyone the same.  Diversity is thought as well as the typical items and Microsoft cannot separate the two.
good,"The work at MSFT is nearly always with current technology and interesting.  One downside is that MSFT does not use software that wasn't produced at and by the company - so when you leave, you don't have experiences that translate well to other companies."
good,It is still the same Microsoft. Benefits are still better than other companies.Work / life balance at Microsoft is a myth. You are just a cog in the wheel. If a cheaper cog is available you are gone in a heartbeat.
good,"Microsoft offers some amazing benefits and advancement for opportunity - IF you know the right people. Unfortunately, my store had a racial, colorism issue, and you were unable to grow or move up in the store or farther, if you were black. Mostly everyone who worked there knew management from their previous roles at a close Best Buy location, and they were all promoted and have moved on to different locations and cities. None of the people of color got those same opportunities."
good,Everything depends on what team you have. I was fortunate to get a amazing team and people but work environment in Microsoft can be hostile. Especially with many people with long tenure.
good,"Poor management, extensive politics.  If one person on your team doesn't like you, you are blackballed.  Almost impossible to navigate the matrix of players on your team."
good,"Alorica who handles Microsoft's Bing Ads Services and Support accounts, is a company that need more help than I am willing to tolerate. No concern for the worker who is treated like a disposable tool."
good,"Interaction with other members of the team was hard to accomplish. "
good,"stressful, cutthroat environment,  Not team oriented and did collaborate honestly, no trust, teams didn't support teams,  poor leadership at the team level.  execs appointed team leaders and did get involved"
good,"Your MSFT experience depends on the group you work with. Mine was dysfunctional, under staffed, and lacked management/direction. Staying there would have slowed my career down due to the lack of value it was adding so I left."
good,"Generally good place to work with smart people and master new technologies. The multiple divisions within the company offer chances to increase exposure to different products and engineering expertise.  Competitive wages, but perks fall short compared to other tech companies."
good,CEO is implementing a positive change in approach to dealing with 3rd parties and other platforms but company is taking vocal effort to hire only minorities and folks out of college while at the same time stating importance of diversity - which is impossible when you look to eliminate groups completely from the hiring decisions.
good,Skype is a fast paced team and I had an opportunity to work with new features for Skype across multiple devices. Was a good experience working with the devs and the team.
good,"The WIM's (Windows Informational Meetings) were parties that tended to be too loud and made it hard to concentrate on getting work done."
good,"I returned to Microsoft after being gone for several years and it was a completely different company and environment post-Steve Balmer. The energy is palpable and seems to be a new buzz about development. However what is felt in the engineering and other business groups, is severely lacking within the Talent Acquisition organization. They are years behind and seem to still be stuck in the highly politicized arena and the lack of progress and ""out of the box"" thinking is almost non-existent. They have over-engineered the process in many ways, and their idea of ""revolutionary"" recruiting practices are simply things that great recruiters have already been doing for years. It's nothing new, it's lackluster at best and extremely frustrating. It's still a ""good old boy"" environment and the lack of true diversity in leadership is blatantly obvious."
good,"Several instances of inappropriate and offensive humor. "
good,"You will work extremely hard based on the verbal promises of ""taking you to the next level"". In reality, they want you to exhaust your skills set at the same pay, lead others on how to do better but not promote you. Your ""big chance"" never comes, no matter how many stellar annual reviews and conversations you have with management."
good,No hay horario establecido de trabajo por lo que manejar tu tiempo es un beneficio y también una obligación. El ambiente es altamente competitivo y muy exigente. Lo mas difícil es manejar las expectativas para llegar a las metas.
good,"Microsoft is a whole lot more disorganized than I was expecting.  Also there is very little training (if you think that you're going to learn all of the secret stuff that no one else knows... probably not)."
good,"As a vendor employee I found that working within Microsoft can be stressful, and if you are in a support role to another group you are not appreciated at all."
good,"Like most contract jobs at Microsoft, it depends on your team."
good,"Microsoft is a great place to work, in terms of pay and benefits. Generally, the people you work with are easy to get along with. Management, however, doesn't have anything better to do than sit around and constantly change already working protocols and procedures."
good,management are not compassionate.  Management will overwork you with realistic expectations.  The only positive aspect about working for Microsoft/compass was access to Microsoft perks and food
good,"Microsoft is a great company if you can make it out of retail. While senior leadership preaches One Microsoft, the reality is that there is no advancement out of retail, even for the most qualified and passionate associates."
good,"You will meet amazing and smart people - and will be able to develop under the right leadership.  Unfortunately, there are still Inadequate middle level managers who aren't prepared to lead a team effectively and resort to bullying."
good,"Primary benefits included superior pay, healthcare, good training on products."
good,"Long hours"
good,we started out pulling cable..From cat5 to cat6..ASSEMBLED THE RACKS That the cable treys went in..Over all i enjoyed my work..Furcated fibers as well
good,"I have enjoyed working at MS and have done well in my career at this company."
good,"You learn a lot in their fast pace environment, but you do not have time for your life. In MS everything you  can think of and do is related to them, not even being sick is an option."
good,"The high you get once you have executed your project to Go Live and the customer is super excited.  You look at your team and you say, now all the long hours and hard work has really paid off.  And your team and the customers team go out afterwards and celebrate.  This is one of my favorite parts of my job."
good,"I was a contractor, pay was acceptable 1 year limit on contract jobs.  Hours and workload where reasonable.  Traffic during prime times was horrible with huge backups on 101 off ramp."
good,"Microsoft is a great company, full of very talented people but it has grown very political and complicated. I think they have a chance to be relevant in the Smartphone arena but it requires a lot of innovation as opposed to trying to work based on the past."
good,"This job requires extreme attention to detail. The PTO is generous, however one false move and you're done. For IT this job doesn't pay all that much. The initial salary is about 40k a year, however it is extremely low, if you have a degree in Administration."
good,"A work with United nations High commissioner for refugees,"
good,"I had been working for Microsoft as a contractor for the past 9 years, as I can tell, contractor are treated like 2nd class citizen. Full time employee are treated pretty good, but pretty much all of them worked over 50 hours per week without any extra pay."
good,"I have been at MSFT since 2007, as an FTE and then as a contractor. This place does not care about you. The salary and benefits are good, but it can just be brutal."
good,"My typical day is spent creating multiple tactical plans that help support product adoption. I've learned a great deal about how to manage various marketing projects with limited tools and resources, while sharpening my time management skills. The employees across Microsoft are very smart and are part of a culture that is focused on driving product metrics."
good,"Good salary great technology, bad management, "
good,My hours are from 6am to 2:30pm. I work inside of an office to where I set up work for the employees outside. I respond to all emails sent from customers and Microsoft. I learn something new using the PKMS almost every week.  I would give management here 5 out of 10. My co-workers are some of the coolest people I know. The hardest part of my job is taking the blame for some one else's mistakes. The most enjoyable part is not having to be micro managed.
good,I did an internship for a period of one month in Adecco understanding the end to end process from a Recruitment consultancy point of view.
good,"If you get in the right department, there are many opportunities for advancement and networking."
good,Had a very good experience working with a very supportive team. Our boss was a very considerate person and managed our team very efficiently.
good,Learned great skills and information; Politics and favoritism.  Stack ranking still semi exists; Need to place better leaders in leadership and management roles
good,"Working for Microsoft was a challenge. We never had the proper tools to do the job. They would not provide us with the software they wanted us to support. We had to burn illegal copies ( Microsoft gave us the ok) yourself. Location was also an issue, cubicle farm as we called it."
good,A company who is passionate about helping others achieve goals.
good,Shift work. Coworkers are easy going. There is always work to get done in an 12-hour shift.
good,There are times a interesting problem will come up and solving it provides good value to company and personal satisfaction. Yet these opportunities seems rare and far between.
good,"Great people to work for, though the company has very little loyalty to its people"
good,"Microsoft used to be an amazing place to work and still has some really great aspects, however it has become a big, bloated corporate engine where if you aren't political or willing to play games it's very difficult to advance your career or make a difference. Doing a great job isn't enough anymore to move forward in the company. I've been here over 10 years and had 10 different bosses in that time, most of which were terrible managers but often great individual contributors. The company has also gotten into a reactive mode of operating and much of the executive management live in ivory towers and do not understand the competition or what people want, they build products thinking that people should just love them because we built them."
good,Good place to work if you are looking to park. This place needs new leadership.
good,Company is too good. Some LT's and MT's screw up the whole system. Lots of favourism. No team work. Work is routine and mundane if they don't give you opportunities to work on new projects.
good,Microsoft is a good company.
good,"Microsoft is a challenging and rewarding place to work. The company's compensation and benefits are good and ample learning and growth opportunities are available. The quality of management is sheerly dependent upon the group, the hardest part of the job is navigating and influencing change in such a large organization, and the most enjoyable part of the job is the company's general willingness to allow its employees to work from outside of the office."
good,Microsoft promotes the hiring of college students.  The older (50 +) tend to get pushed out to make room for the newcomers.  Your manager has the power to make or break you regardless of how good of a job you do.  Very politically driven company.  If you don' t play the game well you will not survive.  Disappointing to say the least.
good,"I believe with in Microsoft Corporation there are better places to work than Fargo campus.  It is Feudalism culture. Too many younger son/daughters  of older employees working there. ( I am early 30's btw). Local managers has not clue to be a leadership. They are quite ""poor"". To much cover up. If the managers make a ""not funny joke"" you have to LOL, otherwise you are not part of team. I believe inside sales has built a ""not reversible"" culture for NOT to appreciate you as hard work and positive attitude. They want more, They want you to kiss ""theirs rings"". My co-workers are very good to be around. "
good,Microsoft has lots of growth and opportunity to try new roles. The workplace can be fast-paced but also rewarding at the same time. working for Microsoft means meeting a great group of people and learning all kinds of new things.
good,"MS is a large company, depending on where you work and for which team would make a difference on the way you feel about the company.  The company has a good work life balance overall."
good,Man är ganska ensam på services när man jobbar. Flexibiliteten på arbetstider är bra.
good,"-Too much middle management. "
good,"Your direct manager is the main person that assesses your performance which determines merit increases, bonus and stock compensation.  If you have a manager that appreciates what you do and then you will likely do well; otherwise, it can be disappointing and difficult.  I've had both awesome and horrible managers over my 20 years there.  Unfortunately, the horrible managers tend leave permanent scars."
good,"You report to a manager in the US, who has no idea about daily happenings in the office. Taking advantage of this, the older employees act like managers."
good,"Produce aluminium part for various industry and a good place to gain experiance in manufacturing industry."
good,"Management says they are willing to change but do not and push team player out instead of working with them.  The new CEO is much better, but needs to get the culture changed down to the janitor."
good,Trong công việc mọi người rất nhiệt tình giúp đỡ nhưng chế độ cho nv chưa dk tốt
good,"Great CEO, good business strategy, bad middle level leaders: Microsoft business strategy is gaining traction led by a very smart, humble and respectful CEO. However, there are still bad middle level leaders/managers that are not aligned to new culture, growth mindset. As a consequence, good talent continue to leave the company."
good,Working with a team to sell microsoft product and build loyalty to the brand. Could have been a good environment but the management was not effective at the location i was employed.
good,"Can be a good place to work if you can navigate the highly political culture.  Everything hinges on your immediate manager, skip level manager and VP to be successful here.  You can work on many cool technologies, however the management leadership politics can suck the air out of you."
good,"The politics and processes will likely drive you insane if, like me, you are a ""just get the job done"" worker.  Showboating is the only way to get ahead there.  That's just not me."
good,"Working for Microsoft is a blessing, you're exposed to diverse views and are always surrounded with new technology. The benefits are the best of any company I've worked for and people tend to stay for them. That said, there is much to be desired in terms of leadership. HR is a serious issue and turnover is high at lower positions."
good,"Microsoft treats their employees well. they pay very well. My only complaint with them is a lack of focus on quality control. Also, the lack the type of creative initiative that I enjoy working with."
good,"Satya has brought in some leadership principles to try and make Microsoft a more collaborative, agile organization - but change is slow and in pockets."
good,Very diverse experience depending on where you work within the company.  Constant change - reorganizations and layoffs permeate the culture and sometimes reduce the experience to self preservation.
good,Microsoft offers a good package but a hard working environment. The matrix organization is full of conflicts of objectives and interpersonal stress. So while well compensated surviving in the organization is very stressful.
good,"Microsoft is a great company, however, the Retail Stores are not a good place to work at.  Leadership is weak, unprofessional and career advancement is poor."
good,"productive and fun work place"
good,The cultural change initiated by CEO is an excellent one. However it still dominated by old timer with turf battles. Lot of incompetent folks are still around and willing to stay foot at any cost.
good,MSFT is a good pay master. However it is very competitive. This can take toll on work life balance. You may end up being dissatisfied. It also depends on the business and role you work in.
good,"Overall, I would be able to tell the people who asked me ""How do I like Microsoft?"" and I would say that I loved it. I hated the management at the Retail level though. Something that I would have to tell a lot of employees wanting to start there is that you will not be able to advance in the big stores. Only the small ones will you be recognized for all the hard work that you do. It was all politics in my store and definitely some unfair decisions took place when it came to the people who was favored over the people who actually put in time and effort to make all experiences for customers worth it while bringing in money over a manager who would scream at the top of his lungs across the store making everyone think he was ""special"" or customers uncomfortable. The benefits were amazing. The company was giving. But I ultimately decided to leave because from what I was getting paid compared to how much I was making, it was disappointing."
good,"The culture at Microsoft is so bad that everyone tries talk bad about peers, back stabbing is prevalent, management have no experience to manage and they still thinks its 30 years ago at workplace."
good,"Probably shouldn't rely on my review. I did not have a positive experience working int the Advertising and Online division.  Tools sucked, onboarding and training sucked and the whole division was a loser for MSFT."
good,"Typically, work will begin at 6:00 am, and run until midnight, mostly in meetings with world-wide partners. All Engineering work is done in India, and Project Management being done in Redmond, so the disconnect is pretty wide."
good,"Most of the roles on the Microsoft account at Randstad Sourceright allow for full time work from home after 6 months in office in Renton, WA.  The work life balance however is not ideal.  They have a no overtime policy but all the roles require you to work over to complete the base job.  I've seen high turnover for this alone.  Most of my coworkers have admitted to working for free."
good,"Microsoft allowed me the flexibility to learn many new things. SQL, automation, C# programming, database management, setup of machines, setup of builds to be tested. "
good,You are constantly reminded that you are not a Microsoft employee.  You are definitely treated like a second class citizen even though you are doing a tremendous amount of work
good,"Stay outside of few orgs like CSS and MSIT and there is some good roles. Bad managers who are non-technical suck. Be prepared to deal with incompetent TAMs, PFE and then some seriously smart people."
good,"Microsoft is a very heterogeneous organization. Some teams are great, some are not. It depends very much in which group you work. In general, Microsoft is still very Microsoft centric vs. customer-centric. There are a lot of ""talkers"" vs. ""doers"". Politics is still very present and it trumps results."
good,"It is a good company to work with, however your manager or skip manager has all power in your annual review, bonus and career advancement. CEO is driving a better company culture but it is still quite different by departments."
good,"I currently work as a contractor for Microsoft and have for roughly 9 years. Although the vendor model has changed over the years I have worked, I still value the ability to move around more freely than I would have had I been hired as an employee."
good,"The new CEO has made strides to improve the company and execute competitive advantage across the board.  Employee development has improved over the years, but has some ways to go."
good,"Työympäristö ja työtoverit Suomessa eivät muuttuneet, olivat erinomaiset, mutta yhteistyö pääkonttorin ja kolleegojen kanssa U.S.A.ssa oli haasteellista"
good,"Microsoft pays well and has excellent benefits.  The culture is toxic and cut throat, with virtually no collaboration.  There is also a forced distribution that a mandatory 5% of all employees have to receive an ""Underperformed"" performance rating, even of they are a top performer.  It's all political.  It's not what you know, it's who you know."
good,"I started out with a manager that I loved. I ended up with one who couldn't give ice away to a dying man in the desert. Poor leader, poor sales manager."
good,"As a resource company, one should remember that the person who's working for you is also a client.  There were times when the recruiter did not reach out."
good,"Dealt with a lot of content and marketing promotions.  "
good,Managers let too much go on unchecked and are too disconnected from the actual work being performed.Opportunities for advancement are only given to friends of the management team and are not earned.
good,The culture at Microsoft is very much a product of how Microsoft operates as a business. Much like products are quickly launched and discarded and there is no real long term career development opportunity as you burn the candle at both ends until they can replace you through a reorg or a stealth layoff.
good,all teams have different priorities and the orgs never align so that you basically all have a gun to one another like it's a hostage situation and you have to get your demands met without caving to agreeing to do anythign for anyone else ebcause that slows down your team's other priorities.  This is the antithesis of agile.  Give your crews a chance to be innovative by ensuring that org goals have resourcing alignment.
good,"Really hard and fast paced, suffered with the worst manager of my career, left because of him and not Microsoft.  Workplace culture is still evolving but headed in the right direction.  Hardest part of the job was the lack of resources however the best part was the interaction and developing of products between clients and engineering"
good,"Working at Microsoft does not allow a good work-life balance. Stretched work hours for most part of the year."
good,Microsoft is a big machine - there is good and bad.  If you have a bad manager look to change as quickly as possible.  Some very positive changes are happening at the company right now.
good,Oportunidade ótima para conhecimentos e experiências profissionais.
good,I enjoyed my first 8 years at Microsoft.  It was aggressive and the resources were amazing.  The culture changed when my organization moved and it took away responsibility.
good,this job just didn't met the needs of young mother not knowing the day or time your hours would change or be affected by your home. Everyday their would be a new rule at work or how to work
good,"Gran empresa pero muy mal ambiente laboral, HR no ayudaba precisamente"
good,"Very hard to move up in this company. Managers have their favourites and they are the ones that seem to rise. "
good,"If you can get a job as an FTE, that's probably fine. But they treat contractors like dirt. 10 of us crammed in an office and I was let go without any notice or opportunity to improve my performance."
good,"Nice co-workers, but they didn't get too close as you might not be there next year."
good,I am handling a team of 6 people. Hardest part of the job is when we don't get customers. Enjoyable part is when we get customers to sell the product.
good,"Lots of promises they never delivered on. It was and will always be about getting your money. Heartless with letting employees go and Management or Executives always use the smaller employees as scapegoats. Store quality of products keeps deteriorating, thus lots of returns. Hard pressure on sales staff and even more pressure on Tech room associates. Employee policies and rules always change day to day depending on the Manager overseeing, no consistent direction. If you stand outside and look in you can see how ""happy"" most staff are. Very seldom are non sales employees given credit for their work. Above minimum wage, great benefits, but not worth stress or job insecurity. Lots of swag, gifts, and free food."
good,"The benefits and salary are only advantage, no scope of growth. It is not suitable for someone who is looking to grow in career. It is more suitable for someone who is just looking for a steady income month on month basis."
good,Don't feel comfortable answering this here.  I don't know where the data will be sent to.  Please ask me in person if you would like to have this information.
good,"it's dog eat dog, and no clear message from the top when it comes to policy or job security.  Since the Vendor policy has been implemented, no one is comfortable there, even FTE's  No consistency or dedication to it's employees.  Either FTE or Vendor. and very few African Americans are employed by Microsoft"
good,"My most enjoyable part of my job is, I've been excited to learn something each day. "
good,"Great challenges and smart, thoughtful people."
good,"Required 6 months of on the job training. "
good,"Microsoft delivers great pay, and awesome benefits; however, needs to get better at collaboration and teamwork.  The hardest part of the job is working outside of your own team.  The single exception to this - and bright spot of Microsoft as a whole - is Skype.  This team has a completely different culture, and one founded on great collaboration between the teams."
good,"Ổn nhưng khó thăng tiến trong công việc"
good,"good to work not much work pressure, lot things to learn."
good,"The company is all about Windows for PCs and now is putting a big bet on cloud. All other areas and business are lacking direction and are targets for the constant layoffs."
good,"I have learned Change Management at Micrsoft, going from a Leading Devices Company (Nokia) with more than 90% market share to a struggling Company in Devices around 2% market share. Change in terms of Customers and Channel management, Working with limited budgets, raise our fighting spirit and most importantly, ability to adapt to a totally new culture."
good,"Have learnt a lot of the folks at Microsoft. Great place to work."
good,"Did not learn much as immediate senior knew almost nothing. "
good,"Everyone in the group is talented and for the most part the work is rewarding.  This team is excellent at firefighting and day-to-day operations because that is what they know how to do and they are praised for quick reaction.  What the team lacks is the discipline of execution, setting and achieving improvement goals."
good,"A typical day at my workplace would be smooth running of banking operations and greeting customers and coordinating with staff at the branch."
good,"Most of the jobs and work at Microsoft are very rewarding with great people to learn from and opportunities for advancement."
good,"Fantastic benefits, Amazing Channel vice president. HR on retail side needs improvement. Not a lot of communication and things get missed when hiring new personal."
good,Fun place to work but hard to stay on the same page as management.
good,There are great resources for research and development.  Layoffs have really put a damper on things.  Benefits are still better than most places but they are slowly becoming like other companies.  The yearly review process still sucks.
good,"Highly political...success is dependent on your manager"
good,"I love the people, company, and products. The most fun I have ever had at any job. However, I need a career with growth. Both professional and personal."
good,Lots of process work and cross-group collaboration.  I don't feel like I get too much accomplished.  Good work life balance.
good,"wonderful company to work for... dynamic, fast paced and challenging."
good,Helped customers with there there problems about there consloes and accessories when they were unable to locate them. Created orders for them to ship out ther items. I also keep them informed what was going on with there item.
good,Good working environment and challenging work but tight deadlines and ultimate pressure at work.
good,"Roles and Responsibilities"
good,"Lecture des mails et organisation de la journée par rapport a l urgence de chaque requête. "
good,"The good:"
good,"Very focused on Licensing sales, less and less value creation, very short-term minded management"
good,"Forget about job security since it's contract work. Pay is minimal for the work you do. No appreciation, again, because its contract work."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is two fold."
good,"If you want to grow at Microsoft, you will have to be ready to burn yourself."
good,"Great career opportunities, benefits and making you feel valued as an employee. You can easily get worked over, but it's up to you to maintain the ""life"" aspect and hold strong to it. Like any big company, there are many levels of politics, frequent reorganizations and any employee will tell you about the stress of annual performance reviews."
good,It's would be better if you are an FTE here instead to be a vendor. That's the reason why I am trying to find a FTE job nearby.
good,"A typical day consisted of meetings through out the morning, visiting locations to train through out the afternoon, and then arriving at home to do reports through out the evening."
good,I worked at Microsoft for 14.5 years.  They used to be a great company that valued their employees.  Now the only thing that maters in Premier support is upselling contracts and what numbers fit on your managers spread sheet so it can be rolled up to their managers manager.  Ballmer hired the walmart mentality for their COO and put IBM spread sheet driven execs in middle management.
good,"- had to deal with AMS which is the company Microsoft outsource lots of it HR to. People not responsive, barely supportive and a different status within Microsoft which means no benefits"
good,Microsoft is a very dynamic place to work with extremely talented people.
good,Do not care to complete this
good,"First 2 years were fun, but as the organization grew, specialization and mission creep grew. Success there depends upon whether you have a good manager or not."
good,"Great place to work while you're young, competitive, and ambitious. You will either make it or not and if you make it, you'll be well compensated. Plan to work long hours with talented people."
good,Microsoft has great benefits and compensation but the work culture is becoming progressively worse.
good,A team player who knows how get along with co workers respectfully. Knows how get the job done in timely manners. Believes in solving problems and helping others.
good,"Review process emphasizes ""what did you deliver and how much money did you save the company"" to which has led to a everyone-for-themselves culture. Additionally, if you are not a software engineer within a major product (e.g. Azure services, O365, Server) you are likely going to have management consist of persons who started in the early 1990's and are looking to ride our their position until they can retire. Leads to team complacency, lack of value and regular re-organizations."
good,"Peple I directly worked with, were very intelligent, responsive. They respected me and each other. The job was interesting, utilized my knowlege in various areas. The higher management seems does not think about company interests. When a budget was reduced they laid off most experienced people first."
good,"Would rather not as the work life balance was not their and Manager was in another city and would not visit site but once every 6 months."
good,"Nothing much to say it was a good learning experience from my end I have learned a lot new things over there like management of stock ,sales etc.Over there i got to know about the hardcore sales of a premium series product."
good,Salary is very poor in Microsoft services. It is not as per the industry standards. Hikes are hopeless. Other departments look down upon the services which is the worst part of working in Microsoft services. Frequent change in the management is undesirable.
good,I love Microsoft but I was essentially being categorized for being a military veteran for my decisions as a manager which was not correct. To this day I still believe in the vital function Microsoft provides. I am not Ok with being stereotyped as follow orders automaton so I ventured out into the actual world of software and they really need my skills. I cannot see a world without Microsoft but I can clearly see me in a world without Microsoft. I have sold and implemented a ton of AWS work in the last few years so perhaps I have a different calling. Take the opportunity in front of you not the one you want in front of you. Right??
good,"The churn from reorganizations makes team and relational cohesiveness elusive, sapping the synergies of orgs and individuals.  It's like building a house and constantly having all the subs suddenly change multiple times.  The ""new team"" now has to figure out what was done, where the pipes and wires were laid, and frequently either busts into the walls to redo what was already done, or suddenly finds a short circuit due to mistakingly cutting into an wire or pipe, or has vermin infesting the structure because holes were left gaping because the person who was formerly working on structure was moved to a new job. Moreover, I have frequently observed that annual mandated quotas of 5-10% ""poor performance"" rating system forces out amazing colleagues, not because of poor performance, but due to meeting arbitrary quotas.  Ironically, the horrible impact to the churn mentioned above, plus the stress on staff, far exceed any theoretical benefit of ""culling the poor performers.""  (Yes, there are sometimes bonafide poor performers, but 5-10% a year? What changed?  MS hired them believing they were great.  So did really 5-10% suddenly become bad performers each year, or is there something endemic with the organization that could be at play here?  How much better would it be to really invest in those people assets to either get them the skills needed or help them find a great match for their skills and experience in another group?) I have had amazing bosses and brilliant colleagues suddenly disappear from the company because some GM or VP had to meet a quota number set by some HR ""expert"","
good,Management has a lot to learn about treating its employees fairly when it comes to compensation / bonuses  and rewards for performance in return for hard work.
good,"Microsoft is a excellent company to work with, immense opportunity to learn & grow but few bad managers & poor HR process had taken the company to the wrong direction."
good,"Balanced working culture, your decisions also counts in the Implementing the functionalities. But there is no Job Security, We don't know when do they end the contract, Be Ready to switch to different technologies."
good,I haven't worked at Microsoft for 7 years. In that time the CEO has changed so my experience there probably doesn't matter at all. The company seems to have completely changed.
good,"Buen paso para una buena evolución. No obstante, no le dan valor al entrenador."
good,"Tough environment, very political, but well paid and good benefits.   Can be super stressful and tends to burn people out with limited promotion opportunities, but if you can stand the pace and manage the politics it does pay well, provide good work/life flexibility, and have great benefits."
good,I worked in the interactive entertainment division within the global supply chain team.  The environment was incredibly casual and fostered an environment of collaboration.
good,"Not a lot of work life balance. Politics, typical D&I issues. Nice benefits. Good training. Most days are busy with meetings and multiple emails. Good people work at this company."
good,"The Intellectual Property Legal Group at Microsoft is poorly managed. Experienced long-time employees are overlooked for advancement to higher levels in favor of inexperienced, junior applicants from outside the company. Employees are purposely targeted and treated poorly if they are not liked, without regard to performance."
good,"I was handed a the work of an employee who left.  He was on that independently worked on his own projects.  When I took that over my boss said I did really well and added some more work.  I was able to create my own team.  We did a great job of keeping up on our own and filling in the boss when needed.  Our boss had no clue what anyone was doing.  When we were added on another project (yes 3 projects to keep up with now), we were able to organize it well and had the help of our whole team on specific days.  Well later on my boss decided it would be a great idea to switch things around and handed our projects off to someone else and wanted us to train them in a very minimal time frame.  Needless to say that didn't work out well.  The team slowly diminished and everyone left that team."
good,"Microsoft is a great place to work, if you can handle the pressure.  It's not just that your work is constantly being evaluated, it is, and that's fine, but you are also asked to constantly provide proof of your value to the company.  Constantly.   What I'm saying is that doing great work isn't enough, you have to be skilled at demonstrating to management the value your work brings to Microsoft (if you weren't a PowerPoint expert before working at Microsoft, you will be), you literally have to quantify the measure of your work constantly.  That may be easy to do in a sales or account manager role, but in an IT role, that's often difficult to do, but you HAVE to do it, and that, in my opinion, adds unnecessary stress to the role. "
good,"l had a great experience there I just did not like the morning meetings and morning pep-talks to get you going. Did not need them at all. Would have liked if management did not try to burn me for doing the right thing. Would have liked if upper management and HR did their jobs a little better. Would have liked if there was not a buddy buddy system of hiring, promotion and just being a member of the team. Everyone looks to management for guidance and direction but when management is the problem, who is there to go to? That is my problem with Microsoft. Management sticks with management and not the employees. If you are there friend and follow what they like then you are good with them. If not, you are screwed. No matter how right you are."
good,"Management did not seem vested in, or incentivized by, the success of all employees.  Objective success criteria for the role were never determined and communicated.  Expectations were only communicated after the fact when apparently they weren't met; and feedback was either vague or nit-picky.  ""At your grade level you should know what the expectations are"".  Stack ranking still happens and is challenging when you can't see status of your peers and your manager isn't an advocate for you.  Annual reviews had too many negative surprises."
good,"I enjoyed my position with Microsoft, even though it was a temporary gig as a contractor.  It is a good company with good solutions, and I only wish they had the same loyalty for their people that they expect from them."
good,"Not as fun as I initially thought it would be, but it was nice to get to know some co-workers during the experience. Testing the Xbox One before it was released was very exciting, even if I ended up testing a game I didn't care much for. Most of my job involved searching for tedious flaws and other things that would make the game difficult to play, and even if it gets tiring or monotonous, I still enjoy it over other work activities in my lifetime. Unfortunately, everyone contracted here tends to have an ""every man for himself"" mentality, so even after the games we tested were released, most, if not, all co-workers failed to keep in touch with me, which is disappointing, because I like making friends in the workplace."
good,Was packed with very determined and reliable people who worked very well together in an atmosphere of cooperation.  Management of the group at a high level provided very little stability and a constant sense of worry.
good,"Contractors are not made to feel part of the team and are micro managed. Alcohol/ beer encouraged in meetings and non drinkers are looked down upon- "
good,i had a contract job so it was a little different. as a contractor you always felt like a second class citizen. the full timers were cliquey. and in UR there was verrry slight chance for any contractors to convert to full time
good,"As a contractor, I had the opportunity to use a wide variety of tools and applications. Also, because of the nature of the job, contractors don't get trained as they are not going to be on the role for too long. This situation made me push myself and expand my comfort zone. I was able to turn around a be productive in a very short time. It prepares you for challenging roles."
good,"Needed to go for it, instead of quitting on the USA. Our factory was producing the highest quality rated Microsoft product and they just folded it up and headed to China..."
good,The manager made it very uncomfortable for all the employees to work for him. Many employees quite all at the same time and had private calls to the the manager's direct report.
good,"Busy, fast paced, new challenges"
good,"Many subcultures make up MSFT and they are not always compatible. Overall, company is doing well, but don't believe the favorable press about culture changes, it's very competitive internally and that's not always healthy."
good,"This was a great job initially with plenty of opportunity. However, the continuous movement of people between teams caused the direction of my project to change with little clarity on what was expected. Lack of opportunity was a key factor for my decision to leave."
good,"Not going to add any more details on this company. It varies from one engineer to another, but my overall feelings are too subjective to be of value to anyone reading this."
good,At Microsoft so much of your advancement and bonus depends on your manager and they can often be easily swayed by their own advancement or asks from their manager.
good,"As a senior manager there was politics that impeded performance and objectives.  Microsoft is a great company to be ""From"".  The experience is good, but it is not long term, and you are exposed to more bad managers than good."
good,"The company is great if you only want to be part time, But the management team break all the rules, Don't do what they preach, And will tell you they will promote someone once they have a spot for them and then go and hire someone outside the company"
good,"I came in as a fledgling tech, grew my skills, and it was a good experience.   "
good,"The company acts like many companies all under one roof. It's constantly changing it's focus and identity. It's fast paced and not everyone stays in sync. There are a handful of strong leaders that lead by example and there are others that don't. Good company, but you need to stay agile. Biggest con is way too many politics."
good,"This is a great place to work! If you love the ability to learn and grow in so many different and iconic technical organizations, then this is a company for you!"
good,"Full time is where its at at Microsoft. As a vendor for them I don't have the best experience but I am sure that others have had better ones."
good,"I found the hardest part of working here dealing with politics and inability to trust managers.  The technical problems were overshadowed by all of this, which is truly unfortunate.  Yes they ""treat you well"" with benefits and perks, but don't expect that you'll learn a lot on the job technically or be able to advance purely on your merits."
good,"Microsoft is definitely an amazing company. The benefits you receive are one of the best you'll ever find. The work/life balance is tough, they require a lot of flexibility which can affect personal plans. They do not promote within as often than hiring outside of the company."
good,MSR is a great place to work in. Good work life balance. Great people to work with. However management in HR is not great. They could use better personnel policies.
good,Worked many overtime hours and learned system setup as a vendor.  Really like the Microsoft employees I worked with.  Worked hard because it made a difference.
good,To many “clicks” and politics when it comes to advancement. Experience is never rewarded with the advancing jobs. Top leadership disregards professionalism and hard work
good,"Apart from managers who really suck at their jobs, everything is in place and its a great place to work."
good,"A very relaxed setting full of good people, a clean environment, but not very organized. The work schedules not 100% set so you would depend on supervisor to tell you when to clock in on a day to day basis."
good,Aivan mahtavaa päästä kokemaan Amerikkalaista yrityskulttuuria ja heidän liiketapojaan. Johdon tulostavoitteet korkealla ja tulos tai ulos periaate näkyy toimintamalleissa. Kansainvälinen työyhteisö ja innostavat työkaverit työn suola ja sokeri.
good,Strong culture. Good place to learn. Smart people with good technical and business skills.
good,Not a bad place to work but got less and less about sticking to your commitments to getting pushed to move to a different department. Management took some of the fun away after starting weekly one on ones.
good,"we get training on new things and application."
good,"As with most jobs it will really come down to the team  you're working on. I was very fortunate to work with a great team. However due to Microsofts work culture I feel there was more pressure to talk about all of the good work you were doing, rather than actually putting the customer first."
good,"This job is great for one who already knows what they want, where they're going, and are seasoned in their profession."
good,"Great company, but too ""Redmond centric"", meaning that unless you  are willing to relocate to Seattle the job growth opportunities can be rather limited depending on your location/business group."
good,"vuonna 2014 siirryimme Nokiasta Microsoftin omistukseen - alussa kaikki näytti olevan hyvin mutta sitten kun aloimme enemmän ja enemmän käyttämään esim MS työkaluja ja ""kulttuuria"" alkoi kieltämättä monia tympimään. Salon yksikön loppu ja muutamien satojen (esim minä) jatkooonpääsy ja siirto Espooseen oli näin jälkikäteen katsottuna uskomaton koska alashan koko MMO ajettiin puolessa vuodessa sitten."
good,I work with a company who handles Microsoft projects. Our project was a pilot project. We have exceeded Microsoft goals and they have decided to bring new business. Convergys has a ping pong able and a foosball table where employees can unwind. The work environment is great here.
good,"I was surrounded by extremely talented people that did good work, but it was often hard to see that work realized."
good,The cafeteria was the best place to be . There were tons of options. They also had a starbucks on campus. The personal rooms were great to relax for your hour break.
good,"Learned a lot of the internal tools and software"
good,"It is a good place to work as a newly graduated engineer. Must be willing to do as you are told and independent thinking is frowned on."
good,"Poste agréable, autonomie sur le planning, ses rendez vous."
good,"Een bedrijf dat zeer voorop loopt met het nieuwe manier van werken. Flexplekken en de mogelijkheid bieden thuis te werken. Prettige sfeer en geweldig gelegen kantoor locatie op Schiphol met een prachtig uitzicht op Schiphol en de vliegbanen. "
good,"Daily work hours were flexible, but there were quite often conference calls at all hours of the night (e.g. 2-3am) to suit US time zone. Working from home is possible if it fits with the team. Management varies depending on the department. Some great, some not. Immediate co-workers and team members were great. Wider Microsoft teams were very closed off, non-supportive, and non-communicative. Hardest part of the job was feeling like we always had to do more with less in a shorter timeframe, and compromise on features of the product. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people in the immediate team who were always friendly and supportive."
good,"The company is extremely structured with very little emphasis on personal growth and doing what is right. Everyone there is fun to work with for the most part, however management only cares about looking good and not about the depth of the work or the person behind it."
good,"The company is amazing. Their benefits are second only to maybe Apple, from what I had heard from previous employees. They give even PART-TIME employees healthcare. Granted, full-time employees get more, it still speaks volumes of the company. Never before have I encountered a company so involved at even the lowest, entry level. We would frequently have big names come to the store, and even have big wig Xbox affiliates/execs come in to check out how things were. "
good,The coworkers are the best and keep you wanting to come to work everyday. The environment is up beat and fast paced. Be prepared to work 50+ hours week. Not always a bad thing unless your going to school. The companies politics are a little out of hand but it is a huge company to say the least. The division was growing a little too fast for its own good and is falling apart. The strength that bound the quality of people together is no longer there and felt like a difference place completely. Great place to work for though and hopefully it comes back together soon.
good,"good place to work"
good,"There are good managers, solid work and a nice campus.  However, it can be challenging to be a vendor worker as seating is limited in some locations.  You are frequently pushed out of offices to make room for full time employees and find yourself camping in the cafeteria in order to have access to the corporate wireless network and still have a place to sit."
good,"The most ineffective company to that I have ever seen. Unbelievable politics and inefficiencies.  From the outside looking in, one would never imagine how lacking process and procedure exist here."
good,the company provided a free motivation of job satisfication and a rigid work platform and the company developed the ability to work in a compact ideas and solutions.
good,The company is so large and so fixated on targets it is very difficult to get things done collaboratively with other units.
good,"it was awesome experiancce,"
good,"By the nature of being so large, it's almost natural that Microsoft have a wide selection of things to work on. It's a bit of an odd one, though. There's definitely some internal issues that are being resolved. Management is not the best and the work/life balance is pushing in the direction of over working."
good,"At slightly higher levels, e.g. Lead level, it becomes all about who you please and project yourself to.  You need to know the political arena and be willing to play in it."
good,"The politics in the company is intense and most decisions are taken before meetings are actually held."
good,"People are very intelligent. However, lots of politics in this company."
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Microsoft is that you are surrounded by very smart people and great technology. A big corporation can be a challenge as things move a little bit slower but it has the advantage that you can move jobs and still stay with the same company.
good,"i loved to work here. "
good,"Work starts from 10 and continues till late in night (many times till 9-10 PM) Skills involved with OJT, many features of recently launched software from Microsoft. Poor management with not so wide view and analytical skills of market they were trying to penetrate. Bad image of company among dealers and distributors. Not a lot of enjoyable time was spent with the employer."
good,They implemented the bell curve employee rating system there when i first got on. The culture and satisfaction took a dive after that when ratings became arbitrary and dependent on how much brown-nosing one did with the current manager.
good,"As a vendor contractor, I've noticed that the culture and attitudes toward vendor contractors has changed over the years. You still get a great work/life balance as a contractor if you know how to manage expectations."
good,"Microsoft is not what it used to be."
good,"- Estudo e Aplicação de técnicas e logica de programação em C# e XAML"
good,"Good place to work if you join good team."
good,"Place burns you out after a few years.  They talk a lot about ""work/life"" balance, but it's more like work/work balance.  If you have any outside interests (read: non-MS-related) that take time away from working extra hours at work then think again about working for MS.  You can have some non-MS-related interests/hobbies, and you can do them outside of business hours, but due to the MS culture, you will fall behind because your peers will work extra hours outside of business hours either at work after you leave, or by working from home.  The end result is they look better than you when review time comes around, and you get the negative review."
good,"Good Job. Good Salary. Great Benefits. "
good,"Generally good work environment. Some groups still have individual offices (great for accomplishing intellectual work), however other groups don't even have cubicles - just open spaces (very distracting)."
good,"I supported the VP of Corporate Counsel for Electronics and Devices along with the Interactive Business Group for Windows 7, Xbox 360 and entertainment. A great group of paralegals who are knowledgeable and fun to be around. You definitely have your work cut out for you when working within LCA. No telecommute options but the managers are totally hands off."
good,-CALL CENTER ENVIRONMENT
good,Work-life balance varies by team and role. Some teams are more collaborative than others. Overall a good company to work for.
good,"Microsoft is an aggressive place to work - networking and managing up is critical, as perception (rather than actual performance) is key to success."
good,"Working in the financial department it was not very stimulating. However there is a great work environment, people are mostly flexible and there is a good work life balance."
good,"Numerous opportunities to take on big projects, but the review model does not encourages cooperation. In fact, it encourages too much internal competition and making yourself look good."
good,worked in a sales organization for the first time. Microsoft was inward (and not customer) focused.
good,"If you love programming, everything will fall into place. Passive-Agressive culture is hard to adapt to at times."
good,worked late night and on weekends also. Management was strict and not helpful. Learned to deal hard time
good,"Microsoft demands a lot of its employees and rewards them with a nice health care package, decent vacation pay, and occasional other perks (merchandise, group outings, etc.). Unfortunately, tides are shifting and more of those perks are being phased out as cost-saving measures and business efficiency become the company's primary focus."
good,I had mostly good experiences at MS. A good place to acquire and expand new technogolies. the working environment leaves a lot to be desired. I have left the start and end dates for this blank because I have had some 10 contracts at MS
good,"Challenging work. Involved many groups and individuals in order to deliver on the projects. Management at the company still not a strength though."
good,"Increasingly sales oriented, internally focused on metrics versus customer needs."
good,"I grew at the company in the busiest location, very hectic, but rewarding.  the management was usually great and the coworkers were that of typical retail, although the work required a vast amount of knowledge.  The roughest part of the job was knowing a lot and being constantly utilized.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having fun while having my knowledge used as needed."
good,"Excellent, overall good experience, learnt various tools and technologies, opportunity to work in various streams and groups. I had a good interaction with the stakeholders, cross teams and offshore teams based on the various projects."
good,"Overall MS is a great company to work for and the people you work with are amazing.  The time I spent at MS taught me a lot and would recommend working for MS if your given the opportunity,"
good,Do not hire full time Administration staff only contract working.  Not great for job security.  I only worked there for a short time as a contractor so have noting further to comment on
good,"The tech culture is a great one, many of the employees are sneaker-wearing jeans lay back kind of employees. "
good,Worked with customers and worked on their Azure problems and worked to a resolution. This was Network related to their Azure Networking environment. The issues were tracked on a ticketing system and review by supervisors.
good,"Fun work culture. Meet different kinds of people."
good,"Company worked you hard when deadlines were approaching, but there were always plenty of downtime when needed.  I was always complimented on a job well done"
good,"The best part of working for this company was the overall Camaraderie and creative work environment."
good,Buen sueldo sin embargo el ambiente laboral es pésimo.
good,"C'est une entreprise que je recommande; Les collègues étaient sympas, il y avait une bonne ambiance de travail."
good,"MS is a good place to work with competivite salaries and benefits.  The type of work you will do depends greatly on the org and team that you are working on at MS. If you are interested in the cloud then Azure is a good division, OS'es, device drivers, etc, then windows.  Your team will define most things about your job life; work/life balance, advancement, etc."
good,"not much expected for most contracting position. they usually leave you alone. Many times you have to be careful not to do extra work. If not approved, can actually be bad."
good,"fun place to work, people are great, food is good, location ideal , hours flexible. facilities excellent, managers great ....best place I ever worked must see"
good,good workplace and a nice chance to know about the standard workflow.   also learn much about how to work with teammates together and make your code more Normalization。
good,"A typical would start from 8:00am - 5:00pm. Its all about teamwork. Everyday you have new things to learn at work. I manage all aspects of the calendar, including setting appointments and organizing meetings"
good,"CEO leads with vision and empathy. He's a great communicator and has been trying to change the culture there. He's done a great job in the 5 years he's been there but middle management does not perform at his vision. Within some teams, there is still that cut throat mentality and trying to change jobs within the company is worse than applying from outside. You do get a lot of autonomy but unless you are in with the cool kids, you won't get very far there."
good,"Pros: "
good,"I find most of my co-workers at Microsoft were smart, dedicated, and driven.  Microsoft has a relaxed dress code, flex time, and in general is a pleasant place to work."
good,Responsibilites and tasks changed constantly allowing me to learn a vast amount in a wide variety of areas. Teammates were incredibly supportive of each other.
good,"Xyz. Môi trường làm việc chưa phù hợp, Không phù hợp"
good,"Good atmosphere, co-workers were fun to work with. Training was on your own but there were knowledge bases and other documentation to rely on. Managers were readily available for support."
good,was fun working in the xbox group for this project on a world wide basis. good worklife balance and fantastic support from internal and external customers that were involved in the project.
good,I think working as a Microsoft employee is significantly different then working for a vendor which is who I worked for. Very numbers driven but still could be fun at times.
good,Your work schedule is never updated. It can be day to day to week to week. You will never now what you will end up doing next week. Work his a complete surprised. Co-workers and managers at Microsoft at great! Super fast peace. You will almost never have a day to recharge batteries.
good,Political but good work life balance. You can have a life outside of work but the politics do make the job stressful. If you have a great manager it is wonderful but if not...look out!
good,"Extremely fast pace, and due to the amount of employees that work there it can be difficult for the manager of your team to dedicate the amount of one on one assistance you may need. Pretty decent job overall though."
good,"Working from home is immediately a more relaxing experience, but the competition in between who's gotten the most in each call ran the way you were looked at within the higher ups."
good,"Our Team's goals were usually pretty clear and we met as a team on a regular basis. "
good,"As a contractor, to me it was just another big company.  I was in very few meetings.  I did not participate in any of the employee benefits since I was a contractor.  Did enjoy the various food options."
good,"Great learning environment.  Access to all Office 365 subscriptions and labs.  Full use of all Office 365 offerings.  Remote work which allows me to spend my time working, learning and researching rather than commuting in bad traffic."
good,"you have to fight for work."
good,"Me gustó mucho la experiencia , excelente ambiente laboral"
good,So much to do and so little time. Microsoft was just getting into marketing when I started working with the team. The approach was right and the new tech being released now is great.
good,"Then you are not going to have the same benefits as everyone else, this is why I went to cool and currently looking to make the transition into the IT field."
good,typical day was picking u[p customers cases and resolve based on customer request. it was fast paced place as they say and most of the time was stressful to work . management was not helpful.
good,"As a contractor, I'm not sure I had much insight into what an FTE at Microsoft really experiences. But my experience was delightful. Work was fast-paced and energizing, the product line was fascinating (and brand new at the time), and my manager was wonderful. "
good,I did not work directly for microsoft. As stated in my resume I worked for an agency that had these companies as clients. There should be a way to indicate that rather than being forced to answer irrelevant questions.
good,"excelentes personas dentro de la organización, fue un gusto"
good,"I loved the company and all it had to over.  I had heard how hard it would be on my work life balance, but I never exper4ience that.  After 17 years at Microsoft, my organization was removed.  Reorg'd out.  I never felt so alone.  I wasn't able to interview in other areas, just laid off."
good,"I enjoyed working with microsoft and working as team to achieve metric goals in which we more the exceeded in order for them to open the store. Yet, not everyone was sustained even and maybe to contract however, I loved going above and beyond and never intended to not continue to build and grow with the team as well as with the opening of its new location.  There are many things to learn there and they support volunteer work. If you want to pursue certifications, the support that as well. Its versatile and I enjoyed the experience 360. I really enjoyed educating guest and team members and the concept of helping each other out with our weaknesses and build our strengths as a unit. All in all, great experience"
good,"Need to have a balance and growth mindset to handle the challenges."
good,"This is a great place to work for if you are excited about Power BI, SQL Server, and Azure."
good,"walked around and did security checks, use hand held metal detectors, checked id badges, open and lock up gates, it was a relaxing place to work, management was always on site,"
good,"Management is pushing cloud but the front line sales reps fear it and the change it represents.   So, while the brass is saying sell cloud, the legacy sales reps still just want to pursue license sales.  Disconnect from the top to the bottom."
good,job was tedious and lots of head changes in the company mostly in customer service. on the job training was mediocre. not recommended for non experienced very number crunching system
good,If you want to be contractor make sure you are working for managed position at least. Never work for unmanaged contract or your carrier will be in trouble and hard to adjust back on track.
good,"Enjoyed the growth potential, working on diverse and aggressive projects and programs throughout the years."
good,At Microsoft you get to work with very smart people and if you are driven and can collaborate well will help you grow better. It does require to be aware enough to be at right place at the right time.
good,"If you are contracting a Microsoft outside of an engineering role, don't expect to be treated as anything other that a warm body filling a need.  If you can find good manager you might stand a chance, but corporate culture for contractors is pretty unsatisfying.  Don't expect to be recognized for your contributions, don't expect to get paid a fair wage, and don't expect to ever be considered for a full time position. Honestly, don't expect to gain anything other than a recognizable name on your resume."
good,"Microsoft overall was a great company - people, management opportunities, benefits, but was sometimes difficult to get things processed because of the vast size of the company."
good,"Your experience at Microsoft depends a great deal on your team. The folks I worked with under OSS were some of the brightest, most dynamic colleagues I've ever had."
good,"I was hired as an Administrative Assistant.  When I got there, i was informed I would be coordinating an event for 100 top ales professional from across the U.S.  It was to be an awards dinner.  I was given no budget to work with.  My duties included arranging air and ground transportation hotel, catered awards dinner, selection and procurement of awards plaques and prizes, after-hours entertainment for sales teams.  "
good,"Good place to Work. Good work life balance."
good,I learned a lot from this it helps me on things in life. I know how to work on the microsoft hardwear nd websites. It was a required to take that as a course in school nd it took me to greater places
good,"Like many big companies, Microsoft suffers from illogical policies and practices and seems to be getting worse rather than better."
good,I was with MS for 10+ years but an opportunity presented itself.  I was coached by my HR team that if i wanted to advance in my career I should leave and then return to receive a level and title increase. I feel this is the wrong message that should be communicated to employees.
good,"I have learned a lot from various different teams. I have had the privilege to work in Supply Chain, Xbox Marketing, Sales, Intune, ISRM and other organizations and it has been a fun ride!"
good,"This was a 3rd party that hired me for Microsoft called Mosaic, but we met official Microsoft trainers."
good,"work with the technology scaling up"
good,The managers at Microsoft were either very good or very bad. There was almost no in between. There were literally five or six different managers all doing different things and if felt very stifling at times. Overall okay commission based job.
good,"If you like the job you will only get by. Expect to exceed requirements that will not be written and compete with peers. Management was only good while they were your manager, and they used position changes as a way to excel current employees while discarding people that no longer reported to them. "
good,In Zusammenarbeit mit Microsoft haben wir viele interessante Projekte verwirklicht. Z.B. das Media Center
good,"what i didnt like is that i was working for SMB and that menas that your job more like a call center, and all my previus experience was for enterprice accounts"
good,"gives an incredible level of exposure to people at the analyst and senior analyst role. It is an exciting company with lots of interesting projects happening across the various lines of business. There is generally a strong development culture, good pay, and a good work life balance. The McLean campus is adding a beautiful new building in summer 2018 which is a great perk."
good,"your experience, and career growth will vary drastically based on the team."
good,"I joined here in June 2018; was very excited to be part of it."
good,"The company culture encourages protecting yourself by avoiding any work that is not directly assigned by your manager, because any delay in your work will affect your review from your manager. Everyone also values time alone, often closing their offices and making themselves unavailable through emails and instant messages. It can be difficult to get buy-in on a project from other teams, even for small things like code reviews or short meetings. Additionally, the PMs responsible for handling these kinds of issues routinely leave the company or move to different departments."
good,"In general, the culture at Microsoft is effective, but there are lots of times that projects are not completed. Typical day at work would be two to three meetings and blaming of personnel for projects not being completed. "
good,"Work hours are good, depending on your manager. Every group is different and has different attributes. I am unable to rank this entity as a whole as it is too big to put in a small box."
good,Learning Microsoft Exchange skills was challenging but rewarding. The more i learned made me realize how much more this product can do for a company and employees.
good,Managed expectations and provided master project planning to ensure all agreed-on deliverables are met cost effectively and according to project timeline commitment
good,Worked onsite at Microsoft's Bellevue office selling Dynamics CRM online and Microsoft Azure. I assisted Microsoft Account Managers in demand generation with Dynamics and beginning to end sales for Azure.
good,"Perhaps specific to some teams in the company as I've heard that there are other teams who enjoy working in their space. For those that I work in, the people managers were terrible. Can you imagine having 1:1s with your manager who has his back turned to you and doing email?"
good,"it was a temp job, I was their to restore information the computer system dumped and as a good will gesture to help the business owner it was an interesting job"
good,"Collaborating with teams like OPS, CSS, Field-IT, and Engineering to discuss and analyze various upstream, downstream systems, functional requirements."
good,"Starts off fun, caring company but those in charge change that very quickly. The higher you rise, the more of a typical corporate job it becomes. Boring, very political, etc."
good,"I work in a lab, not very comfortable, the tools are adequate, going thru multiple security doors to take a break is a bit much. I have no visibility as to workload, it just shows up. It is hard to meet any friends or social events. FTE's and temps are treated very differently and have very different roles."
good,"Microsoft is a tale of two cities. If you are an FTE (the Client) you are entitled to untold benefits, protection, and authority. If you are a 3rd Party (Supplier) the story is quite different. As the latter, you can expect to be isolated and under informed at best, or held accountable for deliverables without and authority or resourcing to carry them out at worst."
good,You wear many hats and if you have kids dont even worry about it. There will be a hassle in trying get work life balance. Lots of issues with management. and HR is a joke.
good,Experiences at MSFT will vary depending on team and manager.  I recommend trying to contact people within the team you are moving to and try and get feel for the groups dynamics.
good,Microsoft is less focused on customers and more focused on making money. I want to be part of a company that puts customers first and does not discard customer priorities.
good,"+) Positive working environment: awesome co-workers, experienced and friendly people; understanding team-leads and managers who would reward any work you did above-and-beyond; helpful support staff regarding insurance, deposits and payments, and day-to-day operations."
good,"My job is find. The people I work with, the work I do, the place I work at, etc etc are find. Stressful at time but find. The problem is the contractor I work through for the company. The contractor are clueless to this kind of work. They try to run a tech job like a customer service by outsourcing most the jobs off campus. The outsource worker are poorly trained and have no on site support leaving the on site worker doing majorly of the work load with less employee. I do more work then 3 outsource worker combined."
good,"Great job for those that need excellent pay and benefits. The group you work in and your manager really dictate what kind of an experience you will have here. Overall, great company. Just be aware of the team in which you are working."
good,"primary day consists of many conference calls everyday to discuss all pertinent projects, culture everyone is their own team member, hardest part is traveling all the time. most enjoyable time is flexibility in hours and location of work."
good,"Totally depends on the team.  Some are fantastic, exciting and rewarding, while others are tasked with responsibilities that are greater than they can handle."
good,"Pros: people are nice, a lot of respect to the work life balance, Office is nice, flexibility to work from home, a casual and relaxed culture"
good,If you work for corporate great! I would not work on the retail level ever again. Management needs more training and corporate needs to do a better job of checking on their retail employees.
good,"Contractors could be alerted before of being fired, if budget is not available. Other than that its an okay company to work for. Always look for other oppertunities."
good,I have been able to work with Microsoft for most of my life in and out of the educational setting.  I am able to apply this knowledge to the work place.
good,"The team I worked on was super disorganized, had changing objectives dictated from above, and wasn't really allowed to determine its own destiny."
good,"Microsoft cannot be viewed as a single company. Some areas are well run with thoughtful leaders. Other areas, not so much. In less than four years my org has seen massive turnover and changing business models that never deliver clear organizational direction. Financial management is an afterthought and in some cases seem to be deliberately constructed to obfuscate organizational spending. "
good,An opportunity to work with the best of the best.  A chance to impact the creation of the next product MSFT puts out.  Unfortunately the desire to get customers on their cloud (Azure) is blinding management to the value of relationships with customers.  Sales for people who shouldn't be required to sell is a poison pill for a trust relationship with customers.
good,"I think everyone has some understanding that this is a tough place ot work, they continue to cut corners where employee benefits are concerned.  Personally I was set for failure by my boss, so I my advise is enter at your own risk"
good,"Great company where I grew up, but like most giant corporations, they keep the workforce young through the review process and ultimately layoffs."
good,"If you like being on your feet for 10 hours in a datacenter, then this is the place!  Awesome place to start gaining skills due to the volume of servers and maintenance they all require. Need to be a team player to make it here. Awesome perks like snacks and coffee. Break room was nice and clean. Management was cool as well."
good,"Micromanagement and stress can be high, but if you get the right boss this won't be a problem.  It's a crapshoot.  If you like the management, you'll love Microsoft.  If you don't then you won't.  Beverages are free.  Lunches are good.  Benefits are amazing."
good,"I was a Recruiting Coordinator helping recruiters fill in the positions at Microsoft. The position was interesting and challenging and required a strong attention to detail, resourcefulness and quick thinking."
good,"The local office is not a good representation of the global brand.  If you really want to work for Microsoft, this would be better achieved in the US."
good,"Great place. Would recommend!"
good,When you are in Microsoft your work/life balance is very hard to manage. Too much stress comes and you will not get paid that much. But it is good environment and you learn a lot.
good,"I worked for Skype temporarily to promote a VIP event through advertising, promotional street art, and event management. Overall, they were a fair group to work for."
good,"Good job but you are not a Microsoft employee - they remind you of that (overtly or otherwise) each day. "
good,Good company to work at.  Lots of opportunities to pursue different interests.  Technologies and learning opportunities are available if you seek it out.
good,"Not sure how this came up for review, not an employer, but I did enjoy implementing and administering this product. It was very useful in the work environment."
good,"Microsoft empowers its employees fully."
good,"If the job is through a third party, then the employee misses out on many benefits. The salary can be good if you negotiate well. Management is alright."
good,I have been working with Microsoft as Vendor since 2008. I had very good experience so far and it was fun working with multiple teams as part of the task completion.
good,This still doesn't work as I was working at microsoft for another company and this cannot reflect what was going on in either company please update your forms for vendor type jobs
good,This still doesn't work as I was working at microsoft for another company and this cannot reflect what was going on in either company please update your forms for vendor type jobs
good,"It depends on the team you are working. I love some teams than others. But when it goes wrong, it is totally destructing. i can't conclude it to be good or bad."
good,"Our company was acquired by Microsoft, the before and after cultures were very different, as was the management team.  Many of my peers were let go.  I was able to keep my job at the time, but it was a different place to go to work after that."
good,"WORK LIFE BALANCE is a challenge there. Meetings meetings and meetings, you will end up doing your work at home although that flexibility is nice but questions the work life balance the company boasts about."
good,Overall good salary and benefits.  Can be somewhat political but overall a good work atmosphere and challenging. Peers are very knowledgeable and management has good experience.
good,the working environment is very very very relaxed compared to Amazon. Product manager were not very aware of the goals set by engineers. Hig job security.
good,The work at MS was challenging but very rewarding.  Products were pushed out too fast which did decrease customer satisfaction but most problems were resolved quickly.
good,Great working environment lots of pressure but great fun and job.  Day to day quarter to quarter you are always learning and the environment is fast pace no time to be bored.
good,"Typical day depends on the team and where you are in the release cycle. Few teams have very good culture and work life balance, but difficult to say this for all the projects and groups."
good,"Microsoft IT underwent significant and necessary changes that during this specific time made the work environment less than optimal.  People are smart and dedicated in all aspects with interesting work.  Employees were treated like numbers and resources and not respected as individuals."
good,"It is a good place to work and gives you freedom to work however the job security is very bad, might be i am a vendor employee and part of a core team but  policy is not equal for all."
good,Great company to work and learn. You will get to work on big project with high technology projects. Employees are techie and helpful but work pressure is high.
good,"It depends on which organization you are working for Microsoft. Old organization has heavy latency issues, and politics can be a big issues. "
good,"Project Management, Vendor Management, Issue resolution, Incident management, Resourcing, Worldwide vendor onboarding, Invoice validation, Coordination with Time zone leads etc."
good,"Frustrating, surrounded by brilliant engineers and we continuously shoot ourselves in the foot with politics, empire building and cross team fighting."
good,"Learning n beneficial environment, learned new skills and different way to achieve n built the tricky things in the simple ways"
good,"At Microsoft I was able to own the domain I worked in.  That said, you have to be able to compromise your belief in delivering a great product in order to work for some managers who are most interested in career advancement.  If you are adept at politics and compromise, you will do well."
good,"L'ambiance est détestable, les salariés sont des numéros qui ne sont pas considérés, seuls les chiffres et la politique interne comptent.  Pour compenser, vous travaillerez pour un grand nom qui sait encore innover (technologiquement parlant).  Pour le reste, il faut accepter la lobotomisation..."
good,"this was my first ""real job"" and it was a pleasure to work for Microsoft and get much experience as a contractor. I worked with many great professionals and loved it all."
good,"I originally worked in the field which I found to be very rewarding.  But when I came to HQ, I was shocked at the terrible back-stabbing culture that existed.  From what I've learned from others, it really depends on which business group you work for.  Some are great, others are completely dysfunctional."
good,"Great company, great benefits, but very difficult to stay engaged and involved when remote (if your team is all out of HQ)."
good,"Advancement is extremely political - not based very much on merit, at least with the team I was on."
good,"From driving children to and from school/field trips to multi-tasking in the classroom, business office, correctional facility, this journey has been amazing, challenging, and bitter sweet."
good,Challenging and rewarding company to work for. Great benefits and people.  Must be willing to navigate a complex corporate structure.
good,"The work atmosphere is congenial, encouraging and friendly. The colleagues and management help you achieve your potential and enhance your skills"
good,"Learn to manage multiple sectors , time management and multitasking. Handle various customers and partners. "
good,"Microsoft benefits and compensation is one of the best, but unfortunately it has a horrible culture of work politics. Hard work is not appreciated, but ability to make relationship with utmost importance. Basically ignore any emails from peers and people below and only spend time to do bare minimum for your job. Focus your time on your skip level and director/VP level. The more face time you have with them the better your review will be regardless of your work. Annual review system is basically a popularity contest with your higher up with the most say. Microsoft is a large company, I am not sure if it was just the department I was in. I would like to work there again one day but not in the same department to see how other parts of the company is like."
good,The work is interesting. There are plenty of opportunities to prove your mettle and challenge yourself. You can expand your skill set with great encouragement from team.
good,Good benefits and different projects. Lots of politics to go through though that slows down the progress. Trying to move to an agile development has been tough for many.
good,"Its a good company. They do some cutting edge and fast paced work. The only thing is there is no concept of asking for help and its expected that you work in silo. Apart from that, its a very good experience"
good,"While I strongly disagree with the stack ranking bell curve for promotions (even really good people sometimes get the ""lowest"" ranking), it is overall, a pretty good place to work.  Good compensation, good benefits and a culture that is quite collegiate.  A lot of career growth potential, especially in the Azure space."
good,The job is boring and not challenging. Co-workers were great but management needs so work. Never kept a set stander of anything.
good,The company has a great culture and its a fun environment to work with. The people make the day to day easy and enjoyable. They have a proven operating process and place for advancement.
good,My org was a great place to work with creative and exciting people. I learned many things about both the tech I was working within and how the organizational structures interacts with one another at such a large company.
good,"It's great to be working with many smart people come from many countries ( India, China, Finland...). I have access to many active work environment. can grow and learn many skills"
good,"không gian làm việc mát mẻ thoải mái,thời gian làm việc hợp lý.mọi người đều thân thiện hòa đồng."
good,"I have learnt a lot working at Microsoft, it has taught me the art of relationship building, working well under pressure, it has introduced me to people of different cultures and races and how to approach and communicate on different levels. Each day is never the same as the last, it was always fun and exhilarating and always kept me on my toes."
good,"Good company with a good liaise person with LUMS, good consultancy project team. Good environment of working and professional working team.  "
good,Điều thích thú nhất tại Microsoft là các công nhân ở trong line tôi quản lý rất nghe lời tôi.
good,"I've worked here for a long time and it's changed from a company with a small company attitude, being fun and creative. No longer agile, exciting company to work for. Became the IBM they originally were fighting against."
good,Local muito bom para aprender sempre e para vivenciar o Direito!
good,Great company with lots of diversity and opportunity. Leadership is frequently contradictory requesting new employees inject new modalities in play but then slap employee on hand when antiquated practices are not kept up.
good,"Make sure that you Balance your Work with Family Time, Its a Good working environment in Microsoft. It provides Opportunity and scope for growing"
good,working for the windows u crew was great. got a lot of free stuff and was able to meet a lot of new people and learned about new windows products
good,"While I understand as a contractor the rules at Microsoft, I did not like how I was left out of key org change information (which was public, but not communicated to the contractors) and overall left out of launch celebrations.  Never felt part of a team."
good,Reine Execution. Die Entscheidungen werden in Redmond gefällt. Man lernt aber viel.
good,I learnt a lot from my job and manger and the team were great to work with. Working as a contractor has it's pros and cons. Cons was you could lost your job anytime without any notice in advance.
good,"This team at Microsoft is very well placed in the Enterprise Client Management space, but needs a few years to really get to a level of engineering where releasing new features is really smooth.  If you're a high level engineer, be prepared to participate in a long struggle to bring the product to modernity."
good,good place to learn in different areas if you can better position yourself. requires self-motivation. need to maintain a lot of internal network in order to find good opportunity to grow yourself.
good,Large organization with many successful people.  People have the chance to move around every few years and try out many different roles.
good,Microsoft Consulting is a very immature organization. Consulting Management attempt to mimic big 4 and other larger technology consulting organization.  Too much focus on process and not enough on customer and product.
good,"It was my first real job, I have learned a lot."
good,Helped in assisted sales and training of the Microsoft Xbox Kinect though out Best Buy and Walmart store locations. Provided product knowledge to all retail sales reps.
good,"A Microsoft é uma empresa líder na área de tecnologia."
good,I learned a lot from my time at Microsoft and worked with some amazing people.  I take many skills and lessons learned with me
good,Great flexibility for lateral movement.  I was able to live up to my potential.  There is a strong sense of community within the teams.
good,"Great Company to work. "
good,Work Culture is good but there is lack of job security. Decision making is all up to management & a slight mistake will make employees suffer because of non-profitability.
good,"Great place to work, has lots of resource's. Great Work-life balance, great work community. Its a big family."
good,"working at the data center seems to be right for me."
good,"Lot of opportunity to learn"
good,"Inicio de uma nova atividade profissional, onde aprendi muito so gestão e desenvolvimento de sistemas"
good,A typical day at microsoft  developer inc. Is   commenting back and forth with the engineer. Enhancing and promoting microsoft inc. Financially.  What I learned was to talk and write as a developer like your  suppose too. You commented on what was or could be a ver.Y talkative you commented on about 2 to 3 comments per day  subjects  were what others talked about. You take the topic and write it explain it your way so it sound different?     The most enjoyble part of the job was working with my husband. This job was a volunteer job.  I worked 4 months its the most current job for volunteer work.
good,"Coworkers and clients seem to be very nice."
good,"Due to Microsoft buying out Nokia, we got laid off."
good,Your work life balance goes down the drain when your project is close to ship date.  Overall you have to deal with lot of politics especially when you are trying to maintain balance with business and technical teams.
good,I honestly can't think of anything that I would frown upon. I loved this job. Too bad it ended. I would have stayed a very long time.
good,"Jobs at Microsoft can be good and bad, and the management chain can make all the difference.   My first 8 years at Microsoft I had wonderful managers, and the job was great, a whole team working hard together and really caring about the product we put out."
good,Overall it's an OK place to work. Difficult to move or switch positions or be promoted though. The Support positions give a great opportunity for growth and able to learn about MS technologies. Probably not the best position for someone who is looking for a long term career.
good,A great experience to open the second Microsoft Retail store in Canada from day one.  The ability to do multiple 1 on 1's daily to invest in our associates was incredibly rewarding as the Leadership Team was able to promote ove 8 staff in my tenure at Microsoft.
good,"Flexible work environment, multiple, diverse, well-funded product development ventures, with the common objective of promoting and growing the Windows and X-Box ecosystems.  Highly motivated towards growth through acquisition."
good,good working environment and management very helpful. And its good learning for beginners too.
good,"Employees are always busy, no slackers. My co-workers were very approachable, knowledgeable of what they they do and of the company in general. Management was always willing to assist or step in in any difficult situation. The most difficult part of my job was the language barrier with certain candidates in Middle East or African countries and their tme zones as well when I had to schedule meetings with managers in UK or USA for example."
good,"They have their fingers into just about everything.  It gives you the ability to try jobs in areas that you may have a great passion for.  Great place for a first job. Teams are silod and used to work in isolation.  There is a top down edict to change to become a single company.  But, team vs. team was the culture before."
good,Smart people working hard to change the world. Plenty of opportunity to develop organizational agility and figure out how to deal with and make progress with lots of ambiguity. Hard to navigate review process.
good,"I was lucky to have a manager early on in my career, highly suggest that I should move between divisions and groups to not only gain experience, but to use the knowledge I gained to help deliver great products and services in other groups.   "
good,Typical day is very constructive at Microsoft. I have learnt a lot working with the team at Microsoft. The management was good and so were the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was owning a complete component and working on it. The most enjoyable part was having flexible timing
good,"I was a contractor at Microsoft.  I loved the work; very challenging.  Although, it was very difficult to get hired as a direct employee."
good,A company where technology is at the forefront and cultivates creative ideas
good,Company integration still on going from former Nokia Mobile
good,Microsoft is a large secure company to work for if you have a good manager and are on an important project.
good,"Fun products"
good,"over all a good company,  work could be exciting in some days,  but not other days.  if you know how to increase your visibility,   you'll survive the review system."
good,"Microsoft acquired Nokia Devices and Services with the understanding we would continue to make high quality feature Smart Phones. Unfortunately the strategic decision was made to reduce staff by 18,000 employees."
good,"This was my first professional job out of college.  At the time, a family owned bedding manufacturing company based in Seattle.  I learned a lot while I was there."
good,this thought me multi tasking also and the management was effective in pushing for success.
good,Very fast paced environment. Always work beyond your means.
good,"Organizational structure, management, and scope changes so much it's hard to get any traction. And everyone you need to talk to to get anything done is on vacation for a month. And no office space for vendors."
good,Nokia has been a fun journey for me that enabled me to work in different parts of the Globe.
good,"Good experience. I believe I need not provide feedback for each and every project I did at Infosys. An overall idea of it would be good to have,"
good,"•	Re-image 35,000 Windows XP & 7 machines to Windows 7 64 bit OS, and perform ALL necessary upgrade and change requests per users"
good,"It was a good job, and taught me a lot of different things about Microsoft and Networking"
good,way too managers to get in the way of productivity.  It's a great place to work but the politics and bonus structures are not what they should be.
good,I had great benefits at MS but the work/life balance was difficult for a family.
good,"Aprendí conocimiento básico de paquetes computacionales de aplicativos empresariales. trabajo en equipo, responsabilidad y rápido aprendizaje."
good,"Very Nice place to work, need more training and better data programs"
good,I learned that the stack ranking system of management is the best way to get employees to hate one another.  They have since changed from this barbaric practice and I would highly recommend them as a great company.
good,Microsoft was a great place to work.  It allowed to take on difficult projects and the make clients happy.  It also afforded me the opportunity to manage a team.
good,Everyone is very welcoming when you get hired on and always eager to help you improve.  For a Technical advisor a typical day is either being an Answer Desk Tech or Back of House Tech.  The Answer Desk Tech will assist customer that come in with computer problems and give them the best advice on how to fix the problem or replace the PC.  The Back Of House tech's responsibility is to repair the PC that the customer has left.
good,"Too much emphasis on personal advancement, not enough, sometimes not at all on project, product, team or even company. People don't seem to care for their peers, even when they work on the same project. ""I am not going to help you because then you could get a bigger peace of the bonus pie, and I'd get less"" type of mentality. It is sad, things could be so much better. The company is aware of this and making efforts to change it. As usual, only a few bad apples degrade the situation for everyone else. There are a lot of good people here, trying to do the right thing. You better be self motivated here."
good,"Daily patrol to the facility, talk to employees to find out how the day is going with them to eliminate any potential problem."
good,It was great working at Microsoft. I was surrounded by great technology and was able to talk with customers about it.
good,Worlds best software company to work for. Worlds best software company.Worlds best software company
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,"Worked for a year in the data center and it was very exciting, learned a lot. Management were ok but not wow"
good,"I had a great experience at Microsoft, but learned that it is very different to be a vendor than a full-time employee."
good,"Worked here over 20 years. Started when it was 5000 people, well over 100K now. The growth has not been great for the culture. The management is largely old boy, you look out for me I'll look out for you. Risk averse, no innovation. The review system is known for it's poisonous effect on collaboration; it's all that and worse.  I appreciate what MS has given me and allowed me to build over the last two decades but now I'm done. My mental health needs a change."
good,"With lots of smart and talented peers"
good,"During my stay at Microsoft, I used to make reporting and analysis of information related to the firm's cloud service. Probably the hardest part of the job was to try to summarise the relevant points of the report once all the information had been processed. "
good,I have learned a whole lot about display advertising with its different challenges.
good,Microsoft has some of the best benefits in the world. You are expected to move around a lot. Good relationships and exposure to senior leadership is critical to success. Calibration process is its greatest disadvantage to employees.
good,Microsoft is a fast and constantly evolving organization. A typical day for me at work involves working on various reports and forming analysis on data points for different business groups. The best part of my job is it allows me to play with numbers and analyze data which is what interests me and keeps me moving. 
good,Company is too big.  People have lost their identities as people.
good,"There is no typical day, which is a good thing.   "
good,start by writing the work plan for the day and then immediately swing to action
good,Pays the bills but pays little attention to ideas outside Ballmer
good,"O dia iniciava com a definicao de plano de visita, mapeamento e prospeccao de novas contas, plano de abordagem, treinamento do produto, inclusao das atividades no CRM. Ambiente com Diretoria e Gerencia muito bom. Agradavel o local de trabalho. "
good,"Challenging/dynamic environment.  Requires strong collaboration and internal influencing skills.  Fast paced, demanding environment in which highly adaptive work style is valued."
good,Growing product and support structure. Opportunities exist for growth and movement.
good,"I had an excellent first decade at Microsoft and shipped many exciting products. Most importantly, teams had independence. This has changed unfortunately and the morale has taken a huge hit. It's all about limiting opex."
good,"Rewarded for technology capabilities, not business capabilities"
good,"MS is very politically correct. There are many resources to train you, and help you get to where you want to be career wise."
good,Team oriented
good,sourcing recruiting
good,"Apesar de ser uma boa empresa não oferecia plano de carreira por estar em uma cidade pequena,mas era bom o trabalho e eu gostava do que fazia"
good,it was ok to work for this company. not the best to work for. the worker i worked with were an odd group.
good,• Working on Projects of Manufacturing companies.
good,"Microsoft is evolving from being an enterprise focused company to one which targets consumers in general. The company has at least 6 distinct business groups which generate over $1B in revenue, annually - that presents great opportunities to do interesting, impactful work both in the United States and across key international markets around the world."
good,"Management of my department has suffered over the past 5 years creating very unsatisfied employees. The majority of people in my department that I speak to used to enjoy their job duties but so much has changed, that now many of those people are looking elsewhere for employment. I cannot speak for the rest of the company though."
good,".i was working for 40 hours per week,i have learned patience and working i a busy enviroment with 2000 people on site.management was good and understanding."
good,"Good Place to work. Testing is Fun, but Im looking for more challenging work."
good,"I enjoyed my internship at Microsoft, though working on some of their weak products that everyone knew were some of the worst in the industry made me not want to go back."
good,"A typical day starts around 9:00 with partners calling from all over the Middle east countries that I cover. a frustrated partner calls from Iraq where i least expected that day to bring any business. he was frustrated shouting all the time about a price issue and i avoided him many times taking care of my more business generators' partners. the pressures rises up, tension spreads around the office each pulling one side of the rope. times goes so fast and you feel the day running away from you without being able to finish your tasks. and the annoying partner keeps calling. suddenly, in the middle of the chaos, i loose my tamper and decide to go for a smoke. there, i get a message from the screaming partner telling me he had a huge deal to close. I rush back to the office and i call him, then try to calm him down and i discovered that the guy was not actually screaming or shouting. it was is way of talking and i closed my day concluding an amazing deal with him. how i would have missed if i haven't called this guy. the lesson is never to rely on perceptions and never underestimate anyone no matter who he might be. I should give attention to all partners trying to better communicate with each of them since we have a difference of cultures. this is the hardest task to do understanding and adapting with all cultures and being able to keep one distance from everyone. the day ends, the deal is closed, all the tension goes. a worrior tired smiles draws on our faces. go sleep guys, tomorrow is another day!"
good,Things always constantly change. You have to be able to embrace change.
good,Opportunities to try out initiatives;
good,The daily work involved both interesting and challenging matters.  Very good continued educational opportunities within the legal groups.  Extremely good people to work with.
good,"The management team lost direction though. There is no growth there and in order to move within he company from a retail perspective a corporate visit must occur. These visits never happened when the management team changed, causing me to look for new opportunities."
good,Was overall a pleasant experience and was a fit for my skill set. If there ever was a problem that I could not handle on my own other reps would assist.
good,"I have learned a lot from working with O365 / Exchange Online for the past few months."
good,"Work life balance depends on the team to are working with. Benefits are great. Culture is a mix bag, again depends on the group that you are working with."
good,"Pay is high but ownership and bias for action is lacking. People want to talk the big talk but generally stay in their own lane and go home at ""work stop."" Still that mindset of making products for customers vs. listening to the customer and fixing issues they have with current products. Overly matrixed due to age of company and senior leaders getting a lot of leeway to build their own empires. Far too much time was spent ""massaging"" PowerPoint decks for executive leadership readouts."
good,"very different cultures for permanent vs. contract, i did both and i can say in both manchester (airport) and london (cardinal place) the best option is to go for contract!"
good,"I've worked at Microsoft most of my career, first as an FTE (when I was less accomplished) and later as a contractor. The company culture creates an unnecessary disparity between FTEs and contractors, which is counter-productive. Plus, there are too many re-orgs!"
good,"good environment and people"
good,"it was a good place to work, the benefits were adequate the style of work was good. management needs a lot of work. I would recommend it to anyone , great place to begin working if you're new to retail."
good,it is a very professional environment although management was poor. I would say it differs in location unfortunately my location was very unorganized.
good,"A big company with most of the same issues as a small company, but good facilities and salary to help you gloss over it. FTE positions are rare and coveted."
good,Culture dramatically change around 2013.  The compensation model changed for the worse around earning commitment based incentives (CBI).  Even if you completed the commitments at 100% the bonus was arbitrary.
good,"It was real fun to work at MSFT. People are very smart, talented and helpful. I learned a lot at work and grew in my career. You are given an opportunity to take your own decisions and motivated to work on  tasks/projects that you are interested in. Overall good compensation."
good,"They are still an engineering company run by men running their own fiefdoms. It’s an awful place to work. Women in management are simply there to fill numbers and look good in stage. The strategy is sound, products are sound but culture will kill this company with a few bad decisions."
good,"Microsoft has cafeterias on site, plenty of challenging work, genius level people to work with, and good pay."
good,Glad I worked there. You will find a spectrum of people with diverse interests and knowledge. Work is very challenging with mostly flexible hours depending on the team.
good,"Leads like to stir up competition between individuals and teams but overall the teams collaborate pretty well within a discipline. "
good,"Lots of dead weight, overemphasis on culture instead of quality. A great company to start at, but not much of a career path if you do not live in Seattle."
good,"Wonderful place to work if you are a direct hire employee, however there is a corporate business model that has essentially set up a cast system between direct hire employees and the contractors we bring in. We force them to take 6 month breaks in service every 18 months, which is bad for their careers (on paper) and makes it difficult to get work done if you are managing a large team of vendors that provide services."
good,Work loan is quite heavy and microsoft continues to cut the buget down which makes vendors even need to work overtime. Not a pleasant job to being as a vendors for microsoft.
good,"the job its self was intereasting and varied, and the staff (i.e. other contractors) were fantastic people and great to work with."
good,My understanding is that the company is evolving with new leadership. The company has changed in the last 4~ years. There was some dysfunction at the senior levels when I worked there.
good,Microsoft was a good place to work until the implementation of forced attrition and having to constantly compete with your coworkers. Everything is based on review bullet points and no one I know who was successful worked anything close to just 40 hours per week.
good,"super fast paced, competitive, innovative company undergoing a shift toward evolvingf the corporate culture.  lots of momentum which is fantastic and a reason to believe. but headwinds over next 2-3 years."
good,"The onsite culture is difficult to navigate. Microsoft fosters a culture of full time employees are upper class and contractors are a lower class even though there are more contractors. If Full Time Employees (FTE's) have a problem, its a contractors fault."
good,"Fun place to work, good culture.  I felt like contractors to all the work.  I was a contractor.  The FT folds get the window offices and are fairly clueless about details."
good,"I was a contract production artist, so my time was limited at Microsoft. The upper management was very helpful, great culture and enjoyed my limited time at Microsoft."
good,Es un trabajo dedicado a las ventas de software el cual esta ligado a una serie de factores externos que no facilita el buen uso de los recursos.
good,"Good pay and enjoyed working with a great team of vendors that took a real ownership in their work and were allowed to work very autonomously by the FTE management.  Unfortunately the experience was marred by constant organizational and management churn, eventually leading to outsourcing of my teams role in favor of cheaper overseas or local H1-B labor."
good,Môi trường làm việc trẻ trung năng động.Được đào tạo bài bản.
good,"Analog studio has a lot of great ideas, but has trouble committing to one powerful idea and following it though to fruition.  There are people there who are talented at what they do, but they're not actually working in that position; they're doing another job; one which they're not so good at.  They are then shuffled around to other groups.  Then there are the slackers who are shuffled around and not fired.  It's disheartening."
good,"Great people but lots of red tape and politics."
good,"The staff was very friendly and team oriented. Everyone liked to see others succeed. Work days were generally fast paced, but still fun and full of energy. The team had all sorts of different skills that they passed on to each other."
good,A typical work day was getting in at 7:30AM and leaving at 5PM. I learned a lot about the engineering and design process for the Surface products. I learned how important device lab tours are to the groups whom were fortunate to get to tour the Surface Lab Areas. Hardest part of the job is getting devices to executives quickly and accurately. I enjoyed the fast paced environment.
good,Some lucky people have secured positions here; positions they are not qualified to hold.  They exhibit a lack of imagination and creativity which unfortunately affects the projects which are pursued and the quality of those efforts.
good,Excellent benefits. Work life balance is terrible. Some roles require just showing up while others are physically and mentally taxing. Know what you're signing up for.
good,"Short term contract work"
good,"Having spent a fair amount of the last decade on campus, I have experienced the decline of campus culture somewhat. The global push for accountability has relieved many vendors of their positions and put heavier workloads on MS FTEs."
good,"Great solutions, constantly changing, always learning, political ( maybe not worse than others, but definitely need to stay aware). complex to get things accomplished. Overall great experience and learned much that will benfit my career."
good,"I am  on my second tour of duty at Microsoft.  I was there in the 90's when Bill Gates was still CEO, and I came back in 2010 when Steve B was still here and Satya has since taken over.  "
good,"Don't get me wrong, Microsoft Corporation is a great company overall but some portions of the company are 'drones' and afraid to make change. There's quarterly surveys that are give to 'try and improve' the company but nothing ever changes."
good,"While a good place to start and get experience, most people get tired of mismanagement and poor leadership after about 2 years. Higher up leadership does not understand the function or tasks of lower level employees and makes decisions that cause confusion and delay of process implementation."
good,"Unfortunately, my store had been closed down and not everyone had a guaranteed spot at the other store. It wasn't the best experience during this time. Our store was great, I enjoyed it there. The other store isn't so great. I wouldn't send anyone to work there."
good,This PG is having to many re-orgs. Many times leadership rolls are being given out without merit. Overall the company is a great company to work for with lots of opportunities.
good,"I will not go back. Just like Oracle, very boring company. I don't know what else to say. I was not impressed by my colleagues either. Everyone follow the rules. There are lots of rules when it comes to product design."
good,Need some diversity in management team in Mountain View. Need to improve the performance evaluation. Need to enhance the culture to be more fun and friendly.
good,"There isn't any structure or training to help employees new to certain roles. If you're hired, you're expected to learn on your own or find outside training to do so. If you know exactly what you want in Microsoft, it is the place for you. Else, find out what you want elsewhere. There is a MACH program for new college hires, but it is still under revision and isn't as structured as other college hire programs."
good,"The Good"
good,"Environnement de travail très agréable."
good,"No one cares for anyone else. The atmosphere is too corporate and impersonal."
good,"You're really relying on your manager to have stitched together a way to get work done, here.  If they're new to their position or new to the organization, it can be very tough to demonstrate progress and meeting your goals."
good,"I'd still be in this job if the management wasn't two-faced. Very easy to pick up and relaxing job to have if also studying. Management issues include not being paid for a month, constant changing and false promises plus lack of support or security."
good,"My experience in Finance organization was very positive, along with Digital Advertising overall. Quite the opposite in the US Subsidary- highly aggressive, and while said they were embracing the new culture the actions did not match."
good,"There are still some people in the management layer with a lot of slack and bureaucracy left. For example, the whole leadership team under universal store believe in hiring, retaining and working with people with who they have worked with before and newcomers from other existing groups with different thinking and approach are discouraged and shown the door if they don't adapt."
good,"Thoughts are based on one division of Microsoft, and might not necessarily hold for other divisions. At the root of the problem is the role of program manager being both product and project manager."
good,"Microsoft Europe was the place where I learned a lot as a front line Support Engineer ; however it was also the place where I seen that mose of the administrators from EMEA are just medium PC users :("
good,"The company is very good to work with however the work is not balanced the way it would have been. Work Life Balance requires a detailed planning and discussions."
good,"Management at Projectline was very helpful and transparent, always looking to help their contract team members. Team I was placed with at Microsoft created a toxic environment that didn't support a team mentality, or individual success. "
good,la administracion es de lo mejor sin embargo los procesos de seleccion corruptos hacen que la dinamica de trabajo se vea afectada
good,"Geen balans tussen privé en werk. Goede voorwaarden en vergoedingen."
good,Overall the company has been great to me but my lifestyle changed and unfortunately the job/role as consultant could not adjust well enough to keep me closer to home. The managers change every few months which was also disruptive to have to justify your work and existence every few months. If I wanted to do something outside of management and excessive travel I would have to move to Headquarters.
good,Lots of learning and growth opportunities.  Fun work environment with opportunities to work on challenging projects. Would recommend it to a friend
good,"A good place to work if you have a clear path. but easy to get lost in the endless sea of faces that arrive. Career pathing and advancement is not great, but if you show initiative and work hard it is possible. The team is great, and co-workers are solid and helpful."
good,You get paid well for your time but it is a lot of your time if you work global.  6am in the morning and 8pm in the evening.   Re-orgs are common so you need to be thinking about your next moves.
good,"Le cadre de travail est top, l'esprit d'équipe des collaborateurs, le goût du challenge, la bonne ambiance de travail.Une culture d'entreprise forte."
good,"Good place to work but less hike. Working hours are fine, and good allowance , management is very good. Work/Life balance is taken care, nice people to work with very helping."
good,"That era had very different business and technology landscape... Motorola was typically a hardware company, without the necessary internet driven dynamics and enablers to compete in the technology space."
good,Hyvä liksa mutta entisillä urilla jatketaan nokian jälkeen.
good,"I have been working at Microsoft as a vendor for almost 2 years. The people here are welcoming and understanding, and hope for the best from everyone."
good,"Changing environment, crazy talented people, unclear direction - still an amazing place to work and creativity and dedication not seen elsewhere"
good,"Fun work place with supportive staff. "
good,Another exciting opportunity to support training for the global agents who support Microsoft's Partner Network. Best experience collaborating with project managers.
good,"Overall I enjoyed my 15 years at Microsoft although the past 2 years have been more difficult with all the changes and layoffs.  Management and HR became more difficult to work with and everything was made more secure so if you weren't in the know it was harder to do your job.  They call it being ""tented"".  I loved the team and culture of the team that I worked in.  There are a lot of good people leaving Microsoft because of the culture change."
good,aunque tenia las mejores ventas por mas de un año seguido si no se estaba de amigo del grupo de los jefes no habia posibilidades de un mejor puesto.
good,Professional working environment.  But you feel like you only know your team.  Sometimes it is not very friendly across teams.  Sometimes people are not helpful because of job security.  Contractor is a contractor - rarely have a chance to join as a full-time staff.  No advancement except you may get a raise in your pay-check.   No benefits (stocks/shares)
good,"Good place to learn how companies work on a marketing standpoint."
good,"• Benefits - time off, stocks, health care, company store products."
good,"Good company, Work culture is great, but work life balance is not great."
good,Eficaz amable tolerante  acatar ordenes y rescatar información cpu microsoft
good,overall good people that want to do the right thing for the customer.
good,"As working for Microsoft, the job culture and great facility have always been great."
good,"This is your typical first-party game studio with a casual vibe and flexible hours. The passion for car racing is definitely felt throughout the employees: lots of coworkers enjoy track races, follow car racing, or own expensive vehicles. The company releases a game on an annual cadence and works as a very structured, well oiled machine. Most of the management has been there for nearly a decade. The hardest part of the job is meeting the ambitious deadlines. The most enjoyable part of the job is collaborating and becoming friends with fun and laid-back techie gearheads."
good,Passionate about creating customer-friendly web experiences. Experienced at leading multi-disciplinary project teams to deliver large and complex web projects. Organized and skilled at cross-team collaboration.
good,"A very competitive, high target phased environment with pressure from management."
good,"They days of Microsoft being the del facto standard are behind them. The company is a little too large and arrogant to compete with Google and Apple but upper management is starting to change. Mid managers are still interested in one thing your funnel and license sales. "
good,"Working for Microsoft, I learned that they like to TALK a lot about work/life balance. But in reality, the job always comes first, no matter what. If a project or certain tasks needed to be done in the evenings or over the weekend, then regardless of what else you have planned, you were expected to change or cancel your plans at the drop of a hat and work. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great team members. The hardest part was watching that team get broken up in what appeared to me to be nothing more than pursuit of the almighty dollar. Prior to being acquired by Microsoft, our team was focused and dedicated to the principles of helping others, saving lives and making the world a better place. We all LOVED what we did, because we knew we were making a difference. However, after the acquisition, the focus quickly changed from helping others to selling software and making as much money as possible. In my opinion, success doesn't come from making empty promises and pushing software on clients. It comes from being genuine in your desire to help them and then delivering what you say you will deliver."
good,"I have been lucky to be in some great groups.  Expectations always reasonable, but still pushed for better than okay on all projects."
good,"1st Job to take during my summer break, was more fun than work as it was assisting Customer play games."
good,"It's a great place to be challenged daily and I still learn cool things all the time. With constant innovation, you have to keep up with the fast pace. "
good,"una compañia donde aprendi mucho sobre tecnologia de informacion como de videojuegos, ya que la linea de ventas de microsoft es demasiada amplia, desde software hasta video juegos. de las cuales aprendi demasiado. la compañia si fue incumplida con sus pagos y sus promesas de comisiones y bonificaciones."
good,Typical work day is a lot of standing around. Weekends were busy.
good,"There are so many projects and so much to learn, it can be overwhelming."
good,"12+ years—some good middle managers, mostly nincompoops. Perf. reviews (end of FY and mid-year) take up1/4- 1/3 of all time spent working. Highly political, not,recommended for working mothers in particular. Lots,of male cronyism goes on. Hard to move up as,individual contributor. Women earn, on average, 10-25% less than male counterparts. A known fact."
good,"I basically worked at Microsoft about 25 years too late. It's a giant, which means great scale and scope, but slow innovation and a complex web of politics."
good,"Average"
good,"Good for work/life balance, not so great if you dislike big company politics. Good benefits, the pay is decent depending on your level. Your experience will depend on your manager and organizational forces."
good,My manager is in Redmond.  We are a small office in Atlanta and getting things done here is difficult at times.  I would prefer our work be based in Atlanta with a manager here.
good,"A typical day at work involves projects, managing a team and struggling to correct system constraints.  There is a lot of group collaboration both within the team and with business partners."
good,In my current job I follow the turnover daily comparing it with the opportunities in the crm. I acquired additional skills in using Bi and programming language software (also for crm)
good,"Microsoft is a huge company so experience depends on what group/region you are in. Pros are working with incredibly smart, passionate people. Cons are that there is not a lot of community or teamwork (for all their talk of collaboration.), at least in my group."
good,"Pros:  Exceptional benefits, great pay, smart & engaged teams.  Great facilities, food, commute options. "
good,"Software development is agile."
good,"Great company but only work is not enough to grow here. you need network, visibility and other extra factors which make you grow."
good,Microsoft Corporation has flexible work hours. Anyone can work from home. As a big company MS should take care of working mom by providing daycare facility
good,Great benefits. Working culture is different based on the location the office is based. Both management  and colleagues influence the working environment.
good,"I worked during previous CEO times. At that time, Microsoft was a political machinery where promos depended on who you know and not what you know. 100% political spin and little used to get done. "
good,"Great people, fast moving change environment. Pro-activity encouraged and rewarded."
good,"A lot of training resource , software and hardware with great benefit, with no work life balance. A lot of the manager very unfriendly to work with if  you are not in their circle of friend."
good,My manager was horrible !! I wish I had more support in developing me as an individual. If you want to be set free and never get any support from you direct manager this is your job. I was top 100 in the company and I was never appreciated for my hard work.
good,"Good mission, strategy, but sometimes not well implemented in some subsidiaries. "
good,"Microsoft is a good place to work at, if you have a good manager. The only problem they have is that they do not evaluate managers. If you landed under a bad manager, this will end your career, if you did not move early enough. I was lucky for many years to have great managers"
good,Wonderful place to work. Smart people. Lots of new technologies to learn. Managerial decisions and choices seem to be whimsical. Age bias exists but subtle. Good benefits. Work life balance
good,"Great company to work for. Changing recently some things for the best, some not, but overall good place to work. CEO is moving the company in the right direction."
good,"- Days were either spent in the office, visiting customers or holding customer conferences in the Microsoft offices."
good,Culture is fluid and there are opportunities for growth. Unusually heavy emphasis on personal network and personal promotion. Excellent opportunity for diverse relationships.
good,Lovely colleagues. Efficient project management. systematic training and assessment. Planning management is helpful for all employees to follow up the company changing in the new prototype.
good,"The work environment was always different, always moving, but the manager wasn't as polite, or caring, or understanding when it came to employees and the parking was HORRIBLE!"
good,No reporting line.  One has to be there own boss. Have to be flexible with work and timings.  One should have ability to put in long hours. It's an mnc and work environment is good.
good,"There are a lot of brilliant and motivated people at Microsoft that are great to work with. Working within or across teams to design, implement features and resolve issues is fun and motivating. From a pure development standpoint it can be a developers dream."
good,"The atmosphere is too corporate and impersonal.  The only way to advance is to step over others.  But the culture is improving, from what I'm told.  It is very difficult to transition from a contractor to FTE."
good,"Good work environment, but they are getting there in terms of exciting work and real impact being made out of India offices."
good,Fun company to work for with competitive wages. Microsoft is a very large company with diverse opportunities. They have a very high number of contracted employees so if you are looking for an opportunity to get in the door take a temporary position and see where it goes. My 3 month contract was extended for over a year.
good,"Great place to work; benefits, pay, nice environment.  It's obvious that a lot of effort went into building a great campus that caters to all employees."
good,"Its alright, you can find other places to work for and make way more money. If your goal is to work for corporate Microsoft then you have to have a degree and certifications. The benefits are good, they have tuition assistant for school. However, if you are part time there are some benefits that you do not qualify for. Depending on your managers some are good and some are bad. Micromanagement is a huge issue in some stores, most are over privileged with hardly any experience and undermining towards others can be a huge problem for some people."
good,"Managers are busy at MSFT. However, they are willing to take the time to help you grow. Microsott offers a nice environment to work while providing training sites, cafe's and supplies necessary to work."
good,"Peers and colleagues always helps us to raise the bar tad high which  i rarely see in other companies around. Workplace, WLB are definitely a big plus...."
good,Its a project base only and good for two months only.If wee pass the minimum quota wee can extend the project.But the product is cherry mobile to promote the windows phone.
good,"I enjoyed working at Microsoft. "
good,"flexible work schedule with challenging  projects, management is a need to know basis and not informing. Coworkers are mostly interested I their own careers at all cost."
good,"Depending of each department, but if you are under a good manager they will develop your potential."
good,"Microsoft is the innovator of the IT-industry since the 70's and has re-organized several times to adapt to market conditions. This culture shines through today, where everything is project based, focus is on revenue and the market oppertunity nly and in a very US-westcoast based way. GREAT on innovation though and a ver inspiring environment to be a part of."
good,"A typical day involved inventory management, product knowledge training, and employee development.  My day also involved customer service management including Answer Desk support for devices and software issues, product exchanged, and development of business leads for local schools, business and local government."
good,Microsoft es una excelente compañía con unos productos divinos para comercializar.    Hay varias áreas de mejoramiento como lo son sus negociaciones con los mayoristas importadores del producto y la lealtad de los equipos de ventas.
good,"This is indeed a great place to work at. Teammates are absolutely cool; understand and very helpful. With many latest technologies emerging on daily basis, the company is on par with latest trends in the market."
good,"Its a great place to work with a bunch of great projects. Microsoft just needs to get a handle on their future, purchase of Nokia was not a good thing for the company, because of all the changes in the company."
good,"I enjoyed going in to work every day at MS. My unit's supervisor zealously guarded the life/work balance for those under their supervision, We were always having to overcome technical hurdles resulting from software bugs or mis-communications among contractors. This helped ensure that the job never got boring. Day to day, the hardest part of the job involved waiting for the publication cycle to complete so that we could correct a mistake that we had already identified but which was still in the process of publishing. The other hardest part was when the assignment was cut short less than halfway through the contract by layoffs affecting our entire job category. This was had been impossible to plan for and proved extremely jarring to everyone's finances."
good,"Good Company, unbalanced work loads, not enough opportunity for advancement"
good,"A typical day would include contacting residential and businesses to promote and sell the company's fuel, worked to targets and consistently surpassed."
good,"Great camaraderie with the other slaves."
good,There is always something new and always change and challenge.  There is a lot of collaborative work and you get a chance to meet and work with people across the organization.  Co-workers are bright and push you to do your best.
good,"I loved working at Apac/Microsoft, but your job is not secure there. Every July 1st they do lay offs for no reason at all. They were still hiring new people in June, only to let 320 positions go on July 1st. Some of those employees that were let go, were some that were just brought in. Some that were VERY good employees. I liked my job there and I liked what I did but they need to work on that"
good,"Lots of smart people, all working in a bloated environment.  Hard to stand out from the crowd."
good,Fun work environment. Benefits wasn't as good but I enjoyed them.
good,"Good place if you are in the right group. Unfortunate that the culture changed with the new stack/rank review system. Have to have winners and have to have losers. Bell curve. All counted on exposure with peers in organization during calibrations. If you didn't have high visibility projects, you could be fair bad in review,"
good,A typical day at work would be speaking to every customer and asking them if they have any question about anything in the store. I would have to keep my area clean and make sure the store looks presentable. I've learned how to work Window 8 and also how to gives demo's of our products to customers. The hardest part of the job was to try to find the exact person to answer some technical questions about the customers device. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday.
good,Microsoft was an easy place to work out because I did not have to deal with micro management. I had the ability to meet my deliverables with no sense of pressure.
good,"Work alongside very smart and hard working people. Culture breeds ""hero"" efforts. Really helps to join successful business within the company. Struggling units force desperate measures by management and teams. This can be uncomfortable place to be."
good,"You were encouraged to move positions every three years which forced employees to continually learn and grow.  If you do a good job at networking, you can try out multiple career paths."
good,"Working in the Microsoft stack is never really that great, especially if you've come from a linux or other stack. Culture was fine, everyone there is a part of a big machine, and it definitely feels that way. The work was also very silo'd and I don't remember a big focus on high levels of communication, pairing, swarming etc. It was definitely the most ""job"" job I've had in the development world."
good,"Nice Work place, "
good,Supervisor was disconnected from line level employees and not credible. The company culture was fantastic and the benefits were amazing. Loved attending MGX
good,Most of the peers were smart and helpful but the culture and lack of process enabled a handful of people to do all sorts of things to obstruct hardworking and responsible individuals career growth.
good,"As a change agent representing the newly acquired Skype (at the time), there was some cultural differences and still-to-be-determined technologies that required further investigation. That and lots of customer journey research activity that played into how the Skype for Business was to be positioned. "
good,"A lot of smart people with brilliant ideas and job styles to learn from."
good,"In a company where are over 50 languages. Colleagues becomes friends and therefore a chance to reach corners of the world with their traditions. "
good,"I was an intern what do you expect ?"
good,As an intern you go unnoticed unless you are from a high end school. They give you work and expect you to know how to do it. People seem to always be busy. The good thing about Microsoft is that there are so many different people that work there and you are bound to find someone that you can connect with and learn from.
good,I worked for a start up that was acquired by MSFT and our sales team was absorbed into MSFT.  The company is very large and therefore decisions can take significantly longer than in a start up.  The people are amazing and most people work there for 6-15 years.  In general they expect you to have at least 10 years of experience prior to working there so by default the culture is very different from a start up culture.
good,"Microsoft Store is a very amaizing place to work. They give you the tools you need to succeed. As a Product Advisor ,we had the opportunity to showcase the best products in the business while playing with every new technology available."
good,The culture is very diverse and they need to reduce the vendor count and see the strength of their employees. The contracts skew the growth potential of the company.
good,"each day was busy."
good,"They have a good work culture, nice environment and very quiet. There is a big opportunity to grow and you can learn a lot at Microsoft. The management is OK. The hardest part of the job is you have too many things to do. The most enjoyable part is people are nice and they have different communities allowing you to interact and get to know people."
good,best part of the culture is the attitude of going after the defined strategy aggressively  with budget and resources.  great facilities and benefits with reasonable job security
good,There is a lot of room to grow. You need to keep moving and not stay in your comfort zone. Many teams could use your skills. The culture sometimes could be conservative.
good,Work/life balance was one of the harder things to attain.  Good collaboration between close teams but when it comes to working across silos (such as support and product groups) there is still a lack of interest in really maintaining that close relationship.
good,"to bad Microsoft is closing the plant down . thought I was going to retire here. but I grew with this company learned a lot of cool stuff that I can take with me elsewhere . not only was I a lead I was also doing technician stuff , quality assurance."
good,"Microsoft is the best company I've ever worked for but the lack of determination from management kind of brings the rest of the team morale down. Overall, great company but day to day work is dependent on how management is feeling that day."
good,"Zoals in een Amerikaans bedrijf te verwachten is, is de performance-cultuur sterk voorhanden binnen Microsoft. Ik heb gehoord dat de doelstellingen om 3-5% van de medewerkers jaarlijks te ""verversen"", niet meer zo wordt geleefd. Duidelijke en haalbare doelen zijn belangrijk, maar relatieve performance-meting (de minst goede medewerker kan m.i. nog steeds erg goed zijn, maar dat telt niet bij Microsoft) is op lange termijn geen goed idee, omdat het de onderlinge concurrentie teveel aanwakkert. Dit moet Microsoft helaas nog leren."
good,"It's nice to work for Microsoft. Challenging environment with challenging projects. Bureaucracy can be tricky though. Definitely not  a startup environment testing it not ideal, lot of wrong technologies used for wrong products (e.g web technologies to build native desktop apps, no focus on improving the perfomance, no a|b testing). Engineering leadership is not focusing on the things that matter"
good,Company is trying to move faster but is still facing the challenges of being a large company where there are several dependencies to get anything done. That makes progress much slower.
good,"working in time of 6 days a week at any time depends on the need of my presence in the company specifically receiving phone calls and fixing problems in terms of operation and disposition of goods and receiving of raw materials for the operation. productive and working with less supervision, know how to handle difficult situation.i learned a lot of things specially in dealing the clients, to all staff and human resource.what i like most is we have a good working relationship to all my co workers as a whole.with hard work and patience i did my work effectively and productively."
good,I had a good run at Microsoft but the culture and the way everything is structured will take as much out of you as you let it.   Some teams are better than others (sales teams had more budget while CSS was always pinching budgets).    In a corporation this big it is important to find a product you love or a team you love and then stick with that.  Otherwise you can be crushed in the bureaucracy of it all.
good,"Good working environment, good Management"
good,"You would think any company as big as Microsoft would have plenty of resources and plenty of places to hide where you could just go in, do your job and live your life.  Not so at Microsoft.  This is a performance-extraction machine: it is very well managed and you are measured, evaluated, stack-ranked and pushed very hard every single day. Work life balance is a joke. People work insanely hard and long hours, and they are some of the best and brightest from all over the world. Working at Microsoft is an absolutely great way to start or advance your career, but it's no cake walk. The performance review process is very telling (I was a manager so I saw how this works). All employees within a group (has to be bigger than 6 or 8, normally is about 14 - 20) get stack-ranked, literally, and put into top, medium, and bottom-ranked buckets.  Someone (or several people) must fall into the bottom bucket. Those folks get a bad review.  This means if you have a team of 14 absolute rock stars, there will be 2 or 3 rock stars who are shocked to receive a bad review and no bonus. Many of them leave. That's why so many really great people used to work for Microsoft. Also re-organization happens at a dizzying pace. All this said, I think very highly of Microsoft and learned a staggering amount in the 3 years I worked there. It's a bit like working on your PhD except you don't have an advisor fighting for you. In particular, if you are young, smart, hard-working and eager to soak in a fire-hose environment, Microsoft is a great place to work. I honestly think the more senior you are, the harder"
good,Great organization.  Pressure is extremely high so proficient time management is essential.  Huge volume of information and learning resources.  Never a dull moment.
good,"It depends on the group you are supporting, but the people I worked with were wonderful for this group. I would say that there needs to be more communication from management when it comes to feedback about job performance but other than that I was happy with this group."
good,A typical day at work. learned to work with other people. that is all I have to say
good,"atypical day at work would include, receiving calls from home users to rectify their computer or PC issues. I learned how to probe and be patient in learning and understanding the customer needs. How to communicate resolutions to the presented problems in a simple vocab. co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was the commute, as I was living a city away, none the less I was always there and on time."
good,"Great place to work if you are a full-time employee, but i you are a contracted vendor, you really feel like an outcast, and don't feel a part of the company."
good,"It’s a good company to work for  but they undervalue their employees, the union would be really helpful. There’s a lot of competition because of the young crowd but those always leave, harder to grow or move in different positions."
good,Microsoft helps bring out the best in you in terms of creativity and innovation. With a mix of highly intelligent colleagues and managers is a great place to start and grow your career.
good,"During my time as a contractor, I gained a valuable set of new skills. Although I do not come from a tech/IT background, I learned a lot, and felt that I brought a strong skill-set to the table. Coming from a very fast-paced & competitive background, I enjoyed the more laid-back environment at Microsoft. Every so often, I was able to use my foreign language skills, which I enjoyed."
good,Great culture but they are about 5 years behind in pay especially with the skyrocketing housing costs. They need to raise the baseline wage for everyone
good,Good place to work on a breadth of technologies. Ample recreation options to make work interesting. Opportunity to work on a wide variety of technologies.
good,"The project involved migrating Windows test automation libraries from legacy components to an extensible framework suite. I worked as a consultant software engineer in the test team.  "
good,A typical day at work starts out with catching up from emails from the night before.I worked with multiple people that were at various time-zones. Satisfying job because I could see my work reflected in our various platforms.
good,"The world is changing. Microsoft is not. "
good,"Amazing brand and value prop. Technology is behind new mobile first competitors very slow to react to new trends around messaging, photo sharing and social networks."
good,es buen ambiente pero se permite el acoso entre supervisores y operadores
good,"Its great company to work for"
good,"I was able to work with people all over the world. "
good,"Pros: Great place to work with good benefits and smart people. Flexible hours, good work/life balance. "
good,the company has great people on all teams and divisions.  The health benefits and stock are great benefits.  They use more vendors than hire full time employees.
good,"Very slow version control system. Can take hours to sync changes. Code bases have restricted access to certain teams, so it's hard to leverage code from other teams."
good,You will get an opportunity to learn most of the MS product which helps you to grow for free of cost.  Best place to work which includes work culture & employee friendly.
good,The company was a great place to work. The environment was friendly and professional. The facility was always clean. The supervisor were always friendly and understanding.
good,"I personally enjoy working without been supervised, and Microsoft give to you this advantage as along you do your job. So I always show up on time, and got my job done. Yes, some days I did not have long lunches to be able to get it my job well done."
good,"Skype was a lovely place to work, with a vibrant team, and with an employee focused culture. Do what was necessary to get your job done at the best level of quality, and then, move onto the next thing."
good,answering calls about user accounts and helping to solve problems with customers. Attending meeting in a chat room and only communicating via computer and headsets
good,dependia mucho de la tienda en la que me encontrara aveces habia poca venta y como en todos los trabajo siempre aprendes algo en este caso fue el sistema operativo windows mobile mis compañeros eran foraneos lo mas dificil era avecews tratar de vender a bordar a todos los clientes y no poder venderles por que en verdad no buscaban un equipo y lo que mas me gusto del trabajo era bien pagado y con audas de transporte y vales
good,"They really care about the interns here, only thing is my project could have been better suited for me."
good,"Pertenecí a un negocio diferente y de exploración para Microsoft (Microsoft Mobile). Y si bien ese negocio no llegó a prosperar en el mundo, fue enriquecedor todo lo que se aprendió en el camino, y hasta gratificante al saber que en el territorio donde tuve la oportunidad de aportar a su desarrollo (Perú) logramos resultados por encima del promedio del resto de países. Una gran etapa en mi experiencia profesional."
good,"Excellent co-workers who are driven to succeed.  Only main issue is the contract, and you do not know the exact date of when they will end the contract."
good,I never really got too much into the MS culture. Because it was only a few weeks after we were purchased that the new CEO announced  we were all fired.  Bad karma
good,"Microsoft is an upbeat, very fast paced company to work for. Employees are encouraged to create a work/life balance and take vacation when possible. I worked there in a contract capacity and while I didn't get to take advantage of all the perks full-time employees had, I still enjoyed working there. People are friendly most of the time and outgoing. The hardest part of the job was ramping up fairly quickly, getting the team dynamic down and getting familiar with people and their job functions just to turn around and have to take a 100 day break after a year. In my opinion, Microsoft execs should review the policy for contingent staff and vendors and create longer terms in the contracts to avoid disruption in the organization. I will say, I miss the free soft drinks and hot chocolate!"
good,"Buen lugar para trabajar, sobre todo si estás en una fase de aprendizaje. Mucha flexibilidad para poder realizar tu trabajo desde el lugar que estimes o sea necesario."
good,Work with latest technologies release from Microsoft and interact with architects and product managers on new developments coming up. You can definitely enjoy the work culture and facilities provided by the company.
good,"some teams are better than others but the team I was with was terrible - very catty and stressful.  Personality fit was terrible, I liked the work but everyone was pretty terrible"
good,"In seventeen years I had 17 managers. I constantly had to fight off co-workers that tried to either take my job from me or get our manager to view me as less then they were."
good,"Even though Microsoft on a global level is an awesome company, the local subsidiaries work completely differently and sometimes are very far from the mission statement of Microsoft Corp."
good,Provided customers with prompt service and quality beverages while being friendly and enegetic.
good,"a typical day at work was me trying games out and writing a review of the game at the end of the week of how i thought the game was it was all work at home work all contact was through letters and emails, the hardest part of the job had to be the typing or writing of the review but i always enjoyed playing new games giving myself a new experience"
good,Microsoft is a great company with an excellent CEO.   Middle management is extremely poor.  My experience was managers tend to like mediocre workers as direct report and hired intelligent workers to do the core work.  I found managers to be very insecure.
good,"Most people are nice, lots of people brown nose upper management, not everyone has good hygiene. There is enough communities there to find a click and enjoy working there."
good,"I have worked on seven different teams, in different functional areas at Microsoft.  It is a great place to work - they hire great people, and have a very fluid, open organization structure where this is accountability and mission, but also freedom to pursue your objectives."
good,This was a part time job that I did only weekends. The environment was very welcoming and the staff too were very friendly. The only difficulty I had was that I neither speak nor understand dutch and most visitors will always start with speaking dutch before changing to English
good,"The off role job as Product adviser at microsoft as a good pay but not work life balance."
good,Microsoft hired me through a temp agency for a convention they were to appear in. Microsoft itself was fun and i enjoyed my time their but the temp agency was very disappointing. I never want to go through temp agency ever again! They say one thing and do another thing. Very untrustworthy and unreliable.
good,Ambiente laboral agradable buenos compañeros agradables ambientes para laboral
good,The area I was in was very intense. We were put in a situation where the system was down and little training on work environment
good,"i have learnt new technology, with new co-workers. At beginning i worked with a group of students but finally we were divided to work in individual as the project was small."
good,You will be challenged with the amount of work but you will also get the hands on experience you need to be successful. Upward mobility is very difficult due to slow growth opportunities.
good,It turned into a temporary position. Training was provided for Microsoft Access 95 and Windows.  We then used our skills to support the Microsoft Access.
good,"Microsoft can be a great place to work at. However, it depends on which department you work in and whether or not you are actually employed my Microsoft."
good,Work work work. Thats why you are there as a contractor. If you work hard they will let you work harder. However if you make signifigant contributions you will get a raise. Took very signifigant work to get a good raise.
good,"Microsoft takes an entrepreneurial attitude toward PFEs. We need to find and manage our own engagements with very little oversight. These engagements are all based on hours spent and traveled, with limitations, and are subject to customer's reviews. The PFE needs to maintain a utilization rate of 76% to succeed at Microsoft: i.e. an average of 30 hours of billable time each week."
good,Microsoft is very focused on political strategy and if you dont play the political game you are generally outed and managed out of the company. There is a lot of fat in MS
good,"Culture changes at Microsoft started before executive decisions were made for organizational restructuring. Restructuring started at the top with John Thompson and Steve Ballmer before the cascading throughout the enterprise began.  Great benefits and compensation, including bonus program."
good,"Cette première expérience en tant que partenaire m'a appris à protéger les intérêts de ma société mais également de performer auprès du client."
good,Time management was the best weapon against stress and the key to maintaining a healthy Work/Life Balance. I was pushed hard to meet deadlines and have candidates have clear direction on upcoming interviews.
good,"All the soda and coffee you can drink. I learned much, but I can't go into that because of my MDA."
good,"It is tough to find enough hours in the day to do your job as there is always too much work to do.  If you don't have a good manager, it is tough to work hard and not meet expectations of the manager."
good,"The numerous major changes made department wide in such a short period of time including pay cuts, cut hours, furloughs and change in business processes as well as essential software used for daily tasks made it impossible to maintain an efficient workload."
good,Full time contract employee. Great culture but if your not a full time employee no room for advancement and benefits are very poor. Management need to learn how to communicate with employees.
good,"Work environment in Microsoft is good but the job security is problem to employees, higher management decisions are affecting many employees"
good,"- Great place to work depending on the group or organization"
good,this company is a Microsoft vendor. They have zero say in their people flow.Which is why overall rating is so low.They directly provide no feedback on your performance because they are in no way involved in the whole process.Microsoft management however has no interest in doing any HR work themselves. Plus most their managers do not even qualify to be at the current roles.
good,"Good place to work but the management is not transparent, because we don't see the implementation in reality gets updated but takes it own time"
good,"A day at work consisted of me working in the Repair tech and OEM department. I gained much more experience in OEM in terms of speaking with others by phone in order to conduct business. When I began the job, often times I'de have to learn how to do my job correctly using my experience because I didn't have much guidance, but the co-workers made the work day easier and actually made me enjoy working. The most difficult part of the job was communicating with people over the phone of various nationalities. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with my co-workers."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of traveling, training & Sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was the creativity. Creativity was one thing that was emphasized for me to use as a tool to use for trainings."
good,"Each team is different, the one i work on is very antisocial, they look out for themselves and don't bother helping others. "
good,"There was no fun for my position where I was working. My project was control by few of the Indian's idiots that they don't have a minimum quality of manners. I was being a different country than them, they treated me differently and unprofessionally. I had been treated so unfairly and badly even they felt like they are in India. I was very hard working individual but got no recognition for the hard work either! The working culture was very unprofessional. I love to work in Microsoft anyways."
good,"Was not trained on any software and didn't have enough time on my own to learn all the high end features I needed to know. I had two small children at home and could not be gone all the time. If I had the opportunity to be  trained during working hours I was hired under, I would still be there, great company!!  Also lots of product roll outs with time away from home (I wasn't told when hired)."
good,It was very open and relaxed place to work.  It was not micro managed but there was a different way contractors were treated versus full time employees.
good,"Microsoft is a great company that offers the best benefits package. Worth was only based on your region's sales quota achievement. If your region made its quota then life was great, but if they missed their quota sales people would begin throwing people under the bus to justify their poor outcomes."
good,"Microsoft overall is a great employer from a benefits and compensation perspective. The work culture is not as modern as you would expect and the management culture is still old school.  Having an impact can be difficult given that it is so heavily matrixed, it really depends on the team and individual management. Getting promotions can be very difficult."
good,I would not recommend anyone to apply at Microsoft if they want to advance in your career. Microsoft tends to hire people for management roles from outside the company.
good,Nobody else is looking after your career.  Create a career path and be careful of the land mines. Make sure your don't leave stones unturned with your manager.
good,"Although I loved the technology, career progression, movement to other roles and other groups, internal interviewing, was all absolutely awful. Hated the compeititve culture and favoritism, They screwed up!"
good,The temporary contracts are a mess where nobody are able to tell you what is going on. But the environment is great and the people are great. The work are challenging and it has a lot to offer
good,It was very different working in this environment! Very competitive and cut throat! They only wanted those that had a knack for this type of job! Anything less was just discarded but a great experience none the less!
good,be sure to explore your career options inside and outside the MS bubble after a reasonable amount of time on the job. Don't be stagnant. Find your career interests early and head in that direction.
good,A heads up warning for those with health issues do not apply for this you will be on your feet for 4+ hours and you have to be really fast at everything but if you can handle it and want to be challenged and feel like your doing a sprint all day go for it
good,"The work environment is phenomenal, you can pretty much make your own schedule. You also learn a ton about advertising which I really enjoy. You also get adamant break time."
good,"Scale of organization, and company culture of high achievement and measureable results, offers the opportunity to take on big challenges."
good,Typical day I would help customers place orders online. I learned to be open to new things and how to work with out been micromanaged. Hardest part of my job is when the company tells us to ask if we have questions but get upset when we ask questions. Most enjoyable part of my job is solving the issue the customer had.
good,"Working with several culture/countires  give me an high opportunity to approach in different negotation style and way to approch the business. "
good,"Agile Development Program Management"
good,"Creating new part numbers, building BOM (bill of materials) for all Servers, Networks and SANs worldwide."
good,"Aunque es complicado que la gente esté disponible, siempre están dispuestos a ayudar."
good,A day with Microsoft was pretty cut and dry. Our department was a resolve team for the online store for Microsoft. If a customer ordered something and anything went wrong our department would take care of the situation and customer as quickly as possible. The days were pretty repetitive in our daily functions.
good,"Microsoft is exciting and very fast paced. Management is more about making money than assisting you in your development. Extremely political atmosphere, almost toxic."
good,It is not same nice to work place as it used to be. Best people who spent 10+ years at company leaving in numbers.
good,"The work was rewarding, but the amount of time I was even called in for a shift was appalling. If I got one call to come in week I was lucky. Often, I was not."
good,"Tema Work, "
good,"Working at Microsoft is both fun and exciting. I loved being surrounded by a variety of hardware and software that was on the cutting edge of technology. The company does a great job of introducing new devices and software that will bring in customer, raise revenue as well as intrigue and have the employees engaged. The stores always have a beautiful and engaging design that allow for a fresh experience whether you work there or are visiting for the first time. The systems that are used at Microsoft are still very rudimentary and are still being worked on constantly. They are introducing new features to ensure that Microsoft employees receive the support and resources they need to make the Stores the best experience possible. Having said that the lack of established systems and culture leave a lot of room for long transaction times and awkward interactions where the system does not work the best for certain situations. As a Consumer Service Advisor, i found i truly enjoyed the details of my job and being able to troubleshoot different issues and hardware, however the check in process and resources used to complete services was all third party software and a very amateur process. Charging customers $149 for an Assure bundle that truly did not give them any true assurance that we can indeed provide a service that they cannot just do themselves. The environment of constantly being measured against others by sales numbers rather than effectiveness as a technician created somewhat of a hostile environment. it became more about ensuring a mistake was not made rather than assisting"
good,"From a retail perspective Microsoft can be a great company to work for. They offer stay fit bonuses which enable you to buy fitness gear on them, as well as certifications that include vouchers so you wont even need to pay for testing initially. However If you have worked retail before the company is still plaged by the typical influences that you would expect. In my particular building leadership was very broken down with no structure or communication which intern made my store have the biggest turnaround in the company.  They also show favoritism to some employees and a clear lack to others. Overall retail Microsoft is good temporarily, so if your going to school or need a second job it will work out well. If you plan to stay for any longer term expect to see flaws that seem to grow greater with time."
good,Collaborative environment great pay and benefits poor management poor communication from management and poor training  great work environment overall would recommend great place if you have a great area manager and training!!!
good,"Worked remote to help analyze data for AI."
good,Too many layoffs where you almost expect it every quarter.  Not a healthy culture for people to have to live through.  It can really impact managers if they are consistently having to layoff team members.
good,"N/A to Microsoft Corp.as we are a managed team and managed teams have limited exposure to the Microsoft.campus,employees and other benefits.The limited time spent on Microsoft campus was, though, every much like a college of academics."
good,"great benefit"
good,"Microsoft is a great company to work for, with incredible benefits and a solid company mission. Unfortunately, like most large corporations, smaller teams can lose sight of this, and get wrapped up in the day to day issues that may prevent efficient productivity and communication."
good,"Management from an IT perspective was satisfactory until the company began growing. Once that occurred, then they began to attempt to micromanage and it caused communication to fall through the cracks."
good,"When we were shipping Windows XP we worked 20+ hour weeks regularly. It didn't phase us. We were passionate about the product we were creating and the work we were doing. As long as you are in it for the long haul that's all that matters. If you are hoping to have a job that is simply 9 - 5 this isn't the place for you. "
good,If you are a fast worker and work hard then you will thrive in this environment. The people at MS are helpful and there is no typical day. The culture is ever changing
good,"This is a company I enjoy working for. But moving up is a matter of who you know vs. people and leadership skills. When toxic managers (not leaders) from the hight of the internal fighting days are let back into the company and enforce their style down to their directs with no feedback from senior leadership it's time to go."
good,Review the job description and apply if it is a fit for you.I don't have any comments to share. great place if you find a role that fits you. search ask questions.
good,Work life balance is great! Management does the best it can to accommodate for life's random celebrations. On top of that scheduling for school is reasonable within each role. Compensation and benefits are great.
good,"Good place to work however there is no job security not the support from Management for career progression, I personally wouldn't recommend anyone to join on a vendor payroll or a Contract role."
good,"It 's a wonderful company to work for, However there is no Job guarantee if you are joining as a Vendor / Contract Role. The treatment for Vendors is not at all good and no support from managers while career progression."
good,Empresa boa!! Recomendo!! beneficios diferenciados!!
good,"Many meetings"
good,"Having converted from a vendor to a FTE, I found that one of the biggest changes is the overhead required, with meeting after meeting. Pay was above what I expected, and there are a lot of perks. Depending on which group you work for the culture can change drastically. I was in a group where I was treated like family, and another where I was treated like a number."
good,"poor training, support. Good pay, ability to prioritize own work, redundancy abounds! Often feel like tasks are assigned just for the purpose of having tasks. Poor efficiency."
good,It was an unpaid short term internship that gave me insight into the Microsoft world. It was fun and it taught me team work above all. i was in highschool back then with week programming skills so they taught us so programming basics on visual basic which was easy and beneficial.
good,Went through 5-6 re-orgs per year. Not able to get management to allow us to finish projects before moving on. Somewhat ok work life balance. Good benefits.
good,"Meh. Pay is good, but management, constant reorgs and lack of job security. As a vendor you get treated like a second class citizen."
good,"Working at Microsoft can be very rewarding but also very frustrating. Work streams are heavily siloed so exploration into other work streams is difficult. Management is a mixed bag. Some are very good and provide great support, however others are absent and do not provide the necessary support."
good,Managing existing account and develop new accounts to drive revenue.  Have had strong double digit year over year growth for the last three years.
good,"contract administration and customer facing"
good,Microsoft is in the middle of reinventing itself and this is a great place to be if you are looking for the opportunity to make your mark.
good,"the work time is very flexible as long as you can finish your assignment."
good,"Microsoft très bonne entreprise, les formations sont enrichissante le cadre agréable ,les aspects les plus positifs du poste sont la gestions de son planning la négociation avec les clients les formations les démonstrations les produits."
good,"Very relaxed environment, most things are learned on the fly you MUST adapt to your surroundings quickly!"
good,"In my nearly 13 years here, I have had both positive and negative experiences. Overall it is a good place to work, with a good benefits package and competitive pay. There are also a great deal of smart, people who genuinely want to keep making things better. I find advancement and stability is largely political, and at worst random; unfortunately it is rarely based on great performance, passion, and drive. However, a strong leader can navigate these challenges."
good,Tough startup environment. It takes a strong heart to be able to be able to drive results as branding and technology adoption for a small startup can be challenging in the gulf and MENA region
good,Highly reactive group.  Very little progressive thinking and actions
good,management and advancement are lacking. It easy to become a small fish in a large pond. Upper management makes high level decisions in matters that they know very little about resulting in negative implications.
good,There are a lot of positions available that offer great opportunities but you have to go in knowing that there really isn't a work-life balance.
good,A great place to work very culturally diverse and wonderful environment to work in.
good,Microsoft treats contractors as disposable resources. The values the company places on people in low level positions is pretty low. That said some individuals treat contractors very well. If i needed a job i would work here.
good,"As the focus was mainly financial for the overall process within the enterprise, I missed the human care with the employees."
good,"Microsoft gives you unparalleled scope and scale for work and impact. Every job I've had is engaging and invigorating and challenging. But... forget career advancement. The only way to get ahead is to leave, and let the company recruit you back. Sure, some people get promoted, but it's way, way faster to leave and come back."
good,"Some organizations within the company have become rank with crony behavior. This encourages abusive management practices with no accountability and there is a fear that using the provided channels to raise concern would result in retaliation. Merit increases for employees who meet all performance objectives is barely in line with inflation, in my experience."
good,"The company has a lot of great energy, and passion and that synergy is certainly passed on to the employees. but when you want to grow, things can get a little tricky. Also be careful of some of the roles you end up in. they may not promise you full time hours and cut your hours without notice. depending on the manager, they may not be too welcoming to talk about it and efforts within the company to resolve things, may not always go as desired."
good,"The company is wonderful to work for in terms of taking care of their employees. There are lots of benefits and work flexibility. It really does try to look out for employees and is modern in terms of benefits and care."
good,"If you want to be constantly flooded with big ideas and lots of ways to contribute, it is heaven on earth.  The work environment is loosely structured, and everyone is driven to do their best work.  However, managers do next to nothing to control the workload, and often take on more and more work in order to demonstrate the excellence of their teams, and themselves."
good,"Microsoft is good company to work for but only at corporate level and not retail level. I learned a lot form some fellow employees. At store/retail level no one cares about you they just wants to get job done. Hardest part of the job is no one cares how their team gets job done, they just rely on one person getting the job done"
good,"As the title says..."
good,"- Planning and executing on marketing communication strategy"
good,"This can be a great place to work, but it is highly dependent upon your group or your manager. I found the people very smart and kind."
good,"Management finds females, even of the highest caliber worthy of patronizing. To the point of calling other managers who are female by their FIRST name(s), and males by their LAST. In public setting(s)."
good,"Microsoft is a company of smart individuals, but the team culture fails due to the compensation/reward system. While this system has been revamped, it still contains elements that reward individual rather than team success."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, trabajo fácil de desempeñar, difícil ascenso, y poco reconocimiento."
good,"I never saw anyone in Devices use the ping pong table or any of these things.  Most people worked hard with long hours and ate at their desks."
good,It was a nice place to work for a while. I enjoyed working for a well known company and providing exceptional customer service. I learned a lot about customer service and professionalism in the position.
good,Lots of opportunity to manage your own career and explore areas of professional interest.  Politics and luck perhaps play too large a role in career trajectory.  Management needs a better high level technical understanding of the work engineers they support perform.
good,"You feel that you're really making a difference, regardless of your role - front or back office. Plenty of opportunities to move into another role, especially if you're interested in working in Redmond, WA."
good,"Uma empresa com grande nome, grande estrutura mas com pouca meritocracia."
good,"when I first started this job a loved it the employees where great, the overtime was always there. the bad part about the jobs is that its always understaffed so u will be work 12 hours days frequently and 16 hour day right after doing a 12 hour day"
good,"Contract position, contacted MSN advertisers about past due invoices. Email was the primary contact method, placed phone calls as well. High volume of open invoices, primary task was to resolve billing issues and customer satisfaction issues. It was satisfying to resolve customer issues, bring DSO down and shrink the uncollectibles number. Our department did not have contact with the rest of Microsoft, or of Microsoft's Finance department."
good,"Having worked at Microsoft for quite some time I've seen many reorgs and attempts at cultural change, most of which IMHO have been to a large extent unsuccessful due to bad management, those who have retired on the job etc. However since Satya has taken over there is a palpable renewed energy at Microsoft over the past couple of years and the culture is definitely shifting visibly in the right direction at all levels of the company and I'm more optimistic in the senior leadership than I have been in years."
good,"operating culture is quiet intimidating especially from the management."
good,"Big company, lots of people - and this is a problem. People are not assigned teams per their skill-set or capability. Also sometimes people are not hired in the right group or division within the company - this creates mismatch in expectations and overall job dissatisfaction."
good,"As with any large company, job and career satisfaction depend largely on where you land. There are many opportunities to learn about a variety of topics and develop a lot of career skills. Unfortunately, it is very competitive and can be hard to set boundaries between work and life."
good,While I was there MS used the stack ranking system for one's yearly review. This practice led to many unscrupolus demeaning of another group by managers just to make their group look better. I am very happy to hear MS has completely dumped this system and is now focused on the individual's contributions.
good,"I started at Microsoft in the mid 1980's, when it was a 600 person company.  The following 10 years were exciting.  You knew you were part of something destined for greatness."
good,"My experience with the company is simple, if there is an open job it will always go to the managers friends. Even if they know nothing about the job at hand they would rather train a friend over giving it to a deserving employee who is more knowledgeable and educated."
good,Sink or swim. This is an organization that values self motivation and you will be rewarded for your efforts and innovation. You will work with very bright people who bubble with ideas.
good,The position required to travel every week and be gone for almost the whole week. Typically would have to leave on a Sunday night and come back on a Thursday night.  Sometimes come back on Fridays.
good,"Great place to work.  Great products, great contacts and there are is always something fun going on, on campus.  Our Monthly guest series has cool people."
good,"Our manager that they started us with, did not get a promotion when he tried and they moved him to another store after some stuff happened at the store. "
good,"I don't have a comment or feedback at this time.  The one consistent with MS is change, there is always change.  Be ready to move offices be ready for reorgs."
good,"Great people"
good,"Satya's excellent leadership principles are practiced well in some groups, and poorly in others.  It's the best place in the world if you're surrounded by great leaders and dedicated, collaborative colleagues."
good,"I have been at this company almost 22 years. I have been a contractor, vendor and fulltime employee. The only other feedback would be that I don't like with how often they re-org. The turn over around the company happens much too often."
good,"If your seeking a career in a hi tech company, Microsoft offers great benefits, but you must be well prepared to learn and drive ambiguity, with an eye on the competition in order to advance and exceed performance or you will eventually be laid off.First 5 years are the most difficult trying to gain expertise in your role and increasing knowledge to rank even average."
good,"Its a great place to work. There are many talented engineers around to motivate and inspire your work. They value their employees, but sometimes management can be really a pain."
good,"Turning point in my career."
good,"Always on the bleeding edge of technology, the business changes daily.  Always something new to learn.  Key focus changes often and you have to be able to change your focus with the business."
good,"Lots of autonomy, great co-workers, good boss.  Senior leadership of division focused on saying yes vs. making the best business decisions.  This makes for unnecessary chaos, at times.  The team works hard and meets the challenges head on."
good,"Microsoft was a great company to work for.   A team mentality was encouraged but personal improvement was stressed as any individual employee could have the solution to a problem."
good,"Worked as a vendor under MS project. Way too much of shift on project and didn't have a good direction."
good,"If you are putting the hours for only 1 job the pay and benefits are good. However, if you are putting in enough hours for 2 full time jobs then the pay stinks."
good,I enjoyed participating to the company transformation : Cloud first Mobile first. HR commitment into emerging countries is the same than any other G8 countries. Feel impactful with events and citizenship actions.
good,"Its a great place to work! "
good,"Productive and fun place with supportive management. Not all about numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big multinational company."
good,Company as a whole is a great place too work. Sometimes having the wrong person in a leadership position can make your job miserable since there is not great accountability for management. Other than that it is still a great place to work and offers great benefits.
good,"As a contingent worker you do not have a desk so you must always either work from home, coffee shops or the cafeteria. "
good,"Most managers stress work/life balance and want to see the people on their teams succeed on an individual as well as team level. When you work for one of them Microsoft is a great place to be.  Sadly there are still too many managers who are just interested in furthering their own careers and who are sometimes just incompetent, and their opinion of you can adversely affect your career for years.  Try to connect with people who work for the team you're interviewing with to get an honest assessment of what kind of manager you'll be working for."
good,It working good working with Microsoft and learn moretechnologies
good,"Depending on the role, you may have work life balance before Satya took over. Given recent reorgs and layoffs, nobody there can enjoy work life balance anymore"
good,"I had to work alongside 24-year old SDE's and PM's who would riding around on scooters and attend meetings all day. These guys made loads of money for barely any work. As a web analyst, I was making Seattle minimum wage. Despite this, I took the job thinking I'd find opportunities to learn about the technical side of things, or that there'd be room for advancement. Boy was I wrong. My team and I were expected to pump out numbers at an unsustainable rate, and if your numbers were lagging for more than a week, you'd be quietly taken aside and canned. On the plus side, the facilities were amazing, the food was great, and there were always nice little perks like free, quality office supplies and beverages."
good,I have spent most of my career at Microsoft. Job satisfaction greatly depends on your manager and group.
good,"Pro: Work with the latest technologies"
good,"My daily work has been great, as I've been allowed for some time (basically until now) to work mostly remotely from my house, meaning I have a very portable job. I know that this is rare among contractors, so this has been a great thing. Their facilities are second to none. I learned a lot about Windows and the inside culture of such a large company. Management has a lot of improve on, however. They tend to promote people into management who are better served not talking to people, but to computers. "
good,"good people -- you need to like ambiguity"
good,I was in a contract position and there were ZERO benefits. Great for a year or two to get experience but not for longer than that.
good,"My main focus is to help Corporate clients to being more successful and productive; not only by answering questions or having engaging conversations on phone, also by training them in how to use Microsoft products in the most efficient way."
good,The good:
good,"Working offsite has some disadvantages. The Washington state team is very ""about them""."
good,"Good pay and benefits, but its all talk and no walk when it comes to the culture they preach."
good,"Working with Microsoft, there's a new emphasis on teamwork and collaboration, rather than competition and glory grabbing."
good,"Microsoft is a great place to begin your career. You will learn a lot of useful technologies, as well as interacting with managers and team mates in a relatively relaxed environment (under no pressure)."
good,Colleagues are very respectful of one another. Pay rate was above average. Supervisor provided everything needed to finish the job without having to ask for guidence.
good,"not an FTE; therefor I don't have good perspective; work at Microsoft is generally dependent upon which group and your manager; as part of a group that interacted with the security subsection of the OS group, I felt like I was contributing to the overall profitability of Microsoft, just wish it would have continued"
good,Microsoft is fun place to work at. There is opportunity to learn and grow all the times. There is enough diversity for anyone to fit in easily. Overall great place for work.
good,Great place to work and comfortable workspace to go to on a daily basis. Made good use of my skills and background while being flexible to my schedule and availability.
good,Typical day was 8 hours with good work life balance. Managers strived and pushed for your success. Tech leads under managers were knowledgeable but shouldn't have been in any team leadership role.
good,"Whiles it's great to get your foot in the door at one of the most significant companies in the world, if your ambitions are moving up the corporate ladder, you are better off getting some experience with a Microsoft certified partner, and apply to a core job right awat."
good,"At Microsoft i had many typical days at work.  What I learned is what I learned.  We had management that managed.  At Microsoft we had a workplace culture.  The hardest part of the job was the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was going home each day, and not staying there."
good,They did well to bring me in to single-handedly handle all VBA migration issue = 400 count for large bank migration to O365.  This was part of a Microsoft migration team; others concentrated on Outlook.
good,It was great. I came in to do a job. Worked along intelligent peers and got the job done. I'm filling this area with basic text as to meet the minimum requirement of text.
good,"Good place to learn constantly. I learned self paced work style and to deliver on time. "
good,"It was very good experience working with the Microsoft."
good,I worked on fun projects and terrible projects. Your experience may vary. Way too much time spent in meetings and non-productive events. Not enough time spent on doing quality work.
good,"This was a fun job but not worth the headache. Depends on store, but at the end of the day its retail and you will experience everything that comes with ""retail"". In the beginning everything went smooth, people were nice, management acted like they cared. Fast forward 4 months into my role, I saw peoples true colors for who they really were. When it came to the culture, management did not practice what they preached. I looked at management as a whole, but there were some individuals that were worse than others.Get rid of management, that store needs a major face lift!!"
good,"fingers are crossed and hoping for the best. the passion doesn't  stop from doing the desire that to achieve the target and i know this will be fruitful for me. "
good,I worked in MS Asia-Pacific Group. The employees have flexible schedules and lots of time for personal projects. The location is the best in Beijing where it's easy to access anything you need.
good,Dynamic environment. Interesting colleagues. Continuously evolving and growing set of opportunities and challenges. Very aggressive targets and continuous efforts for improvement.
good,"When working at Microsoft, you experience will largely be contingent on what team you join. Besides the general product, you might end up a variety of teams, which will ultimately color your experience. I was apart of Windows, where some of the legacy parts of the culture have remained."
good,"As per my work experience, I have learned lots of things here to grow professional and social too. Management is nice and helpful and workplace culture is too friendly."
good,La empresa es muy amena con sus trabajadores y los premia
good,Working at Microsoft was a lot of fun! I was able to branch out to other teams and work with them making a lot of new friends. Campus is beautiful. The was a lot events open to everyone to join
good,"Productive, fast-paced, diverse workplace culture, sometimes stressful, customer service oriented, dependable work, ongoing training, temporary assignment"
good,I felt everything moved very slowly there. I was only there a short period of time and the background check took very long to finally give me the okay to get my badge.
good,My position with Microsoft was temporary. This made keeping this job impossible as it was contract work. Overall they were dedicated to the mental health of their employees and took steps to create breaks and allow employees to get to know one another in an otherwise isolating atmosphere.
good,"Learned a ton while working for them. Came in with very little knowledge, and left with multiple years worth of knowledge in a much less amount of time."
good,I really enjoyed my time at Microsoft.  Its a fast paced and creative place that you can drive your career in.  Unfortunately it is a move up or move out company that doesn't have a lot of room at the top and some of the management in the middle levels is dead wood that could go. They can rob from peter to pay paul by stealing heads from a department to add head count to another for an end of year push.  This causes frequent RIFs
good,It's nice working with the Microsoft. I have learned many things with a nice friendly workplace. The hardest part of the job is the complexity if the code base.
good,"Microsoft was great. It taught me good software development and product management  skills while working in a fast-paced, stressful environment. The best part was just going into work having fun with what I do while also getting to meet new people."
good,"Very relaxed but focused work environment.  Perhaps the best I've worked in.  Team environment oriented - if you don't know the answer or cannot locate it, it is encouraged to collaborate with your coworkers."
good,"-Compensation and Benefits "
good,"With the incredibly large and diverse amount of jobs at Microsoft, any one review is going to paint a pretty small picture of the whole company.  Your success at Microsoft, while largely up to you, is also VERY much bound to the group you're working in.  For example, the Windows group periodically turns into a dumpster fire where it must certainly be the worst place on Earth to work.  Layoff's, lack of promotions, terrible work-life balance, etc... then the re-org comes, people get jumbled around, new people get hired and things stabilize for a year or two.  Then decay starts and the process repeats.  I've had 20 years to observe the cyclical nature of hire & fire at Microsoft, and there was also a time when I myself subscribed to 70 hour work week...but I wasn't rewarded for that additional effort, and in those 20 years I can honestly say that it's entirely up to you to manage your work-life balance, and pull yourself out of unsavory situations.  There's so many groups to work in at Microsoft that it can be detrimental to your soul and your career to stay parked in once place too long.  15 years in Windows was about 13 years too long, and I definitely have regrets.  The benefits have gone down-hill over the years, some of that was courtesy of ObamaCare.  Prior to Obama, Microsoft's Healthcare was absolutely top-notch.  Now, it's good but not anywhere near as great as it once was.  Same for the company store benefits... they used to be spectacular, now they're mediocre.  I often find better deals for Microsoft software and hardware by searching for them outside of Microsoft"
good,"Microsoft has many positive attributes, although my history there was somewhat limited. I would absolutely consider re-employment if security and culture could be more clearly defined."
good,Nothing earth-shattering that is not known and openly discussed already. A huge company which has the usual advantages and disadvatages. Would work there again.
good,The team I worked in requires a lot of working over the weekend and sometimes weekday evenings. I need to participate in daily standup meetings and create a wide range of reports within tight time frame.
good,People were great. I am always easy going. They had a great break room with free coffee and a nice plasma tv. Definitely an easy job to do. I would recommend.
good,Microsoft as a company has a good work life balance. Only problem is that contract employees can find it hard to become FTE. Working environment and pay are at par with other companies
good,I have little to say here.  The environment was stressful but manageable.  I enjoyed the teams I was part of and enjoyed moving them to success toward required/expected results
good,"Microsoft is full of intelligent, hard-working, amazing people. Some of them are able to reach their full potential, others are not, mostly due to improper management and/or HR policies. Satya has done wonderful things for the company, but some relics of the Ballmer era still continue in mid-to-high level leadership roles."
good,"Microsoft is a fabulous place to work.  It is huge so it takes an individual's dedicated commitment to advancing their career - it won't just happen.  That said, if a person is determined their options are limitless at Microsoft."
good,"Complicated processes, too many cooks in the room. Every org has its own culture so there is no precise conclusion. But you can definitely meet smart people here."
good,"Day to day can get busy and cluttered with all the meetings we have. However, I still was able to get all my work done in a timely manner. Loved working here."
good,"- Good company but depends on team and team leader"
good,"If you're lucky enough to land on a team with a good manager, Microsoft will be one of the best places you've ever worked.  If you land with a bad manager, and there are plenty of individual contributors who should never have been promoted into management, you're next move is to get out."
good,"A classic Fortune 500 company with it's ups and downs. Great CEO, smart people, a certain amount of politics that makes getting good design work done challenging. It's all about the team you get as to how satisfying your time is there."
good,I worked with a team of developers and testers. Typically I would assess the upcoming releases based on the planning done and then create a release train along with other development and test team members. The most enjoyable part of the work is to work with most brilliant engineers from the world.
good,"Microsoft is an equal opportunity employer.Productive and funplace to work. place to learn new things, the most enjoyable part of the job. good work culture"
good,"such a great environment easy office life, can work from home, tech growth mindset, international one of the biggest companies. diversity and inclusion"
good,good and was a great place to work. Enjoyed the team work and wonderful learning experience. so much fun i enoyed every minute and it w goood tank you tfo
good,"I am not providing a review. My position at the company makes it inappropriate to do so. The people I worked with were mostly good, and at times not. That is all I can provide."
good,Entreprise avec un environnement agréable ou il est appréciable de travailler en synergie avec des divisions différentes.
good,Microsoft is a great place to work if you thrive in ambiguity and are comfortable with mediocre managers.  The company seems to change strategy and tactics frequently resulting in major layoffs affecting many people.
good,Good to work here. Learnt cloud technologies. Good team to support challenges at work. good work life balance In the project. New things can be encouraged in the project.
good,"While you are working, the job is great, I've worked for Microsoft 3 times, but each time was met with random layoffs.  During one of my contracts, they did an evaluation every two weeks.  I received a perfect score for every evaluation and was told my position was secure.  A week after my last evaluation I was let go without notice.  They did give me a 2-week severance package, but it certainly was a kick in the teeth.  Previous times at Microsoft, they at least had the decency to give us a month-long heads up."
good,"Like titles says, great company with great projects, just a few bad apples in between that tend to ruin it for a good chunk of people who actually want to do good in this world"
good,"Buen lugar para aprender sobre el mundo corporativo. "
good,enjoyed working with various ethnic backgrounds and strongly talented folks. team.  players that loved providing positive feedback.  Microsoft is truly one that gives back to the community.
good,"The mission has changed since my time at Microsoft, with a new CEO and direction. I appreciated working with very smart colleagues, and the company makes an effort to retain its talent."
good,"I enjoyed working there, the training could be better but they're are rings of additional resources to learn from.  Headcount is always their reason not converting contractors."
good,I had the opportunity to learn new things. Work pressure is definetely on the higher side. Expectations are also too high. Lot of opportunities for challenging projects.
good,It's important that we feel encouraged to contribute to their unique insight and skills to help solve some of the most complex technology challenges. We were supporting seven major employee groups and over 40 employee networks that help us build a supportive community across Microsoft.
good,"Beatiful campus with nice buildings, offices and subsidized meals and drinks do not balance with long hours, tons of pressure and lack of leadership in the middle of the org chart."
good,"I was given ample opportunity to grow and learn. Scaling was factored into every design decision we were asked to make, and we were tasked to evangelize the direction we would choose."
good,"If you learn your responsabilites fast, company can be flexible with your working hours. But management can improved. Its a bing copany so I'm sure not all management is the same."
good,"Aprendes a realizar charlas, dar cursos, hacer amigos y tener contacto directo con las ultimas tecnologías impartidas por Microsoft."
good,I worked as an Intern however it was a great place to learn and grow. I was taught a lot and could see myself working for the company until retirement.
good,"Great opportunities for growth and learning in the job. "
good,"Great and structured workplace with a nice working atmosphere and great career opportunities.Being part of fast-paced environment at Microsoft especially during peak times like FY Q-end, meant I frequently had to work against strict deadlines."
good,"Great place to learn and work with new things, but advancement is/ can be difficult.  Expected to be able to know what has to happen, and idea's are not always followed."
good,"Microsoft is a good company to work for, Get to travel if you are open for it, great place to start if you are looking to get into technology and learning about computers, hardware and software."
good,"Great team, great experience. Bad team, bad experience. Just like any job. It's a large company so you are required to be a specialist, not a generalist."
good,"If you are in a good team, your experience will be great. If you are in a bad team, it will be bad big time. The bad teams are where management makes very frequent changes in its mission, or structure and causes team reorgs that affect the morale of the team members."
good,I am not going to give information on Microsoft.  I worked there 4.5 years and left.  I would say the fact that I left says something.  I will leave it up to you to figure it out.
good,I worked on a busy project connected to the private sector.  I supported a team of executives and project managers.  The workplace culture was relaxed but the work was intense.
good,"The people at work are great, easy going and hard working individuals. Unfortunately, the company is adapting to a changing industry by displacing employees and not offering much of an opportunity for advancement."
good,"Microsoft is a good company.  The people are the best.  the products are good, but management needs to understand, people are not computers.  you can't micromanage people like computer programs, tweeking them, and discarding them as defective parts."
good,Organizational changes have caused some disturbances with this group but this should get sorted out soon and once it does the team should be back to optimal performance.
good,"Had a good experience with this agency largely because of the competency of the recruiter I worked with.  "
good,"I worked for Microsoft as a contractor, employed by Lionbridge between the years 2010 and February 2014, so the direct employee expreience does not apply to me. "
good,"A good place to work for people a new employee to learn international standards,Every day was a challenging day with the global clients. Friendly management with well mannered culture."
good,Microsoft is a fun place to work for while delivering products which are used by a large customer base. The diversity of roles and products provides you an opportunity to have a challenging long term career.
good,"There is not a typical day at Microsoft; always moving, producing and moving. I enjoyed the people, the culture and the opportunity. The only frustrating thing is the benefits (as a consultant) are not very competitive."
good,Professional and supportive work environment.  Currently going through many changes as the vision of Satya and new management is realized which has destabilized the environment.  I believe they will come out stronger in the end.
good,"Overall, I thought that my internship was a good experience getting myself through work life. It was a roller coaster at times going from fast paced to snails pace."
good,"Working as a research assistant for a new project at Microsoft. The team has 10+ members, and the management team handles the project well.The overall work schedule is closely monitored, but have flexibility as to accomplishing the weekly goal."
good,Nice place to work. Often had to work many more that 8 hours daily and manager was often doing personal things. Given jobs that were to be for the manager .
good,It is a retail position so you should already know what you are getting yourself into. But this place will give you a chance to grow with in the company and quickly
good,"Its a very good place for working,with a very pleasent environment. and team which i worked with are good at knowledge sharing,which helped me a lot to improve myself."
good,"Long days, complicated matrix environment. High priced! I worked for Microsoft for 4 years.  Difficult to put a solution in from of customers, because of the overhead of reviews."
good,"Support staff and management are very supportive and accommodating to work with. Working environment is great, account manager actively work with company to find suitable positions for you."
good,"Good company to work for."
good,"Inside sales team was a very fun and exciting place to work."
good,"Very much felt like this was a firm in transition as it grapples with systems built to deliver boxed software and translated that to the cloud. Quite a bit of empire building here, but still opportunities to do good work."
good,"He said unemployment was high, farmers were helpless, education was expensive and medical costs were soaring because the government had not set up new hospitals, corruption was very high and a handful of industrialists and corporates could take away land, water and other resources while the BJP government in the State remained a mute spectator."
good,"The people and management were very knowledgeable and willing to teach and explain things, even though I was a contractor.  The pace was fairly laid back but very focused."
good,"Global accounts first point of contact"
good,"Fun at work. I have been working here for the past 5 years."
good,"One of the best places to work for with great work life balance. Work with the smartest people in the field, on the toughest customers, driving impact on a scale never before in my realm of possibilities. It is extremely challenging, and rewarding work"
good,"Fun,fast environment with amazing facilities and opportunities to progress. Great people to work with. Chance to see all the latest technologies and applications before launch."
good,"It's not that what you do is not important. It's not that what you do is on a strict time schedule and that someone will die if you don't get it to it today. It's that there is not enough support staff and they expect an executive assistant/business administrator to support and do the job of 3+ people at any given time. On top of that, after the reorg, they made a group of centralized administrative assistants to help with the workload and then a couple of months later they got rid of them and are hiring cheaper vendor admins for half the price of the full time employees they had. They don't value admins at Microsoft. All the talk from Satya about how people are valued at Microsoft only pertains to the bread winners like sales people."
good,Great place to work - but you have to be in the right team and seek impactful roles. Managers are hugely variable resulting in inconsistent employee investment and growth potential. Excellent benefits and employee perks.
good,"Really hard and fast paced, great ,management, left for a wider role and more global coverage. Workplace culture is still evolving but headed in the right direction. Hardest part of the job was the lack of resources however the best part was the interaction and developing of products between clients and engineering"
good,Campus was a world class facility with labs built to industry standards. Benefits were very good. Cafeteria had employee discounts with good food. Parties were held on a weekly basis to allow employees time to relax.
good,"Its a Very Sales Oriented Organisation , with an Open Culture and the empowerment to take decisions and work in a team setup. It helps give a global perspective ."
good,"As with most contracting gigs, your pay will be low, but people treated me well there.  I have no complaints to mention.  I only worked there for a relatively short time"
good,"All in all, Microsoft is a good place to work.  Every team has it's issues and different organizations are like different companies, but with common workings."
good,"A good experience and a good amount of learning with high visibility. Although high demands and stressful at times, was a good experience. Long hours during busy timelines within the group."
good,"good jobs, great benefits. Enjoy working there but looking for new challenges and opportunities. Can recommend to anyone working at Microsoft. Great corporate culture."
good,Microsoft was a fun place to work on enterprise software and web site/services development.  I especially enjoyed selecting a technology and having virtually unlimited resources to learn the space.
good,Grande structure et une organisation changeante continuellement
good,Great place to work at in terms of location and company culture! They treat the workers with respect and are very flexible with hours. It is a great stop to be at!
good,worked in the maintenance of the data and files for an internal program that is fast growing. The culture is very tech feel which is obvious but more conservative and not a throw the brand into your face. They know who they are and are not trying to prove anything. there is a combination of older and younger people but definitely the older people dominate.
good,"One of the best places to work in India. Be it the quality of work or the work-life balance, benefits - everything is good."
good,"Les journées étaient intense, exigeante, mais l'équipe étaient jeune, dynamique et convivial."
good,"Fast moving division, world travel independent work environment.  No expense spared travel.  Interesting speakers and a great office.  Casual but hardworking atmosphere"
good,"The work is enjoyable and challenging, however the culture is very divisive and all teams are out for themselves. For example, it's extremely hard to get engineers to fix tools, because they have their own agenda and projects to complete for their yearly and quarterly reviews. FTE's won't even so much as make eye contact with contractors or vendors if they pass you in the hall, which creates an awkward environment when they have to work with each other. Management skills are few and far between, with most decisions being made on the fly and plenty of people left out of the loop."
good,Good company but going through massive changes.  Sets quota unrealistically so only about 30 percent of reps make their number any given year. Sales management rides you like a rented mule leading to turnover.
good,"Microsoft if a great company, that has successful pushed for a cultural change. It has definitely taken hold and you can tell people are really buying in."
good,"Continuous innovation.  Great team.  Fun place to work with excellent benefits.  The new CEO is great, and his and his leadership team efforts are making a big positive difference"
good,"Coming out from a Monoply frame, Microsoft is learning how to compete in the open market."
good,"It is a good place to work when you find the right team, able to achieve work/life balance, working with smart people and people who are passionate about their work."
good,I learned quite a bit about load balancing and networking.  It was a good job that paid well but I would have like a blue badge.  Nice people (for the most part).
good,"Learned a lot and was able to work on new technologies like Azure.  Great experience lots of opportunities.  Allowed, to think out side the box and create new ways to complete work meaning self managed."
good,"Over the course of about 10 years I had the privilege to work on about 10 different projects, all of which I found interesting and career fulfilling. Most of the people with whom I worked were open minded, technically savvy and enthusiastic about my participation. This I found to be the most valuable aspect about working there, and I felt contributed to project and product success."
good,"At Microsoft, the energy level was high and very infectious. Had the opportunity to work with a group of ambitious and highly motivated individuals. "
good,Lots to do but great environment makes it enjoyable very high energy environment.It's a retail job so there are typical retail environment nuances but the Microsoft way helps makes that easier.
good,"Hard to get into the FTE club. Not great for artists. Corporate-y, but there are free beverages and no strict dress code. It was the right step for me and my career, but working as a vendor does not guarantee you a full time job."
good,The senior leadership team at Microsoft Surface has a good product vision and has established good organization values.  Full of smart and hard working team members who really pushed the envelope to achieve the product vision.  Deep technical development opportunities with great resources.
good,"Microsoft is a good place to work. There are lots of opportunities to grow your career across disciplines from Marketing, Engineering, Finance and IT."
good,"If you love tech, this is a great place. No doubt you'll talk tech (mostly the MSFT stack) from enterprise to consumer."
good,"Overall, I think Microsoft is a good company to work for. There are lots of old-timers who have worked there for years. If you happen to join team with a few of such people, then it might not be a good situation. They would support each other almost unconditionally. Microsoft used to have rigid performance review system, so the survived people should either be technically strong, or have good people skills."
good,"No company has the breadth and depth of software offered by Microsoft."
good,"This review is based on a typical contractor experience, which is not even close to FTE. Had a great time learning and figuring out challenges/achieving goals with a management while difficult at times, was still was accommodating. Work/life balance was not great, as the employees are pushed to succeed, however this is typical of Silicon Valley. Great to be surrounded with many intelligent and smart people. Pay was horrible but merely because of too many consulting companies wanting to be the second middleman. Microsoft is a great company and they are on the up and up."
good,"Interesting technology shows the need and importance of business data access worldwide. Escalation hierarchy,at the time, was lacking along with dissemination of tools useful for the support role."
good,"What can you say?  It's Microsoft.  Your primary job is not what you will be graded on.  There will always be people looking to run faster than you, if not faster than the bear."
good,Microsoft allows workers to work hard and be a part of the project resulting in buy in from all levels.  Work hard and make a difference.  Creates a buzz of hard workers but worth it.

good,"It is a very fun and a very challenging environment. "
good,"Good company, well colugos, nice place to work, well in all projects and good place to work in all fields,"
good,Productive environment.  Opportunity to learn various technologies.  Good for self starters and people needing little supervision.
good,"Microsoft is a very good company to work for in terms of gaining experience and having a decent opportunity to advance in career.  Certain pockets are more progressive than others when taking a risk on an unknown quantity.  Certain pockets have more healthy culture than others.  There is little work-life balance yet excellent benefits and the relative security of a steady paycheck.  Due to the high level of change internally (vision, management, employee turn-over etc.) it can be difficult feeling like you're always on the verge or in the middle of getting to know a new team or manager because of all the re-organization that seems to be the one constant."
good,"I was senior sales supervisor so I have to manage sales targets and making strategies."
good,"During my time as an intern I was provided all of the tools and support I needed to gain more knowledge and experience. I learned how to write an FSD, create and deliver presentations to management to explain the value of my work and the necessary technical skills to complete my project."
good,Lots of room for growth. Need to be a self started and look for opportunities. Company culture is coming back and morale is much higher now. Future looking very bright.

good,Microsoft is a great company is a big Corporate Software Company.  I've enjoyed working there for 18 years.  Ask me more sometime soon.
good,Management excellence is not consistent and can vary greatly across teams. Company needs to advance its commitment to diversity and inclusion of all groups.
good,"Microsoft continues to reshape the way we work and live. As an employer, they take care of their employees, though I will say compensation isn't quite as competitive as other big tech companies. Overall, I've been pleased with my time at Microsoft."
good,"Finding the right team and the right manager is key to success at Microsoft.  The work environment is collaborative, the variety is good and the freedom to work the way you want to work is great.  No structured hours are required which allows you the freedom to get things done from home and work!"

good,"I had the opportunity to interface with many smart people working on the latest in NLP, Search Algorithms, Machine Learning, and improving overall search relevancy. The facilities were nice and I had the luxury of working from anywhere. I felt sometimes that progress was slow due to bureaucracy. The hardest part was the late night hours because of having to work with overseas teams. I enjoyed more than anything interacting with people."
good,I worked as a vendor here. It is a great place to learn new technologies and keep yourself at par with the market. Work culture is cool and flexible.
good,"Required a daily review of tickets that included the deployment, installation and maintenance of over 50,000 servers in one of the world's largest data centers"

good,"I always liked to work in Microsoft Corporation in a corporate culture. It is a fun place to work, and learn new software. It is always challenging. It is good to meet new people from different cultures, and also to learn good things about them."
good,"Microsoft is a great place to work.  Productive and fun.  My only complaint is their lengthy history of failing in some sectors, such as Bing, Windows, Windows Phone and Surface.  Hopefully their massive restructuring efforts and new leadership at the top will offer the recipe this company needs to win and rise to the top."
good,"Work starts at 1300 and ends at 23:30 four days week 4 on and 3 off."

good,"Ambiente molto stimolante, con grandi prospettive di crescita professionale ma d'altro canto molto stressante e impegnativo."

good,"Great company to work for. "
good,"Every day is different, new opportunities for being flexible and adaptable. Somewhat aggressive versus assertive, collaboration is a buzzword as opposed to being actually practiced. Veterans tend to hold to past styles of engagement and could be more open to diverse points of view."
good,"Many challenge projects had been done there."
good,"There is an atmosphere that promotes making friends in the office. However, working at home is permitted when it does not interfere with normal business."
good,"Working at Microsoft was nice. I learned some good computer skills and how to process returns and reship orders. I also learned how to troubleshoot Windows 8 operating system. Management was nice, but they didn't always keep you in the loop because we were only temps. My co-workers were fun and enjoyable to be around. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to help the angry customers and come up with solutions so they would be happy customers by the end of the phone call."
good,I enjoyed working for a company that built innovative products and provided its employees with the best available resources.
good,"Main duties were assisting in carry out the product marketing campaigns."
good,Working at Microsoft is a great experience. You feel excited to o to work everyday. You learn a lot on the job and know about the upcoming technology at the earliest.
good,"I worked as part of a new team within office. The people I worked with were all friendly but there was a huge sense of pressure to meet deadlines, and daily feature meetings (as part of the switch to a more agile approach) meant your PM was always expecting a clear accounting of what was done and what was going to be done that day. This can be stressful for a programmer. However, the work was exactly what it should be and the pay was great so all in all a good experience."
good,"Lack of competitive drive, product design tend to overcomplicate things, very difficult to explore other roles inside the company, lack of risk taking culture."

good,A normal work day includes setting controle and scouting as you work. Your constently learning how to see the different terrain and know where you point needs to be set or collected. Management is always explaing the projects and geving vital information to allow us o get the job done. My coworkers are verry friendly and all ways willing to teach and help with any question I or any other young employee may have. The hardest part of the job is fully understanding the job and knowing what is the best way to exicute with so many eliments going at one time. What makes the job enjoyable is the job its self working with one other person and getting the jobs done is what makes it great.
good,"De vraies responsabilités m'ont été confiées très rapidement, même en temps que stagiaire ce qui est très appréciable."
good,"I manage calendars for a VP, GM and Sr Director, book international travel, put together weekly bullet points from the team, order supplies for the team, order catering for meetings, book conf rooms.  the hardest part of the job is that it isn't challenging enough and their isn't enough work to keep busy.  did learn to manage budget which is a great skill to have."
good,Nice place to work. nice environment. Good place for career hikes. b
good,"Microsoft was a fabulous company to work for during the high growth periods.  Ideal for a work hard/play hard person and the total compensation and benefits were awesome.  The company is in a transition/re-invent period currently.  Seems corporate direction and strategy is going in the right direction but re-orgs and manager changes can slow personal growth. Legacy has often limited ability to innovate.  Its a great opportunity to get large, global corporate experience."
good,Microsoft has taught me skills that will carry with me through out the rest of my life. They've taught me how to work in a corporate environment. I've learn the tools to be a great administrate assistant. Working in the legal department has been a great experience.

Product Advisers' responsibilities include selling computers and accessories. They also become involved in learning the various Microsoft Office suite and then teach it to customers who sign up for Personal Training. They also help with setting up marketing and other elements of the store."
good,"Every day there is a new challenge to over come. We deal with customer that have high demands and expect a lot for Microsoft. I am able to manage data, communicate well with customers and I am to work with a team."
good,"The pace is fast and highly demanding, though exciting and motivating at the same time. Great organization to join if you like to tackle big challenges. The scope of the types of projects you get to work on are unique given Microsoft's size. It's a highly matrixed organization, learning how to get things done is critical. Work life balance tend to be an issue for many employees, though the company offers perks that help balance that out somewhat. It's also a place where you will either fit or not fit into the culture."
good,Assistant Administrator (Contract Position)
good,I have had a great career here at MS. As assistants you wear many hats and always have variety in your job. I have learned so many more skills than when I came here.
good,"I liked this job because I wasnt standing on my feet all day , I could go wherever I wanted in the warehoue."
good,"Had a pleasant experience, interacted with knowledgable people and learned the culture and the trade. Hardest part was to always be considered as an outsider and never taken for a full time employee position. Typical day at work will include some conferences, many emailing, work and update on reports and following up on clients or requests."

good,"Even though they teach you that you should be in a culture of ""Each one, Teach one"", they only give you a 3 strike policy; However there were a number of individuals let go after 1.  If you make 3 formally written up mistakes, I was told that management is required to fire you.  Even if the mistake is big or small, it is frustrating that the management team did no counseling or overseeing to help assist or prevent the same mistakes from occurring in yourself or others.  "
good,"Fast paced environment, driven culture.  Very challenging and rewarding work.  Lots of opportunities to change career directions.  Good pay and benefits."
good,"Excellent Benefits but stressful work environment. If you are looking for a sales ""team"" environment, this may not be the company for you. You are on your own. Still an excellent company to work for, just not the sort of environment for everyone. Lot's of sales department turnover."
good,"Working in Microsoft retail is filled with continual learning and a growth mentality in a high pressure and collaborative team environment. Premier sales as well as career development are what they aim for in their culture of ""empowering everyone""."
good,I am working on realince degital there is staff not good manners and bcz I have left my job olny for the reason of store staff issue other wise I was continue that company Microsoft is good company
good,"Good culture, with work from anywhere culture we can work from home as well as from remote for any emergence, company has multiple events where we can participate and learn and grow. "
good,"This was a contract position where I completed the work early and eliminated the potential for extension.  I would have really loved to continue contracting, but due to Microsoft's internal policies, I am currently unable to receive a new contract.  The most ideal outcome would have given me the opportunity to work my way into an FTE position, but alas, I have not yet broken through the firewall that is their resume evaluation process."
good,"This is a good company o work for, but as a contractor, it is almost impossible to get converted into an FTE. It is a great resume booster & they give you the opportunity to learn about the company."
good,Microsoft is productive by the sense it always welcomes ne ideas. It very relaxed since there is no existential pressure anyone. It is very mission oriented to how it only requires the best of everyone.
good,"Overall Microsoft's benefits are very good compared to other companies in the industry. "
good,Microsoft has the best productivity products which helps the customer increase performance. Microsoft as the best licensing model which needs to be explained to customers by the team.
good,"Great place to start your IT career. Depending on the team you work on and location, you may run into issues with career advancement unless willing to relocate, and work life balance issues."
good,"Jeder ist Manager bei MS, das wird auch so gelebt: wie man ein Ziel erreicht ist relativ nebensächlich, wichtig ist va, daß man es erreicht. Dadurch finden sich viele kleine Unternehmer in der Firma, die relativ frei vor sich hinwuseln. Das macht Spaß und gibt einem viele Freiheiten. Die Aufgaben sind anspruchsvoll und das Arbeitsleben ist unterhaltsam. Man sollte natürlich auch ein wenig auf den US Style stehen und sehr gut Englisch sprechen, das macht vieles leichter."
good,I learned how to interact and deal with people when I used to work here. This job I could say really helped with my shyness. Learned how to be helpful
good,"Microsoft as a company is a great place to work for hands down. My Experience working in the retail store not so much. Management isn’t too concerned with career advancement, the GM is hardly ever in the store. 90% of the staff including management had issues with the GM. You can’t be too Ambitious, that location will get you nowhere. And management will play roles, and can’t be trusted."
good,"Great team, good cooperation, bit too much travel at times"
good,Senior leadership has great messaging and direction but middle management perpetuates bureaucracy and old mindset decelerates newer hires' ambitions and ability to be change agents.
good,"Microsoft is a great company to work for, but in Buffalo, the only way to work for them is to work retail. This is a great way to get into the company, but it leaves someone who has a family and family obligations in a predicament because the only way to advance in the company is to move out of state. The hours are retail hours, which aren't conducive to raising a family as a single parent. The staff is primarily under the age of 35, and the few who are older than that kind of get pushed back into the flow. I feel advancement is only something for the young at Microsoft, which is sad, because 40-somethings have a lot to offer too."
good,Love working for Microsoft great company and amazing benefits. They truly know how to work around personal life and work life. Also they make you feel like you are part of a family.
good,"the benefits are the best part about the job. Free surface, great health and dental plan, and the people are pretty cool too. It will be hard to get an advancement though."
good,It was fun working with my team. The day usually start with standup meeting which helps If anyone has any issue in there task. The management is good.
good,"Other company may take a month to develop a feature or port an external module. here manager may ask you to deliver it in a week."
good,"It was a factory job, and the managers were vary helpful and supportive. The clean rooms that I worked on where vary ordinarily, and my peers where also helpful."
good,Clients were excellent to work with and were very customer centric. The HR function underwent organizational change and lost some focus on client engagement as it relates to business results.
good,"It's a great place to work with, lots of benefits and perks as well! Would have been better if everyone is really cooperating with team based projects"
good,I loved working here. I was able to work remotely and felt like I was given the support I needed. The only thing I would complain about is the fact there was no job stability.  People were being let go often.
good,huge company with good and bad. lots of opportunity but it is redmod based primarily unless you want to work in the field which has limited my growth when I moved back to texas. company is transforming with lots of old and new cultures -- needs more work on figuring out how to work with millennial and younger
good,"A typical retail shift consists of being zoned at different spots throughout the store and greeting customers as well as selling them the Microsoft Experience: the Surface family, XBOX, and VR and occasionally teaching a group of kids abut robotics."
good,"Workplace culture is very casual and co-workers are friendly. I like my job, I think it has been a challenge to get promoted and move up. But, overall, a good work environment."
good,"Customer focused, collaborative work environment that is forward thinking and energetic. Driven to do what is right for the customer, although not always most efficient as multiple teams can build similar solutions."
good,"MSFT is a great company for those that want to stay within their primary role, but for those that want to make an impact or work cross-functionally, it can be a challenge and frustrating.   However, MSFT does allow for career growth for those that want to advance their skills."
good,"Great place if retail is your thing.         "
good,"Microsoft is a large company with many diversified business units and opportunities to explore.  It is relatively easy to switch discipline or career track if you are able to make the right contact."
good,"I learned a lot from this job and took on a lot of roles to help with development. When going for a job you love you need to be a manager or a certain ""work level"" in order to receive an interview. This is such a horrible and hurtful experience. Knowing you are qualified for the role you applied for but, since you do not have a specific title you will not receive a chance to prove yourself."
good,"Microsoft is a great employer and everyone should take the opportunity if you should be so fortunate. I was in a travel poistion that was very consuming and eventually led to my departure. If you are able to work in hte HQ offices this would make travel less frequent and your role would require a driven individual that is up to the challenge of surviving the ever changing organization. I had 3 managers in 4 years, 3 of which were in my last 2 years of employment. Seemingly a big process engine that you have to want to grow with or get out of."
good,"Excelente company, top people and products."
good,"Nice to work there. They provide best technologies and training to enhance skills and implement ideas."
good,Lot's of politics. Executive leadership out of touch with vertical middle management bloat. aka. too many cooks in the kitchen to get stuff done. Empowerment is preached but not actually put into action.
good,"Worked on a variety of contracts for a variety of different industries."
good,"Great company to work for, training development and kpi of high calibre. Enjoyed the company culture. Contract workers remuneration is minuscule as compared to permenant stuff."
good,Fast paced environment with plenty of variety to keep a person interested and energized to deliver on their objectives each day.  Working toward shifting workplace culture to maximize effectiveness and address concerns about worklife balance.
good,"Over the past few years most of the original Microsoftees have all gone and finally left the company.  With the major shift to the cloud, the company has been completely focused on their cloud offerings from a technical perspective, but also from a monetary and licensing perspective.  That pressure has come down hard on the various field teams and especially sales.  The turnover rate has dramatically increased and it's sad to see so many people leave the company because of their own volition or they were forced out.  It used to be a great place to work and maybe in some areas it still is, however the sales areas are not near as good as they used to be for potential employees."
good,"It has as any other companies very good things like flexible schedule, possibility of working from home, the team is very collaborative. Don't like the openness of the work spaces because you get distracted."
good,"It has been a great experience with great managers. There is a learn by taking in as much info as you can right out of the gate. But once you adjust to the work it was very manageable and I, as a contractor, was able to work from home. The managers in last position would respond quickly to questions, give advice or give extra projects in order to help growth. The downside is that, as a contractor, I had a limit of time before I would have to leave, if it was possible to keep rolling from contract to contract I would but having to take 6 months off before I am allowed to take a new contract is highly stressful and makes me look to other companies to reach my career goals."
good,"Microsoft provided a great opportunity to grow and expand my career.  Training is available in class and on demand, benefits are some of the best in the industry and compensation is solid.   They are changing their business and shifting to a much younger workforce."
good,"Microsoft was a great place to work.  I was a contractor (as are 50% of their workforce), and as such pay was significantly lower than those employed directly by Microsoft.  The work environment was great and staff and management all great to work with.  I had the pleasure of serving under 2 great bosses there.  It was an interesting job and I did enjoy it.  However, vendors were definitely treated differently than MS FTEs, in that we weren't allowed to participate in morale events, and we were identified and singled out as vendors with a ""V-"" in front of our email addresses."
good,I really enjoy my job. I was able to help customers with technical support concerns about his or her xbox game system. The information and training was great.
good,Loved the benefits and the additional education that they always provided me to help me develop my skills within my role. Really enjoyed my time working for Microsoft.
good,carreira e possibilidade de crescimento durante o período de trainee.
good,I worked as production intern on live production sets. Great experience working on 2-3 different shoots each week. Gave me broad exposure to all aspects of the corperate marketing world.
good,"This was a temporary contract position at the old Bing office."
good,"Loved it here with some exception.  It really all depends on what organization you work for and if you and your manager get along and more importantly, if you love your job.  Some reviews I've seen about MS are mixed and at the end of the day its all a matter of perspective."
good,"It was a very fast paced work environment with working under pressure. Attention to detail, organisation and timely manner were excepted. I was training new Microsoft employees on set up of their equipment and providing them with everything they needed e.g. logins, authorisations, technical errors to be fixed with help of technical engineers, provided cables,booked stock orders etc."
good,Great culture - work hard play hard mentality.  Management isn't very strong - they are unaware of larger hollistic organization & can't necessarily provide proper direction.
good,"Many great managers"
good,"this was a good place to work, friendly team and very collaborative. I worked on a Mac which was a plus. I had great feedback from my team and management."
good,"My work was never dull.  There were very high expectations on performance, so I worked hard to keep myself in good standing.  I was doing contract work, so the drawback of that arrangement is that you can never count on any contract will last its promised duration.  Conditions can change and your services may no longer be needed.  It's important to have a good relationship with your manager. You are there to enable  him/her to focus on and look good.  Culture is good,  as long as you are honest,  Forthcoming when you may have made a mistake,  and instill confidence that whatever problem comes up, you will own it!  There are extremely smart people at Microsoft, so UTILIZE it.  Be willing to admit ignorance and be open to learning every day!  Best part of the job is encountering a problem and then Finding a solution and resolving it.. there is no better feeling!  Also I must say that one VERY nice feature about Microsoft is that it has a very efficient and strongly stable infrastructure.  There a policies and ""best practices""  that encourage this... and unlike some other organizations I have worked at,  the IT environment, as a rule is not a chaotic mess.  This In my opinion is among the best features about working there."
good,Hard work and quick pace expected. Smart people undergoing a big corporate change with new CEO. Up to big things globally still a great opportunity to work for this company.
good,"Overall great company to work for, management style varies depending on the team, but usually very competitive. Growth opportunities vary as well, one has to look constantly for next step."
good,"Depends on the department. MS Expects a lot of their employees, especially the contract workers. Overall individuals are great - collectively the company needs some work."
good,"While this company didn't pay much, it was great to be around so many people that loved technology.  Always looking to make things better for the next person and finding better ways to accomplish things."
good,"In the last decade, Microsoft Ireland has seen a significant change in its business. Moving from a localization site for products to more sales, support, services and marketing."
good,I loved the people I worked with at Microsoft. The management didn't care about us. They just wanted the numbers to be better and better. The office was nice and the grounds were always nice.
good,"Worked here several times as a contractor.  When working on non-gaming related projects, work was generally great.  Awesome co-workers, very responsive team members, etc.  Balance work load, learned alot about hardware dev/testing and really enjoyed myself."
good,Management is typically hands off and you have a lot of freedom in setting your workload and goals.  Keeping your skill sets current is a problem with the amount of work you typically get assigned.
good,"Be prepared to work hard, though you will get reward very well. The key to survival is to always move so no target is on your back. Do what is called the low hanging fruit. You will be measured on when you enter your time, submit reports, quarterly training, etc. This is all used to stack rank you, thus create poor performers. They figure that 10% of staff each year are poor performers, so they create false means to manage you out."
good,"I would not discourage anyone from going to work for Microsoft. Interesting work, great company and benefits. The quality of management varies greatly from office to office, but worth consideration."
good,"The hardest part of the job was not being able to have access to your email at all times.  It was an hourly role and Microsoft has a strict policy of working off the clock.  This role should have been a salaried role.  When you are planning events, you need to have access to those details in case there are questions when you are schedule off."
good,"Long days, supportive team.   Tons of email. Good training.  Brilliant people who appreciate hard work.  Mostly good managers but a few were awful. Especially the last one who was later fired."
good,Your product management team should be fired for forcing users to write reviews. This gets you the lowest possible quality of any action you could take.  You just got three useless ones from me.
good,"A decent place for a job, but probably not a career. Shaky job security and limited upward mobility make it a sub-optimal arena for long term growth, but a pleasant work atmosphere, comfortable workspace, and interesting projects make it an overall positive experience for short term work. I would happily work here again if I just needed a job, and wasn't looking for something bigger."
good,A professional and competitive place to work. There is a lot of pressure to stay ahead of the pack to ensure you are at the top end of the scale year in and year out.
good,"Though large companies had a tendency to have a lot of bureaucracy to overcome, the talent pool is very high.  Working with good people creates a good work environment which reduces the frustration of pushing through the bureaucracy to influence change."
good,"Microsoft is a constantly changing and growing company. Many Direct Managers are not able to keep up with the changes, so you are expected to be successful with minimal to no guidance or support. Successful employees quickly adapt and thrive in an agile company that changes direction constantly.  If you like an environment that will challenge you and offers the opportunity for constant learning and growing then, this is the place for you."
good,"Great opportunity. Working from home is the best. No commute just wake up and start my work day. Work is challenging highly technical and rewarding. Great team environment, even though you don't see your team members and managers, the sense of comradery is equal to face to face interactions."
good,"People are very productive and strong collaborative.  The head quarter is in Redmond which has the beautiful landscaping.  Employees got good perk such as free pop drinks, coffee, milk, parking, shuttle service between building, etc."
good,"Internal movement and career development need serious attention. I have been told more than once that I am ""Top Talent"" and received above average Rewards the past two years in a row. Yet my management does nothing to ""retain"" or ""develop"" me as part of their charter. "
good,"A more matured and structured technology firm"
good,Going through many changes but always interesting and keeps you on your toes.  Ability to move around the company is encouraged.  Upskilling and staying fresh on technology is key to success.
good,It has great benefits but unless you are friends with the manager or a managers favorite then you are really aren't going anywhere. Regardless the benefits are pretty good
good,le cadre de travail est totalement excellent et aagreable
good,"Microsoft is a good company but is struggling to find it's way in a new world.  They make so many changes and reorganizations that no benefit is ever achieved or realized.  3 reorganizations in 4 months and non stop churn.  Layoffs are now a part of the monthly operating cycle. "
good,Good work-life balance. The dynamic and challenging work environment pushes everyone to stay on top of the current technology. Safe environment for everyone.
good,There is good worklife balance. Flexible hours also helps. The dynamic and challenging work environment pushes everyone to stay on top of the latest technology. Safe environment.
good,Work is challenging and lots of executive reviews which takes away agility. Peers on the other hand are all smart and passionate.It's the work hours that makes the pay hard to justify.
good,"Depends on where you work. As a contractor, I had some limits of what I could accomplish, but generally Microsoft provided me with ample teams and resources to accomplish what I needed to, learn new tricks, and given the right environment work toward something better."
good,Good work good culture. a lot of challenging work is given . If an FTE awesome life but vendor payroll is sad. You wont get much opportunity. A lot of biases and you need n=butter your boss to get through.
good,"Big challenges, great enviroment and culture, It´s a great place to work."
good,Work/Life balance is a priority for me and the ability to work from home when I need is amazing. Not all teams are as flexible but my experience here is great!
good,"See summary, Depends heavily on what group you work for and your manager.  Some are awesome and others are posers and should have been fired years ago!"
good,Its a company that is constantly changing and fast moving. They are also pushing forward at a very quick pass. They have a tendency to move at a pass so that information are not correctly flowing thru all levels.
good,"Very relaxing work environment. Basically come in, get your work done. Reach a deadline."
good,"Very nice team to work with. "
good,"CEO is making right moves.  Middle management is stagnant.  Old performance model (stack ranking) is creeping back in.  Good flexibility, and overall balance is positive."
good,"Great position out of college that provided sufficient challenges and helped me grow as a professional. Work life balance was always stressed but difficult to come by at times as different teams are really pushed to the limits."
good,"Microsoft likes to win whenever it can, especially in new categories and unseat incumbents.  Personnel are smart, aggressive and intense.  Sometimes we overextended our capabilities."
good,While I was enrolled in the boot camp/cohort i realized how much i did not know technology.  It definitely opens one's eyes to help understand where you should continue your learning.
good,"Microsoft is a strong company, with very smart and talented people.  The CEO is putting the company back on the map.  Salaries and Benefits are very competitive."
good,Great place to work if you require great benefits and a good work/life balance. Unfortunately VERY limited opportunity for advancement with a very thick glass Ceiling.
good,"Microsoft is a place where you can work with very smart and driven people, and have the opportunity to constantly learn and evolve. Workplace culture is highly dependent on team, but trends towards flexible and empowering. On the other hand, Microsoft has a reputation for promoting and rewarding ""strategic"" delegators, who know how to take credit for the work of others, while failing to understand that strategy and tactics can and must coexist. In some orgs, this has lead to an abundance of non-technical, politically-driven managers who don't understand the tools and processes that allow an organization function, yet continue to be advance up the ladder by talking louder and ""playing the game"". While I've seen some positive change, I've also seen many talented individuals leave the company for ""greener"" pastures."
good,"Microsoft is a very large company. If you are working in the right group it can be great.  If you are not, it can be unbearable. "
good,"Pros:"
good,"always learning something new. comp is good, work life balance is good because you get a good amount of pto. if you can be in a project that's stable and performs well your job is secure."
good,"Microsoft has a good workplace culture. The emphasis is on delivering meaningful customer results. the company also embraces diversity and critical thinking."
good,"MS has been an excellent employer for many all over the world.  I was glad to have been a part of the organization.  It is a company with great programs, innovation and interesting projects.  "
good,"Workplace culture is pretty good,"
good,"Hyvä työnantaja. Hyvät edut."
good,The work here is monotonus.All day we are engaged on checking and video analysing.Its been a real boaring day.Overall lets say the friends that we have here is a fun .we hang out we tease each other and its a real happiness.thus when the happiness is shared among us it is the most enjoyable part of my job time.
good,"Jobs have great opportunities to learn and grow your skillset.  However, the high pressure demand of day to day is very stressfull.  Teams get eliminated and restructured all the time so you'll need to be prepared to grow your skills quickly and make yourself an asset to be able to move into other areas of business.  It's not stable by any means unless you are a blue badge.  They do awesome activities (holiday's, decorating, team building, ect) that I've not seen matched by any other company.  My kids always loved Halloween on campus because they could trick or treat each level of the building, go through the haunted house and decorate cup cakes in the cafeteria.  We looked forward to that each year.  :)"
good,"otima empresa, aprendi varias coisas como fazer contestação compra de materias e pagamento de funcionário."
good,A lot of learning experiences at Microsoft. They give you the opportunity to grow and expand your knowledge and skills.
good,Very smart and awesome people.  Teams looked after each other and did what needed to be done for the customer.  Very thankful for my time there and always rooting for them.
good,"- sehr gute Entlöhnung"
good,"I would have loved to stay at my job, but because of Microsofts policies around contractors and their unwillingness to regularly hire full time employees I've been forced out yet again. "
good,"Life at Microsoft can be both enjoyable and life fulfilling but it can also be stressful with a high level of burnout.  "
good,"Työni oli hyvin itsenäinen ja visionäärisiä kykyjäni hyödyntävä. Ainakin 60% ajastani loin joko uusia tai laadin parannuksia olemassa oleviin työtapoihin ja niiden riippuvuuksia kuvaaviin mallinnuksiin. Päivän viikossa käytin näiden asioiden kouluttamiseen ja ohjaukseen organisaatiomme sisällä. Yksi päivä tarvittiin myös palautteen keräämiseen, joten pidin katselmointeja ja osallistuin projektien työskentelyyn. Pystyn hallitsemaan suuria kokonaisuuksia, hahmoittamaan niiden riippuvuuksia ja seuraamuksia, laatu ja asiakastyytyväisyys ohjaavat päätöksiäni. Työyhteisöni on antanut täyden tuen työlleni ja olen saanut nauttia eriomaisten kollegoiden seurasta koko työurani ajan."
good,"I enjoyed working at Microsoft Nigeria because of the diversity of cultures that join to form the company. my typical day at work was unpredictable and very challenging. "
good,"Productive and Fun work place. "
good,"Good place to work personal life and work life balance, here is a free time for thinking and creating wireframes design  mock-ups also good encouragement from colleagues"
good,"Design, development, unit testing, and debugging of the Web applications.Team player with excellent technical, interpersonal and communication skills.Capable of quickly learning and delivering solutions as an individual and as part of a team."
good,Lots of different opportunities within the company but work experience typical day varies based on team or management or project. Some weeks will be 40 hours and other weeks it can be 50 to 60 hours. Management varies and some are great managers who are there to support you and help you learn on the job and grow your career while some are just to manage you. The hardest part of the job is dealing with ambiguity and unrealistic expectations and last minute budget cuts. The most enjoyable part of the job is having some great co-workers. Work life balance is tough at times although managers do encourage employees to do their best to own it.
good,Typical work day was full of interaction with Azure customers via twitter along with posting communications for any Azure related outages. Management was over worked and had quite the disconnect with what went on other then looking at spotting reporting. Co workers were great to work with except for one that seemed to have it out for others. The hardest part of the job was the lack of training on continues changes made for the job. Changes were being made and we were briefly notified about those changes.
good,Supporting customers implementing beta technology to understand and make sure new features are working as designed.  Just satisfactory to get a new version of a product that Affects a large number of customer and training internal coworkers on new features/functionality
good,"Microsoft services operates very sporadically, a lot of remote and little in person face-to-face time outside of client"
good,"It's a place with a strong American culture and great opportunity to know the people around the world, but as to locally in Switzerland, I found it's not that balanced in terms of workloads/roles/responsibilities."
good,This company appreciates and values everyone's input and grows leaders at every level.  Project based outcomes allow individuals to collaborate and energize each other.
good,this review is not relevant for my job search. if anyone would ^like to know more I please contact me directly via mail or phone
good,"MS è un'azienda in continua evoluzione e dinamica. Queste dinamicità, possono portare grandi opportunità per apprendere nuovi argomenti ma anche costanti sconvolgimenti organizzativi ed instabilità."
good,"As a video game tester for Experis, you could not ask for a more fun job. Bring your nerf guns, potluck dishes, and be prepared for lengthy discussions on the current state of the Marvel universe. The job itself looks easy from the outside but is challenging to do well, and that said, you will work for many many hours for months at a time, sacrificing your social life or sleep - you pick."
good,Good place to expertise the technical skills. System Centre skills were developed here at max. Working under great leadership was always fun and picking up the escalations were very challenging.
good,"Lots of hard and interesting problems to solve."
good,This is a nice place to work if you enjoy daily jokes and a tight knit community. A sense of urgency is a must at this organization and everyone is aware of the goal and vision of the enterprise.
good,"Good place to work, "
good,Microsoft being one of the world biggest technology company and absolutely a mother of the most used window i learned a lot and am willing to share a lot
good,"Typically I sit at my desk calling and emailing customers attempting to fix their various issues. That's generally the extent of my job. I""ve learned how to deal with all sorts of different personalities. My boss is not a very good leader and would rather adhere to the scare you policy. Hardest part of the job is making it through 9 hours while sitting in a chair."
good,Not a bad place to work if you like coding & MSFT products. I've found that they idolize their own products and need to got out of that mindset so they can figure if the customer like the products and how to make them better not to please the employee but the customers.  Remember the customer knows what's best!
good,"A typical day involved answering calls from Microsoft Gold Partners for both technical and non technical issues."
good,"There are a lot of smart and talented people working in Microsoft.  "
good,"Microsoft is a great place to work, the perks are awesome, the culture makes you feel included but the management needs to change."
good,"Currently a Start up Company, this company is new and is growing.  There is the ability to learn many areas of the company."
good,"My review will not be typical because our situation was special. We were purchased from Nokia and a year later we were to be laid off and the office closed."
good,"Great company, culture is challenging, lots of opportunities but its more about who you know, than what you know. "
good,Progressive service delivery model with driving focus to the cloud.
good,"Identifying and resolving technical issues relating to Office 365 - Lync/ Exchange/ SharePoint. Case management by ticketing and bug tracking systems. Premiere Support Services for Enterprise Customers. "
good,"Company hires strong people from whom you can learn a lot."
good,"Overall Microsoft is a good place to work at benefits are decent. As far as growing, it is little slow paced."
good,I am a team player and get along well with my peers. I see coworkers as a chance to learn from each other as well as a chance to team build and laughter for stress relief. I enjoy a busy day. I've learned that in any position I have taken in any field I eventually rise above and stand out in my area as I am a fast learner and strive for perfection everyday. The most enjoyable part of any day is overcoming challenges several times a day and striving to master my position.
good,"As with all high tech companies, technology is the heart of Microsoft.  Experience is based on management and I have had good and bad managers, but overall it is a great place to work."
good,"Knowledge of .Net Framework, Garbage Collection, TCP/IP, Active Directory, WCF, WPF, UI Automation, coded UI, serialization/deserialization, accessibility"

good,"typical day at work was full of enthusiasm and knowledge sharing. engineers came together to solve business down situation where in other sections of the business helped to provide a seamless support to the customers."
good,Great atmosphere and co-workers. Management was hands on and ready to ensure that you are going to succeed.
good,Exciting department with high energy people. Great Company
good,"Huge portfolio of technologies. Top-notch management and other in-house trainings. Always dynamic, and many skills and areas of technology to master."
good,"Trabajo muy creativo, al encargarme de un abanico de funciones, muy diversas. Todo desarrollado en un gran ambiente de trabajo."
good,I have been consulting for the past three years now and am looking to further my experience at a different company. The great part about being a program/project manager is the variety of roles you can experience. I have worked in three separate groups and I have learned so much from each. 
good,A great company that revolutionized the computer industry and is trying to make itself relevant in the age of the internet
good,Absorbed by Symantec. Great place to work that no longer exists. Learned quite a bit including SDLC methods.

good,I love to work for Microsoft it is very easy and reliable. I get up early and check my email rom clients and respond to them accordantly. I love to assist people with there issues so that they can enjoy the product offered by Microsoft. Helping Students to get the full potential of the software.
good,La experiencia en definitiva ha sido positiva.
good,Engage customers on daily basis to help determine which Microsoft products are best suited to their needs. I also assist customers in helping to correct any issues that may occur on their PC or any other Windows enabled device.
good,"Spent a total of 16 years with Microsoft, so have experienced many highs and lows, transitions, management, etc."
good,Great place to acquire knowledge base...a very friendly culture...employee learned to team together to solve some of the most unpredictable issues concerning operating system of all kinds.
good,Everyone had a eye on the ball and focused on achievement. Management was focused on themselves and not on the success of the teams needs and skill sets
good,- Championing the customer and advertiser experience to improve our products.
good,it was a very good company overall. Had great co-workers the pay was ok.
good,I love the company. It is a good company but not a nice company.
good,Interesting place - full of great and smart people from everywhere around the world.
good,"The environment was great. You work with a lot fo young people that are energetic and fun. Advancement from Contract to Hire was difficult and it seemed like, atleast the org I was in brought in more people from outside as oppose to hiring form within."
good,"I found Microsoft to be a flexible place to work. A lot of very intelligent people work there, so you are in good company. I learned how to manage up and pitch my ideas to GMs, which has been helpful. The hardest part is the amount of reporting and the requests for campaign reports coming in late at night. The best part is you are paid well and are rewarded for your hard work."
good,"Working at Microsoft is fun and at the same time competitive. The management is very helpful and supportive. Work culture wise, they are very flexible and believe in supporting their employees to their best capacity. The most enjoyable part of the job is that they allow you to speak your mind and all ideas are welcome. Salary wise, generally they pay less than the market average or expected."
good,Company has great culture and a great portfolio of products. The salary levels are low in India compared to product management roles in other companies.
good,"high pressure, flexbile work hours,"
good,"overall, it's a good place to work, and an interesting experience. be prepared for internal job hopping, which can be time-consuming because of the internal interviewing process. Don't expect to stay in one position for more than three years."
good,"The Garage is a great place to gain a new perspective on Microsoft. Most teams are siloed within their own org.  However the Garage touches virtually every part of Microsoft, ranging from cloud solutions, consumer products, and B2B relationships."
good,"Overall, a tremendous experience.  Worked with smart, driven people and enjoyed the exposure to cool technology.  Felt proud to be a part of Microsoft for many years."
good,Microsoft is making great strides in the right direction in terms of culture and balance. Your experience depends almost entirely where your group is in that evolution.
good,Microsoft is a great place to work. However you start working comfortably on one team only to be reorged into another team/role. Excellent benefits. Work/life balance can be challenging.
good,"I loved every moment at this job until the change in management at my specific location. Even though we were under the flag of Microsoft, management ran the ship how they wanted and would force us to grin through it when their supervisors came. This was a great example of how a person in power can ruin the lives of everyone underneath them."
good,I've worked for Microsoft for a few years and have really enjoyed my experience. Some aspects of the company are not the best however the company hires exceptional staff and you have a ton of growth opportunities if you put in the work.
good,"Good learning environment. Depending on group, might get exciting projects. Great work-life balance. There's one skill or the other that can be obtained working in various groups."
good,"I was a contractor. No job advancement. I was lucky that the team I worked for was very happy with me, so I worked in the same team till I decided to change for advancement of my career."
good,"Peers are nice in our team, workplace was cool, learned some skills, fun to work at, relaxing working atmosphere, a lot of work per day but give great achivement"
good,"Microsoft is a great place to start a career with a strong support structure for new, and less experienced employees right out of college.  Great energy, collaboration, and team building.  Microsoft is customer focused and mission driven.  The hardest part is being able to navigate the company since there are many roles and processes to learn and follow.  The most rewarding part is serving our customers with a team that is focused on successful delivery!"
good,Company compensates well.  very competitive environment to work in.  Culture has a tendency to value relationship over competency. People who network well and get higher level backing generally get the sexy high profile assignments with ample resources.
good,Microsoft provides its employees several opportunities for training and self development. Some Organizations lack clarity and employees have to work through some ambiguity. Overall great company.
good,"I spent my good as well as bad time with Microsoft and learned a lot over a very short period of time. It was very challenging and dealt with so many different things day to day."
good,just do not want to post a review .Because it is every indivisuals observation abovecomments are just from my findings .So it would be not to say something
good,"In Microsoft Consulting Division large number of Type A consultants, generally friendly, knowledgeable and professional. Management is driven but very few adept at helping you navigate work/life balance."
good,"Get ready to be challenged, great benefits, manage your work life balance and watch your back. Teams are great but inter group politics can be frustrating."
good,"Microsoft is a very large company with a variety of internal groups and division that offer the flexibility of working for a dozen companies.  The quality of management is spotty, It very much  depends on the group that you end up working in. In some cases, the management is excellent, in others, not so much.  The level of politics pretty high with the amount of red tape to deal with can be overwhelming."
good,"If you like to work hard and play hard, Microsoft is the place for you.  Opportunities for personal as well as professional growth are the norm, and the paths to success are as varied as the locations they offer."
good,"Technology is  v ery good. But Management is very bad."
good,"I worked with people in my high school, which was great for the work environment due to me knowing all the employees and being generally friendly."
good,My experience at Microsoft was okay. Management and coworkers were friendly. You are promised career advancement opportunities but you soon realize that it as all a façade.
good,I enjoyed my time working at Microsoft. Latterly significant changes to the environment were made to reflect business conditions. Most good. Some less so.
good,"Overall, a great place to work if you have the right manager.  A bad manager can hurt your career to the point it is difficult to recover.  There are too many re-orgs, which sometimes makes career goals difficult to achieve."
good,"Worked part-time and they did a good job of working around my full time job. Good job culture and good people."
good,There are some great opportunities to learn new knowledge or skills. Everyone is expected to be highly self-motivated.
good,"Great Place to work; wish I was there longer. The Position was work from home; however, this did not stop us from having a great team and support relationship."
good,"Microsoft is, overall, a good place to work. Major focus on utilization and the review process. Typical day at work involves customer support via phone and email. Good opportunity to learn skills in Microsoft products."
good,"Microsoft is a leader company for it business so I have learned much about the total market and new trends. most enjoyable part is to see the total market from different angle, you can touch all vendors, retailers and channel if you work at Microsoft."
good,I was a summer intern at Microsoft and I got to work with a sweet of really wonderful individuals who guided me throughout the entire summer. It was a good learning experience.
good,"Good leadership, progressive environment, poor work-life balance, often organizational changes, good pay and benefits, work from anywhere, energetic teams"
good,"In the time I worked at Microsoft, I experienced a ""survival of the fittest"" workplace. You either grabbed your seat at the table and made sure your voice was heard, or it it wouldn't be. No one invited you to share your opinion, no one was going to take you by the hand and show you the way. The best advice I received was in my first year from a woman I admired for her influence and confidence. She said, ""The way to be successful at Microsoft is to find a problem to solve that no one else is solving. Make sure solving it supports our mission, and then go for it."" I took that advice to heart, and in every role I had from then on I was a problem seeker, and when I found that problem I viewed it as an opportunity to make things better, have positive impact, and learn something new. I had to gather my courage many times to speak up about the problems I identified, I had to be tenacious, to come prepared with solutions, and to persist despite being dismissed or ignored. The lessons I learned in doing that serve me to this day, and I'm grateful for them."
good,Growth opportunity. Learned new skills. Opportunity to move into new roles and work with teams for knowledge base and personal development. Worked with alliance partners.
good,Great place to work but beware of reorgs and management changes as they can have a significant impact on our career and generally not for the better. Managers are either great and supportive of their teams or not...not much middle ground.
good,"Good working place, enjoyable culture. I was an intern at the company back in 2015 and I enjoyed working with them. Management is the best and understanding at all times"
good,"management is not up to the mark, less knowledge in india , very much perceived about engineer doesn't notify you when you doing wrong."
good,Microsoft is a great company to work for. The management was virtually nos existent.  Manager was not personal and always absent.  Periodically received hate emails> Manager was not sympathetic to individuals and relies on 'matrix reports' to run his department
good,Must figure out work life balance in the oncall cycles until automated system are matured. Loses good talent like every other cloud company because of this and too many reorganization’s moves.
good,"Able to work autonomously, but with great pressure to meet tight deadlines and daily/weekly online status reports.  Culture was almost entirely vendors, with only 1-2 FTEs to a project. All-hands meetings, benefits, and perks for FTEs only creates a upper vs. lower-class hierarchy between FTEs & vendors."
good,Microsoft is a large company that provided a diverse set of skills and opportunities.  It is the employee that must drive their career path as most managers are focused on the tasks rather than employees.
good,"as an employee, you have unlimited access to information to get your job done. I learned a lot about the upcoming technologies and was able to implement it at customer sites. I appreciate my time that I was there."
good,This is a company where experiences are fully shown and all tech apps are known and placed on current tasks and duties.  It is a company will like to work again.l
good,"Working at Microsoft is somewhat an honor. That being said I would say to stay strictly away from the retail side. Most of the managers in that division come from other retailers and don’t really share much of the culture the company strives for, this is due to a lack of education and compassion. - Compensation isn’t ideal unless you are just starting out in the tech industry, they pay less than ideal wage to their service advisors ($33k - $45k/yr.) whereas a similar position in corporate is anywhere between $50k - $80k/yr. If you still want to work for Microsoft after reading this, please focus in getting a job at the Redmond or Bellevue Campuses. STAY AWAY FROM RETAIL."
good,"Nice relaxed atmosphere that supports a ""Growth Mindset"". Microsoft's message is to promote career advancement, but sometimes it also feels like your direct work group will not recognize your efforts to do so. I believe it's a solid place to harness your passion for technology,."
good,"Basically, your manager decides on your rewards based on their review.  So if you have a good manager then all is great.  One of the best things is that you can ""interview internally"" for jobs and there are LOTS of interesting jobs."
good,"It was an awesome experience working for this brand.I had a great District Manager, flexible schedule and I had a route that was convenient for me. They also had a lot of perks for their employees!"
good,Retail is difficult. At my former location the management staff was not willing to work with you on changing your schedule. The team fell apart and they brought on too many negative managers. The employees complained a lot about the work but did nothing to improve their circumstances. Theres room for advancement if you know where to look. The benefits were amazing.
good,"Microsoft is a strong well-developed tech company. As a long time company it is impressive how much the culture has been changing over the years. Overall, you can do interesting work, have a lot of responsibility and a good work life balance. However, work opportunities for my role are few and far between even as long time employees."
good,"It was a laid back team. Not much learning due to the nature of the work and my role."
good,"Microsoft is a dream place to work as an engineer. The downside is that the Information Security departments are managed by non-technical project managers, whos primary goal is ""status projects"". I saw some amazing people leave because they did not prioritize a project that got their manager in front of an executive, and instead focused on improving the security of the corporation. The benefits, work/life balance, and people (outside of management) were amazing."
good,"A fun place to work especially if you love XBox. Customer obsession is a must, so be prepared to dazzle them upon engagement. Greeting is number one, and a smile is a great thing."
good,"10+ years of fun, lots of changes, awesome people all around. The hardest part was to have to leave as I was a contractor and there is a 18 months maximum rule."
good,"After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there's 90,000 employees, don't think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies."
good,"Microsoft is a decent place to work, though the routines and processes are repetitive, and there is little opportunity for advancement if you are in a field sales role. MSFT needs to improve its sales game, and focus more on the customer."
good,"Even with all of the changes that they have gone through over the years, Microsoft remains a very attractive workplace with a competitive environment. If you want to be as close to the bleeding edge of technology, this is one of the few places that you will be able to do so at."
good,"I enjoyed the role I had in the position as well as the team and management. I found them respectful and relaxed as long as the work was done. I learned a lot about the unique culture of Microsoft and a lot about some internal software used to track study data. The hardest thing about the job is that they are often slow to set up access so you can spend a day or more just sitting there and the most enjoyable is, as always the work and the people."
good,"There are a lot of great people, but there are bureaucratic silos.  So it is very challenging to improve the processes and make a difference.  In general the work day is pretty even keeled, but when things go wrong the environment get manic."
good,"The environment is very laid back. you can wear what you want, break when you want, come in late and leave early, work from home whenever; as long as you doing your job."
good,"Management could be improved. Overall, pretty standard retail culture (better scheduling given to those who have a better relationship with the scheduling manager)."
good,Flexibility in working on campus and from home helped tremendously in having work/life balance. Innovative and competitive environment. Changes constantly to support constant re-engineering and improvements.
good,"I got the chance to work with all types of people every day. I learned how to manage large scale events from construction build up, event management and construction tear down. The travel was great and the team members I worked with were awesome."
good,A quality employer with a lot of opportunities for those with significant career experience.Challenging for those early in their careers as the bar as quite high.
good,"Great company but it is in transition which has influenced the culture.  I am PROUD to be a Microsoft employee but there are cultural ""blind spots"" that go unaddressed."
good,"Microsoft unter Satya Nadella ist im Wandel begriffen, was aber nicht bedeutet, dass so etwas wie Jobsicherheit existieren würde."
good,"Great work environment with minimum supervision. "
good,"Microsoft is a great employer in terms of its growth.  When company grows employees grow.  "
good,"Team oriented, yes there is a ping pong table and pool table at work.  Co-worker are encouraged to share information and are very supportive. The level of customer service we provide to our customers is exemplary.  Overall a great place to work and grow,"
good,"Overall, Microsoft is a great place to work. However, as a vendor under a contracting agency within University Recruiting, it is not a good experience."
good,"I was leading a team of 30 people consisting of linguists, localisation engineers, editors and project managers. It was a challenge job in that you had to meet many milestones, manage productivity and volume of work efficiently, and juggle between different kinds of commitments. But I enjoyed it because I had the opportunity of work with very smart and talented young people who worked very hard and supported each other. It was a very cooperative and closely knit team that was always ready to go extra mile whenever needed."
good,"Strong CEO Strategy and Direction."
good,"I've been with Microsoft for over 15 years as a contractor, so I guess there is that.  I haven't ventured out to other companies yet.  Part of the problem is that I've become so locked into the .NET stack that other tech companies don't want to touch me as I don't have Open Source experience.  This was a mistake on my part not to venture outside of MS to get so solid experience with Linux, MySQL / Oracle, etc, and Java of course and JS.  Now I'm desperately trying to move outside of MS technology."
good,"Best IT desk I've worked. They went managed services and moved to Bangalore, otherwise we'd all have stayed employed. With over a 90% first call resolution rate we took good care of the Microsoft employees."
good,"Awesome experience working in Redmond in the Surface group."
good,"You work HARD for your money at Microsoft, but it's a great company and the people there are great. As in many companies Managers often aren't ready for their role, and need more training on coaching people."
good,Vendors are not treated equally to full-time employees.........................Nice drinks and snacks provided.some buildings are shabby.Some buildings are good.Not every building has the cafeteria.Have to go to the different building to get the lunch.
good,The company was run on spreadsheets and old database when I cam on board in 2008. I was able to create an complete MRP system using Microsoft Access working directly with the owner.
good,"Great company! Great products. Exciting times at Microsoft. Tough management and hard to advance. If you're looking to advance, leave the company and come back."
good,Work is interesting and never short of challenges.  Must be good communicator and influencer to succeed.  Environment is always changing and you must be agile and smart about your goals and connections
good,"The environment is very laid back. you can wear what you want, break when you want, come in late and leave early, work from home whenever; as long as you doing your job."
good,"Loved working there. Only downfall is that you are constantly being restructured causing uncertainty in your role. You will see RIF's (layoffs) all the time. Most of which, their direct manager had no say in."
good,Very mechanical but a good place for a steady job.  enjoyed the technology and education provided by the company.  I appreciated the support provided by senior management.
good,As a large employer there are loads of opportunities and different divisions you can work in.  Company culture is greatly influenced by which group you work in.
good,"There are many different jobs, roles and groups. But increasingly, the jobs are becoming more technical. Contract jobs now have an 18 month limit, with a 6 month break required."
good,An excellent company that taps our potential sends us to missions to provinces around the country.  The bosses are cool and you get to call each other by names.
good,"Productive , fun and at times stressful. For the most part it is relaxed but are still able to be productive and meet deadlines. Leadership will stay hidden in their office, it is up to you to seek them out for conversations."
good,Worked with VPs and programmers.  The executive assistant pretty much works independently and is responsible for asking questions and getting the work done.
good,"You did not have to work extra hours from home or on the weekends.  Very flexible, excellent benefits and time off.  Very little room for advancement as an executive assistant."
good,"Fun fast environment.  Strong leadership moving the company in a positive direction.  You will work with smart, creative people.  There is a wealth of opportunity."
good,Work life balance is a bit crazy in MCS but can be doable. Benefits are great. Pay is great. Its a roll of the dice if you get a good manager and a bad manager.
good,"La posibilidad de trabajo remoto es muy buena. Te da la posibilidad de equilibrar tu vida privada con tu trabajo. Hay, además, un muy buen clima laboral."
good,"Microsoft has Great Campus , Library,  Good Place, Good Work culture. It has various indoor and outdoor facilities. Sports like cricket, tennis. Free Zumba and Yoga classes."
good,The company is evolving. overall experience is positive. New CEO has vision and strategies that could potentially help the company transform and catch up the fierce competition.
good,"Great company depending on the manager you get. The have a positive work environment and a very well-defined company culture, free drinks, coffee, tea, several great cafeterias an inter-campus transportation system and if you are a Microsoft employee you are entitled to their bus system."
good,this is a company that really cares about their employees and maintains very good life/work balance. Salaries are competitive and good number of employees have been there for a long time.
good,"As a participant at the Microsoft Development Event, it was a wonderful experience to speak my mind to the crowd from different different cultures and countries."
good,"Flexible hours as long as work is done on time and in good quality."
good,"Very fast paced, type A environment.  Encouraged creative thinking.  Harder to promote when outside of Corporate HQ.  Enjoyable workplace culture with opportunities to network."
good,"Interesting direction now with cloud services and windows 10 brings windows back to relevance as a modern OS."
good,"Microsoft is a great place to work.  It provides challenging but satisfying opportunities to make an impact on the world.  A learning culture is encouraged, and employees are expected to grow by taking risks, learning from failure, and adapting quickly."
good,"Typical work day is fast pace with a great opportunity to learn. "
good,"I was very lucky to have a great boss who turns the stressful workplace to a fun, lively and a learning classroom."
good,"Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. As of 2016, it is the world's largest software maker by revenue,[7] and one of the world's most valuable companies."
good,"My time there was short, I was a contractor not a full employee. We were given a project and a time limit and set loose. we worked crazy hours, some time 90 hr a week or more but were paid very well for it."
good,"Lots of opportunity to learn and grow in it industry. Can easily learn new technologies like EXO, mailflow, sfb, sharepoint, identity management and adfs."
good,"I enjoyed working on the Native Languages keyboard optimization project.  "
good,"In the 90s as a PM you used to work on many aspects of the product - design, process, operations, project management, research, feature ownership, technical design. nowadays in some parts of the company you might find this type of PM duties, but many times you are stuck with just project management..."
good,"Being a fast paced environment, feels really stressful at time, but highly innovative and opportunity to learn. Being a contractor, had limitations but was welcoming environment."
good,"Overall one of the easiest going workplaces I've ever been at. Benefits are amazing, although they have been steadily being removed over the last few years. Management has too many layers that are never on the same page and contradict each other at every turn. That's really the only bad thing I have to say. It can be difficult to know what you're supposed to be doing at a given time, as that depends on what part of management you're reporting to at the moment. Your priorities change sometimes several times a day, along with what is and is not able to be used to get the job done."
good,When we talk about Operating system in today's world the first thought that comes in our mind in Microsoft. that is the impact that this company has created. Working in such a company is a great pleasure. You get to learn a lot in this company on a daily basis which why i have spent 12+ years in this company and still enjoy my job. Yes the company no i would say the management needs to improve and think about the work life balance of the engineer and pressurize to work.
good,Great company with incredible employees who are focused on creating happy customers by making them successful in the use of Microsoft products.
good,"Gives you exposure to Microsoft Technologies."
good,Friendly and collaborative environment work life balance needs work due to cuts in headcount. Remuneration packages were good but did not keep pace with the increased cost of living.
good,Good place to work. Lots of talented people. Not easy to move within the company. Overall the company is doing good and heading in the right direction.
good,"very friendly environment and work without any pressure."
good,"Microsoft is a place to Learn the Technologies in depth."
good,"Great compensation and benefits, but, if you're planning to make a career there, you must continually be your own recruiter."
good,"The Sodexo was a good place to work, it had good clients that interactive with you and let you know what their need and wanted. The management was ok, I wish express more interest in their employee's more."
good,"I really enjoyed working here. The environment was great. All the resources I needed to do my job were provided when I needed them. Great perks on campus. My only issue was the senior management. The lower management was great. They were helpful, and there to answer questions or help with whatever you needed. An open door as it should be. The upper management was seriously out of touch. The director at my group gave four days notice that we might be laid off. We were supposed to receive additional details the following day, but he decided to take a trip to Disneyland instead. Needless to say, we were informed of the layoff on Tuesday and out the door that Friday. Totally messed up."
good,"Microsoft was a great place to work with really motivated and intelligent people. I found that the company culture was laid back and diverse.  I learned a lot off of Excel and streamlining some of the operations.  The biggest drawback was the budget cuts that ended up laying off people quickly. These decisions tend to be top-down and came with little or no lead time.  Vendors seemed to be used a lot to avoid paying out benefits as MS is notoriously known for.  I would have liked to stay longer as there were great people on my team, but that was just not in the cards."
good,Was a contractor managing a large team.  This was a fun culture and very talented people. IT was great to be on the cutting edge of technology that everyone was familiar with.
good,"As Windows OS is close source, it has always been a challenge to write device drivers for  Windows OS. Working for Microsoft gives a chance to peek into the Windows OS source code and it immensely improves the quality windows device driver software that one can write. "
good,"A typical day on the Skype for Android team meant meetings, testing new builds, maintaining the database of test cases and defect reports, and getting new test builds to our internal dogfood testers and external beta testers."
good,"dans le titre, beaucoup de projet dans tous les sens. Un management de très grande qualité."
good,"A lot of good people, great teams and spirit, different cultures and diversity. "
good,"As a UX Design contractor and first time position as a UX designer, I have found Microsoft to be a better overall place to work than expected. It has been a great place to learn and grow and I have found the culture to be slightly dull but overall professional, comfortable and fairly diverse. I think they still struggle on many teams in implementing UX in an effective way, but I see effort on my team at least in trying to work toward UX lead processes and getting everyone else to get with the program."
good,"I manage a team of 4 Shift Leads, 4 Tech Leads, 3 Migration Velocity Managers, 2 Migration escalation leads, and several Migration Engineers totally 30 employees. I'm in charge of ensuring clearances are met for federal contracts. Ensure all SLA's are met. And manage day to day operations of the org."
good,"If you're into computers, have the knowledge, and want to share it with the world, this is the place for you. Management is friendly and a bit too personable, but they're good people. The crew is a good group of people to work with, though they can get a bit annoying. There is a lot to learn here, so you'll never feel bored."
good,"A good company to work for.  Very supportive, collaborative coworkers and an environment that allows you to work on a wide range of projects.  Process and approvals can be cumbersome.   Also promotions are far and few between as it's such a good company, people don't leave!"
good,"Microsoft is a vast company but with not so clear of decisions, they spread around alot and whenever you want to come with something new, you have to go through alot of steps to get an approval."
good,"Great place to develop your career and gain insight across an entire corporate business. Encourage an open forum, and you really feel your voice is heard."
good,"work hard, very professional and highly intelligent colleagues. "
good,"The overall experience was a great one. Work/life balance was what drove me to pursue something different. Microsoft is an amazing company to work for, the job culture was one of the best I've been in."
good,"Work tech support as a contractor for MS. Really enjoyed the work, but was ultimately outsourced overseas and laid off."
good,"Like any other company, the Company is as good as your immediate Management. Having said that, Microsoft as a whole is a great company to work with. Lot of opportunities to learn, share and have a healthy Professional Life."
good,Productive WorkPlace with a young and enthusiastic workforce/ full of exciting ideas and willingness
good,"Challenging, exciting place to work, good for someone focused on enterprise software services and platforms, not good if interested in consumer technology or services."
good,Good to work in microsoft good work Enviroment the management also good but the thing they reat diifernt for contractors only the one thing
good,Flexible working hours and engaging colleagues. Majority A type FTE therefore everyday is a new challenge and its never boring.
good,"Besides regular activities, organized in the fiscal year calendar, I lead priority projects and coach members of my team. I connect with peers  in the headquarter office and in the subsidiaries to help and be helped. The hardest part of the job is to balance quarter end time bound commitments delivering all of them on time and with quality. The best part of the job is to work with a team spirit and enjoy the friendly work environment."
good,"I would not change a thing in these past 16 yrs. I've worked with the highest caliber of people and grew professionally. "
good,Microsoft is a relaxed environment that supports and nurtures employees to grow. The most enjoyable part of the position is to be able to support the account managers and achieve their Customer satisfaction targets. The peers are friendly and diverse. Management has an open door policy.
good,"Challenging place with nice people. Feedback from management was quick and helpful. The most difficult aspect was getting consistent information, but it was a very good experience."
good,"There is considerable pressure on the Project Teams to deliver against aggressive schedules.  The Redmond campus has excellent workplace balance functions which are essentially there to offset the extensive number of hours that tend to be worked."
good,I like the flexibility to work from home but the pay and OT are not balanced. I work many hours with limited assistance and am not as well paid as many of the FT teams.
good,"Multi cultural, diverse, great work environment offering several onsite activities such as yoga, boot camp, running, biking, soccer, Toast Masters, etc."
good,"With the global supply chain, Microsoft gave me a platform to flex my concepts and develop as there is always something new to learn."
good,"IT problem solving for Microsoft Exchange Server, phone calls and remote sessions with clients, research for solutions and technical reports were my daily duties."
good,"Uma empresa que me ensinou a tomar decisão, gerenciar conflitos, negociar, ter empatia e liderar,tive dois ótimos lideres que nunca vou esquecer na vida que me ajudaram muito no meu crescimento profissional, parceiros internos que sempre me ajudava quando precisava, e era reciproco da minha parte."
good,"While I am a contractor for both HP and Microsoft, I am treated as one of the business family.  I am responsible for growing the business with some of the largest channel partners which entails training, pipeline activities, reporting and relationship management."
good,"At the Microsoft Data Center you will have your days go quick, it is a very fast paced environment, tons of people to meet and good atmosphere overall. Management when I was there was okay, they are now gone. But keep in mind I was hired through a contract agency who eventually lost their contract."
good,"C'è la possibilità di imparare molto specialmente in ambito tecnico. "
good,"Interesting and, unique place"
good,"It's a fantastic workplace.  Great group of smart people and a very relaxed work environment.  However, as with most large companies, there are plenty of politics and direction becomes muddied."
good,great employee benefits and fantastic flexibilities but lots of egos getting in the way of progress.  Can't rely on the past successes to enable the future.
good,"Great company, learnt a lot during my time there as Program Manager and other roles such as Operations Manager and Team manager"
good,"I was lucky enough to be involved with Microsoft through vendor roles. Although the company was notorious for treating vendors poorly, I was placed with sensational teams who treated me equally. Even as a vendor there were multiple projects on my plate that I needed to perpetually juggle. But I don't view this as a con because it allowed me to learn a lot about myself, my limits and gain valuable experience."
good,"Microsoft is a great place to work if you have the drive to achieve your best. With a great benefits package and the availability of monetary and stock rewards for good performance, it will satisfy almost all new college graduates who have a yearning for success."
good,"A Monday through Friday work schedule environment, that comprises meeting goals and targets set for each projects. Despite the busy schedules, team building, games and refresher courses contribute to maintain the family bond that has been established at EGS/Microsoft"
good,"Confidence in handling telephone calls"
good,"Interfaced with many groups in order to assess scope of work, interview vendors, manage budget, keep developers to schedule and publish final content."
good,Teamwork Athletic Apparel is nice place to work. I really enjoyed working there if they don't sent their jobs to over sea.
good,Por lo intenso de las actividades del día a día se logra la especialización y con ello se perfecciona la curva del aprendizaje.
good,"the people one works with are very intelligent and passionate about their successes.  Competition is high and mostly healthy.  I enjoy working here because it is always a challenge.  I constantly learn new things and am allowed to be creative with my work.  the days can be long but that is expected when dealing with a global product.  "
good,After Microsoft purchased Nokia Phones business it was very interesting to gain access on all technology development at MS. But unfortunately it was not clear to all levels at MS organization what was intention with Nokia Phones purchase
good,"You have to meet upright manager and leadership. "

good,"sales Teams are very productive and fun to work with. Most of management will give you ability to sell without close supervision "
good,"This a great retail job, but outside of retail it can be difficult to grow. Communication is not used well and there is no sense or responsibly."
good,"Big stuff, big projects, big goals, everything is big. Unfortunately this also applies to the bureaucracy. It gets in the way when you're trying to be agile."
good,I had a great time working for Microsoft in these three months. I was working as a Business Administrator( contractor) and my experience was very enriching. Learned many technologies and MS tools which will give me a platform to explore my knowledge for further job opportunities.
good,"Worked as a mechanical engineer on fun new products. In the Studios.  Not everyday do you get to work on a product with volumes of 20-40 million per year.  Cool."
good,"Microsoft es una gran empresa para trabajar y la gente ahi trabaja a gusto, sin embargo me toco trabajar en un departamento que estaba bajo mucha presión de resultados, en el que había incertidumbre sobre su futuro y terminó siendo cerrado. Frente a esta situación, que se extendió por muchos meses siempre vi a la compañía muy pasiva y poco proactiva con los que trabajábamos ahí. Nunca hubo una real preocupación por nosotros ni apoyo mayor luego de que el departamento cerró. Me llamó mucho la atención no en la mejor manera esto siendo una empresa GPTW."
good,"Good flexibility of hours, just be sure you are working at a store that makes a lot of sales otherwise it will be a slow day. Management are ok. Co workers are 50/50"

good,"As I performed an internship at the Microsoft Invoation Center, I had the occasion to improve myself and learned new things every single day (which, for me, is very important)."
good,"I enjoyed my 4 months working at Microsoft. The only issues I had was the lack of training to be successful at my job. Also, the lack of guidance from management and help, which made work very stressful at times."
good,"Enjoyed the challenging works, but work/life balance is tough.  It is a tough world, don't imagine if it is different any where else."
good,"This was a dream job for a qualitative researcher like me. I felt my manager was deeply invested in my intellectual development this allowed me to grow and not worry about the direct implications of my research and interview study. However, this company strength comes with its own weaknessI felt the research arm of the company was quite distance from the product arm of the company. As a result my research project had little direct impact on Microsoft's product development teams."
good,"Microsoft is a very driven company constantly moving and never slowing down. I have had many opportunities to grow in my work life, financial life, and my personal life. I start my day off at 6:30a with live event from international subs and move into streaming for the Redmond campus. My 3 person team streams around 500 live events a year and are constantly growing that number. The hardest part of my job is to remember to compliment myself on the work that's been accomplished as we tend to overlook the small contributions. However, I am most enjoyed when my customers walk away happy and feeling like they were well taken care of and that my teams gets the recognition."
good,"Microsoft is a dynamic company that offers vast amount of learning and experiances from an internal to external perspective. "
good,"Microsoft is a good environment to work in.  "

good,"Dynamic work across multiple countries and time zones"
good,I worked with several smart people who were highly driven . At the same time there were teams that were not very open to ideas.
good,the culture was eloping. one of the best companies as far as resources was undeniably abundant. Helped to reform abilities to critique my own work to see where I could improve on my efficiency and productivity. Culture helped create lasting bond between co-workers. overall great environment to work in.
good,"Microsoft is a great place to work depending on the job and people. Surprisingly, some of the people know very little about the technology they're working with, while others are actually the people creating the technology."
good,"Review Process is unfair and does not tie back to results."
good,Working for Microsoft has been a good experience overall. Helping people make sure they get the right computers and know how to use them is extremely fulfilling. Unfortunately I have come to realize that it is a place that is extremely difficult to move up in and the management has recently gone under change that makes it even harder and not very heatlhy for its lower level employees.
good,"I liked working at Microsoft because it was impressed on all the new hires in 1995 that it's employees were it's most valuable asset. The quality and depth of information provided to every employee was unmatched to any other employer I had ever worked for. Microsoft was sincerely committed to developing its employees to their highest potential. All that was required was a fundamental curiosity and desire to figure out how to turn a mountain of data into useful information for the problem at hand."
good,"Great company to work for.  Great benefits.  Lots of freedom, and tons of different products and tech to work on."
good,"A lot of opportunities to have a big impact. The Quality-based discipline is now gone, being replaced by ""software engineer"". The new combined (dev/test/quality) position is much more focused on development and less on testing in an effort to become more ""modern"". Unfortunately, using the product and having the ability to represent the customer seems to be loosing to greater technical and programming ability. Time will tell whether this results in higher quality products."
good,"The job is a great way to gain knowledge in customer service, accounts, and technical support"
good,Microsoft offers an opportunity to impact & influence the world through its products & services. Great place to learn and develop individually.
good,Microsoft is a good company to work for if you are NOT a vendor
good,"At Microsoft the work is both very demanding and rewording. It has been nice to see you’re able to make a divergence, even if you’re a contractor. Having worked in so many different groups (and types of positions) has given me a good view of the whole company."
good,"El nivel de exigencia, estrés y presión son muy altos y, en consecuencia, el nivel de conocimientos y experiencia adquiridos también lo son. Además se desarrollan habilidades muy útiles para un futuro crecimiento profesional."
good,"Great company, challenging work ..."
good,A good technology company with a friendly atmosphere. The work flow is claim and smooth. The management team is pretty easy going. The best part about the job is helping customers with their needs
good,Worked with a fantastic team who were always willing to support each other. Microsoft offered numerous opportunities for growing your knowledge across their solutions areas and technologies - challenging to take advantage within working hours. Often found that departments were so focused on reaching their own particular numbers/goals they lost sight of bigger picture with customers/partners.
good,"Excellent company. Work is very challenging, complex programs and projects, and the pace is very fast. Very diverse work environment. There is international contact even for positions that are domestic in nature. Provides opportunity to work with and learn from colleagues in other regions (Europe, Asia, Latin America, etc.). Almost all work is cross functional; matrix environment.   "
good,"excelente ambiente de trabalho, dinâmico. Colegas altamente capacitados. As vezes estrutura burocrática e lenta"
good,Microsoft is an excellent global company. The work environment is very dynamic and fast paced. The hardest part of the job is keep up with innovation and changing business environment. Competition in technology is fierce. The best part of the job is exactly the same; keeping up with technology is fascinating.
good,"Great company, great people, and a fun place to work."
good,Not too many interesting things if you are working in the traditional area.
good,I was introduced to CRM to and was able to learn the program and drive the business through it. Management was a plus they listened to new ideas. Overall  it was a good experience.
good,Microsoft is a great company. Your career here will be what you make it. You guide your career development and next steps to acheive success. Best for those with a high degree of personal and professional drive and self starters.
good,"I like the environment...I like the people I worked with. I liked the job that I did and the pay was appropriate. Benefits and perks were great. What I didn't like was the corporate political games....it was ""what"" you knew...it was always ""who"" you knew. If you are ok with stealing peoples ideas and selling it as your own, or throwing people under the bus to advance yourself, then Microsoft is the place for you....not me!"
good,I was a vendor at Microsoft. It is a great company if you can find the right team to work with.
good,"As a consultant, I was never actually an employee of Microsoft. But I've worked with one group exclusively for almost 3 years. Their continued renewal of my contracts has provided me with a consistent place to grow in the field of software development. "
good,"Regular interaction with Internal Clients, geographically spread, gives the much needed breadth & Challenges at work place keep's you updated and at speed."
good,Except the Services division in Pulic Sector. Poor management there. Other groups don't have this issue.
good,This job was awesome. Many cool perks and free benefits that accompanied this job. Management was not very on top of it.
good,"Microsoft sells its products primarily through partners. I worked for the largest enterprise ERP Latin American partner (ITS-Dynamics) and really enjoyed launching the U.S. business. The start up nature of the U.S. business meant that benefits were minimal but the pay scale was competitive. Invenio wasn't as much a software partner as a contract sales organization with an essentially telesales, crowded, cube environment. What I liked most about Invenio was that I was able to broaden my knowledge of Microsoft products and services beyond ERP."
good,"If you're the best, you'll be treated like a king. If you're just normal (by MS standards, which is the best at most other jobs), then you'll be under-appreciated. Good pay, lots of 50+ hour weeks. Fun atmosphere, with lots of morale events and talented fun people."
good,"check, triage stress machines. Get breakfast & coffee. send emails to proper dev for breaks. reset & install new build, test fixes."
good,Learning alot about Ecommerce and customizable payment systems for BGs
good,"You can't go wrong when you are working on creating games at Microsoft Gaming Studios. The only complaint I have from here is the lack of advancement. It's not really Microsoft's fault per se, its all gaming industries."
good,"Each groups is its own unique company, it depends on your work style there is not a one size fits all."
good,It is always busy at work every day. I always make sure a complete my task on time and. I am always ready to ask question and lean from things that I do not understand. I also share my ideas with my team members.
good,"There are some toxic managers - and they seem to escape any consequences (and are even promoted!!)   "
good,"Typical day you're expected to go 40+ per week."
good,Microsoft is full of opportunities and has growth mindset. Compensations is decent. Work life balance is also good it actually also depends on team your are joining.
good,"Work Life balance"
good,"Bring your A game, being smart in any role matters.  A growth mindset is an absolute, you have to keep growing in technical aptitude or other personal areas."
good,"My sales team had a high turn-over rate (over 50% in 2 years) and a poor work/life balance. Great benefits, pay, and C-level management. Good products but the increasing pressure of higher sales margins each year was daunting."
good,Exposure to many tools and diagnostics and the customers were amazing. The only issue I had working there was that I was contracted which meany no 401 K and no insurance.
good,"While working at Microsoft, i came to understand that, how we can manage to handle different way of clients. Few will be very sweet and soft and some will be very rude and rough.But still we be calm and handle the issue's in a easiest way."
good,The most enjoyable part of the experience was working with the technology and figuring out everything out about it. It helped me to think more abstractly when it comes to tech and how it can be useful.
good,"Other than the hand full of bad co-workers, Microsoft was an amazing company to work for. They care a lot about the employee and their needs. A very customer driven company, hoping to please everyone when possible."
good,"Was always excited to see what the day brought.  No shortage of activity and work.  High energy, inclusive, and diverse culture.  Colleagues were passionate about the work they did."
good,It was a good experience getting to see the extensive infrastructure Microsoft has at their disposal.  This gave additional insight as to how Microsoft tackles challenges.
good,Some of the smartest people I have ever worked with. Depending on what group you are in some of the leaders only have grown up inside Microsoft. It would be great to see them expand and get some industry evangelists in to supplement.
good,"good learning experience, Progressive workplace. would recommend giving this place a shot for long term employment as a full-time employee. not the best place for contract roles"
good,Overall Microsoft is a good company to work for. The retail division is inconsistent with the benefits and advantages of the greater company. Associate experience is determined by the quality of the store management.
good,Microsoft is a great company. I believe in its mission and fundamental transition to cloud. I was happy to be a part in this exciting time. As with any position it’s not what you do sometimes but who you work with.
good,"Worked in a very fast-paced environment, no idle time. Had a great bouns pay system.  Had a great management team that really want to see you succeed."
good,"I could find things to complain about, but compared to other tech companies I've worked for, Microsoft is leagues ahead in terms of how much I've enjoyed myself and my professional growth. Yes, the culture can be a challenge to navigate sometimes, and yes I was caught up in one of the big layoffs, but I'd go back to work there in a second. Most everyone I met there or worked with was at least as smart as I am and generally good people. I prefer the Microsoft I first met and worked for in the early 2000's to today, as it's more of a generic company with fewer perks and personality, but it's still the best place I've ever worked."
good,"I've been at Microsoft for 20 years.  There are great organizations dedicated to people growth, and bad ones.  Who you work for there is ultimately more important than what you *do* there."
good,It depends a lot on your team and division. Microsoft goes through a lot of reorgs and that sometimes makes things difficult even if you're not let go
good,Microsoft has great people to work with everyday which is the most enjoyable part of this job. The most challenging part of working in the Services organization at Microsoft is that it is not a core part of the business but is simply put in place to support the software sell & deployment.
good,"Microsoft was an intense, fun, rewarding place to work.  There is a severe onboard ramp up that you must undergo, it takes awhile to acclimate to the multitude of systems in place.  "
good,"Microsoft treats their employees as you would expect in a corporate environment, like employees. You are an adult doing adult work, so you are treated like an adult. The pay is optimal, benefits are better than almost everyone else, and their bonus structure is great. Culture is good, but there's also some that have their negative views (which really is with any job). All in all, it's a great experience."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity to work with a myriad of new technologies in big data computing. The annual data science conferences on campus are also a plus and are a great networking opportunity.
good,"It was a great place to work.  I would strongly recomend working at microsoft to anyone."
good,Microsoft as a company was a great place to work. I was paid well and given plenty of benefits. I enjoyed a great majority of my co workers and generally looked forward to work daily. I was with the company for 2.5 years and was always applying for advancement. Management seemed to play favorites though and I never got anywhere. I would recommend Microsoft products and as an employer to many people because the benefits outweighed the negative aspects that I experienced.
good,"Lots of opportunity for impact and advancement when you are new/early in your career.  Everyone very engaged."
good,"Ability to hone marketing skills by pushing innovation, new ways to deliver content, and driving customer engagement through more targeted, goal focused and strategic content planning."
good,We used to have a great team at the galleria location. The management team then got promoted and were replaced with less qualified candidates. That changed the entire culture of the store. These managers there now do not know how to keep employees satisfied which is the most critical thing to do in retail.
good,I had an opportunity to work with smartest people in the industry and thoroughly enjoyed every working day. I have got pretty good exposure to Microsoft Azure Services for Migrating on premise applications as well as building the PaaS applications.
good,"Overall a great company to work for, you get all the tools and enablers that you need to perform your job superbly."
good,"Being an computer technician is for the most part fun and very exiting ,finding the problem and solution from the system software is the best feeling. It makes me more confindent in the real life world. Although I will be responsible for troubleshooting, diagnosing and solving a variety of technical issues. This job makes me more postive day by day."
good,"Good culture & great flexibility. "
good,"Amazing experience when working in as a placement year student. The role was unique, challenging and focused on development, allowing me to put what I'd learnt at University into action."
good,"Microsoft is a good company. Good and healthy environment. Good people to work with. "
good,"Great place to work.  Learn about new and upcoming technologies."
good,Great place to work for depending on which team you are in and how company driven is your manager. Good benefits however job security is very uncertain so people focus on manager management rather than on product quality and customer satisfaction.
good,"Good overall. Some politics and hierarchy involved but not as toxic as other companies, with a good work/life balance and advancement opportunities for full-time employees. Vendors are often overlooked."
good,"Changing culture, good work/life balance, and new growth with cloud investments. Moving towards open source and away from ""not invented here"". As you grow your career, politics and process can be limiters."
good,"Although shown as Microsoft, I was actually working on Contract for SKYPE post the Microsoft acquisition through a consultancy (OOMRI)."
good,"I had a mixed experience, and chose to move on after eighteen months due to lack of opportunity in my particular career path and little viable option to move elsewhere within.  No regrets.  I do, however, take bulk of responsibility for not managing my career in-detail at Microsoft: one must do this to keep the options option internally, too."
good,"Overall, happy with the work environment and management style."
good,"A broad spectrum of exciting and relevant work -- from Xbox to Cloud, kind and diverse coworkers, and a work life balance that is untouchable among other top tech companies."
good,"I recommend Microsoft to anyone."
good,"Microsoft is a great place to work. Very loose, and open environment.  Laid back culture. Fast pace environment.  Colleagues are very helpful in helping out with issues."
good,"Old school management who knows how things have worked over the last 20 years, but don't have the same level of vision for years to come. Individual contributors should be listened to more when making decisions."
good,"I don't want to seem ungrateful. I love Microsoft as a company, I support its mission, and I'm excited about the products it puts out."
good,"had to travel in a very short notice for an onsite one on one meeting.  Then it turned into meeting with several different groups.  It was hard, but to the point and very productive."
good,"Location in Wilsonville designed and produced Surface Hub products.  Work was exciting and challenging, but being a remote site from Microsoft headquarters brought limited support and changes which were not always communicated on a timely basis."
good,"A good experience until it wasn't. Not all aspects are ideal. Vendors are subject to layoffs without warning. I was outsourced three times. Two of those times, I was asked to train my offshore replacements under the false promise that I was training them only as a backup when I went on vacation."
good,Working as a Product Advisor is not going to make you rich by any means but it's a great job with lots of fun opportunities for someone who is into computer technology and/or gaming.  It's still retail so the holidays can be very stressful but it's easy enough.  There are lots of different roles in the store so advancement is definitely an option if you do well.
good,Grateful to have an opportunity to be apart of an incredible team. They offer quality care to their workers and compensate people appropriately. Management team is kind and effective.
good,Great place to work. International team of knowledgable members. Benefits including subsidised canteen and very flexible working hours. Management was good for me but not always for other teams. Little autonomy: heavily centralised to US HQ.
good,I learned to be flexible and understand that changes can happen at any time. You have the autonomy to make decision but must understand they must be within the plan.
good,"Help Microsoft end users with technical difficulties with the software that they acquire. Do installation, virus removal, pc tune up and necessary software repair if needed. Making sure that every call is a good customer experience as well as insuring the resolution of the issue."
good,"It was great place to work, just advancement opportunities were not available and working hours were not letting me to have a normal life. its a great starting point at an IT Career."
good,Microsoft was a young and growing company when I joined. It was an awesome experience. As it grew though it became less enjoyable to work there. It became a stable company and so the types of challenges they face are very different now.
good,Microsoft is a great place to learn. There is a lot of autonomy in roles as well as accountability to the organization. There is a lot of opportunity to drill deep into your areas of responsibility and learn the various aspects of the organization.
good,"It's still a VERY big company, but for a company of that size, Microsoft really does care. The Ballmer-era thinking is slowly being weeded out, and the company is becoming more alive again. As always, though, it's about your manager—whether s/he will go to the mat for you, and whether s/he is appropriately connected."
good,It is a great place to work as the benefits are amazing and the opportunity is great.  The downside is that the direction changes constantly and they don't seem to know how to get there except expecting reps to just sell it with no real knowledge or understanding. There are a lot of reorgs that are causing fear constantly of losing your job.
good,"The company is great to work for. Lots of opportunities for different fields and technologies. Most teams respect work life balance. Management is hit or miss on quality. Career trajectory is highly dependent on team, some promoting faster than others."
good,"Great Company, set hours, good benefits, and leadership was open to feedback. Advancements were hard to obtain due to politics. Learned alot during my time from bright and brilliant peers."
good,"Microsoft offered a bunch of benefits for its employees and their families. However, work life balance was not as it was portrayed, and schedule specifications went unnoticed."
good,"Its ok for the younger group. Being in your mid to late 30's and working with 19-25 years old is stressful. Too childish for my taste. "
good,"Ambiente stimolante e competitivo, con opportunità di crescita"
good,"They did a great job providing their employees with the tools to succeed, maintained work/life balance (though that is more up to the employee than anything), but the leadership is always, and always will be, infighting. Too much internal competition and history made large changes for the greater good impossible."
good,"I worked there on 3 month contract as transactional specialist, I learned a lot but didn't get my contract extended. The days were going fast, great people, not the best pay and often overtimes but it was good place to make friends and learn about the business ."
good,"Management experience varies across the company.  It is highly recommended that one focuses on managing their own career, establishes an execution plan, and then aligns with their manager on that plan to achieve all they want/expect from their time at the company."
good,"Had fun at Microsoft. Smart people and excellent tools."
good,The place was a great working experience professionally has were taken to trainings regularly to learn more about the company and the product offering.
good,"It was a competitive or even cut-throat place when I was there. I hear it's changed since then."
good,"I started my day with emails. The workers often forgot badges so I would make new ones for them. Another part of the job is scheduling meeting rooms. A tough part of the job is when multiple parties need similar rooms. The food on campus is great. Take time during your lunch or after work to explore the campus, it's beautiful."
good,"Let me begin by explaining that our team was in a contract with Microsoft, therefore we were not engineers and this sort of thing is typical in the tech industry. Our normal day-to-day was in social media support. We were expected to reach 60+ tweets or Facebook posts a day to help customers with their Windows OS experience as well as finding solutions to their problems after they had installed the new Windows operating system. We were given an email every day if something had changed and we were no longer allowed to engage certain customers, or how we were supposed to respond if a situation was updated. For example, if they were aware of a particular issue, we had a set template to use to respond to worried customers. "
good,vsechno dobre ale neni vubec pracovni jistota a veci se zmeny moc rychle
good,They respected work/life balance because I was a contractor. My project seemed in chaos because they were working towards overly optimistic goals. Management at the upper levels seemed unconnected to what was happening on the ground.
good,"There are a lot of talented and diverse people working at Microsoft."
good,"Great place, made a lot of connections and learned alot. However, some Microsoft employees treated us contractors like 2nd class employees due to Contractor status. Having an 'Orange Badge' is almost like a handicap around certain persons that feel over entitled. I did complete a full workload more consistently than my peers that were fully vested Microsoft Employees."
good,"O clima e o trabalho são ótimos, no entanto, as possibilidades de promoção não são boas."
good,"o Work for six years running. The growth, innovation, and Aloha spirit of Salesforce are driven by our incredible employees who thrive on delivering success for our customers while also finding time to give back through our 1/1/1 model, which leverages 1% of our time, equity, and product to improve communities around the world. Salesforce is a team sport, and we play to win. Join us!"
good,Working for Microsoft was a great learning environment.  I learn a lot about different operating systems. This job was my first introduction to SMS/SCCM.
good,"Probably the most valuable thing about working at Microsoft is exposure to some of the smartest and most highly qualified people I've ever encountered. In general they were incredibly generous with their time, mentorship and teaching."
good,"it all started when I knew I could help out the Kinect team with my background in animation. It was a long fun journey as I grew from a labeler to a QA to Lead QA, to more rewarding job duties. I got to meet and work with a great team."
good,"Involved in international assignments and met cross cultured people. Had the chance to lead team without direct authority and have big impact in emerging markets."
good,"Depending on what team you're on and who your manager is, your day/week/year might look very different. The online advertising side of the company is very young whereas the cloud/productivity side of the company is more seasoned."
good,"Overall, Microsoft is a great company, as long as you have a very clear personal goal, and understand what it takes for career advancement.  Those who know exactly what they want to do, do well, but those who are unclear of their goals, struggle."
good,it was the most work ever did but the culture the people and how well Microsoft takes care of their employees is more than I've seen for many other companies.
good,"Strong benefits package."
good,"Very rewarding and ability to learn consistently. New technologies almost weekly, never the same thing made the job interesting and enjoyable. Good times!"
good,"Extremely helpful people with good ""group cohesion"" and communication. Fast paced and interesting, with role having a significant impact on product release. Learned a great deal about mass production manufacturing and the value of applying systematic approaches and attention to detail at all times."
good,"Microsoft is a great company to work for! Lots of intelligent, driven people, listening to customers, crafting products and driving into the future. Highly recommend."
good,"Productive and fun workplace, people are very helpful, people are very friendly. The working environment was great at the site. If I had the chance will work at Microsoft Corporation again."
good,Great company and great innovation and felt we had a lot of input on decisions and direction on our teams. I was fortunate to have great managers who treated people with respect.
good,If you are interested in changing the world than Microsoft is a great place to work at and grow your career.  As you gain more seniority it becomes much more difficult to gain additional promotions and more senior positions.
good,"over all everything is pretty amazing. "
good,"Great place to work if you can avoid the teams that are very political, just BS and slack. There is no limit on what you can learn and the access, trainings and mentorship to all the tech stack developed internally."
good,"Ambiente multidisciplinar en el que trabajas con grupos de diferentes áreas, departamentos y países, por lo que profesionalmente te ayuda a aprender y tener diferentes criterios y puntos de vista."
good,"Lot of learning opportunities, and challenges available to learn from. Good mix of interesting projects and innovative hack opportunities. Fun work culture"
good,I've spent 17 years at Microsoft.  It's been an amazing place to work with great benefits.  Over the years it has gotten more cut throat and stressful but you get paid well for what you do.
good,Low innovation rate. Perfect for married people who want to settle into their lives with a comfortable workplace and salary. The company pampers you a lot. Very few times when I felt like I was doing something for the betterment of the people around me. Fewer politics than most Indian companies.
good,"Microsoft is great place to work. Nice environment friendly team members and nice office setups. "
good,"My experience was good. But in general at Microsoft it depends on a team. "
good,"Very fast paced environment on a daily basis with calendar scheduling, meetings and event planning, make travel arrangements/coordination (domestic and international).  I also ordered hardware and supplies on a daily basis, onboarding new hires and vendors. The work culture is diverse, and enjoyed working with all cultures as a team, which was my most favorite aspect of the job."
good,"on a typical day we get anywhere between 6-25 cases a day."
good,"A place full of smart people trying to make an impact on the world. I always tell new employees that if you can imagine it, you can likely do it at Microsoft."
good,"Microsoft Retail was a great opportunity and I would absolutely suggest someone working there. if you were let's say in high school or in college, it is not a career environment though."
good,"It is really enjoyable working here at Microsoft. The teammates and colleagues across the company is very helpful. I have learned a lot of technical skills pertaining to SharePoint as well as soft skills while working at Microsoft. Workplace culture is friendly and welcoming for newcomers. The hardest part of the job was being at on call duty for 24/7 for a week by rotation which is also rewarding given the fact that engineers had a chance to solve real customer problems which helped them a lot with their understanding of the large project like sharepoint, Most enjoyable part is the freedom and ability to work on new components and availability of abundant resources to work with as well as the ping pong table and retro-games to play with co-workers"
good,Microsoft is really a hit or miss. There are some great teams within the company where you can work on cool technology and tons of smart people. There are also some teams (e.g. Windows) where the team is too large and take forever to get anything done due to the multiple layers of management and politics.
good,my days where busy and i learned a lot working here the people where friendly and very helpful also a very fast paised work place which it kept me busy.
good,"This company develops you!  The opportunity to work for smart and people driven leaders is tremendous.  Stretch assignments, recognition and personal/career development is in their DNA."
good,"The workplace culture at Microsoft is wonderful. "
good,"Turning point and start of a new career opportunity.Met a lot of great people,had a lot of fun and inspired to continue and be my most awesome thanks to the great staff on board"
good,"Great company, fostering the learning and growth of employees. There are lot of career opportunities if you build the right network. With the new focus on Cloud and mobile experiences, there is a learning curve for everyone across disciplines, but it is definitely heading in the right direction."
good,"Good working environment, but too much top-down decisions"
good,"Great work-environment and work-life balance but ensure you are on a high visibility project which is funded well and has stakeholder support. There are several projects that get ""killed"" because they did not have funding and so cutting the team becomes the imminent next step for the company"
good,"Microsoft is a great place to work.  It's a very family friendly place.  If you are lucky to get to the Principal level at Microsoft, then life is great, with good compensation, excellent benefits"
good,"It really depends on which team you are working on, also managers have big see in your career unless you takes actions promptly, but I saw many new grads failed into false-safe situation until too late."
good,"Công ty với nhiều tiềm năng để phát triển và trau dồi bản thân hơn trong công việc.  Môi trường làm việc sạch sẽ, thoáng mát"
good,Microsoft is an great company that gives tons a benefits and is a good culture with the right group and boss.   I believe that Microsoft is one of the best companies to work for as long as you have bosses that are good.
good,"Although I only worked at the Microsoft Online Store for a short period of time, I was exposed to office settings within the work world and gained a better understanding of business culture overall."
good,"My 2 years as a contracted employee at Microsoft was an overall positive experience. While there are a lot of very intelligent and driven people, skilled management, and fantastic leadership, there is a culture of over-protectiveness over job roles which makes projects more difficult to complete than necessary."
good,"O dia a dia da L4U é muito leve devido ao bom relacionamento dentro da agência, pessoas bem humoradas e muito respeitosas. Mesmo com um fluxo dinâmico de trabalho, o ambiente facilita que o seu dia seja tranquilo."
good,"While the company is working to speed-up the business, most of the teams still got to do heavy politics to have anything moving forward."
good,"日常在各大電器店推銷產品, 因而接觸到很多不同種類的客人, 對於面對不同客人相應的應對技巧會有顯著提升。"
good,"One of the great work environments with independence to choose your individual career paths."
good,"the hardest part is to get the raw data, not technically, you want. So stay motivated, stay positive, and step out of your comfort zone in communication."
good,"Good benefit but relatively low salary compared to other high tech companies. Bad company culture, careless about employees. Really depending on the team and managers"
good,"Amazingly smart people trying to change the culture to be more innovative.  Middle management is more protective of their jobs, than interested in the advancement of the next generation.  Unfortunate."
good,Great work place culture. Community volunteer work is encouraged and get paid doing it.   The offices provide free energy drinks and good coffee/tea options.
good,"Possibilité de travailler sur des projets variés te grande valorisation des initiatives. "
good,You are challenged everyday to grow yourself and the business.  Great compensation and benefits. Culture is competitive but rewarding. Enjoyed my time here.
good,This is a tele-sales position that involves constantly changes metrics and goals. You can't find a group of more competitive and excited coworkers elsewhere. I gained sales skills while honing my communication skills and worked to constantly improve not only the quality of my leads being passed but the overall quality of my work.
good,Great work environment. You get to work on cool technologies. Benefits are very good. Management is fair but all major decisions are made in the U.S. Reviews are very tough.
good,"It was a great experience because you work alongside top professionals and learn a lot of things in a long paced environment. It is a good opportunity to discover different kind of businesses."
good,"Great company to work for. Options to relocate and move up. Everyday is a new challenge. Great culture. Great learning experiences. Good benefits, could use better discounts"
good,"I have about 6 more months to go on an 18-month contract as a Vendor Consultant, and i have truly enjoyed working with all of the team members I have had the opportunity to work with.  They are bright, creative, fun and very practical in their approach to collaboration and problem-solving."
good,"Working in Microsoft is challenging yet fun. Currently I manage 9 countries in APAC region, that includes Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam. While, I also do assist on setting up SEA NM region remotely from HQ. "
good,"it was great place to work considering it was retail mall hours, but besides that I have had great experience working there."
good,"Project Management Intern"
good,good experience in team work &  enjoy work place good management managing the man power schedule i have learned vendor co ordination smooth communication with employee
good,"Microsoft is a wonderful place to work, with an amazing work/life balance. I wish there were more full time roles available, as I am sad to be looking for a new position once my contract is over."
good,Great company to work for. I enjoyed assisting customer with their blackberry troubleshooting issues. The company provided food and different team building experiences that help agents succeed in the work place.
good,"My view of Microsoft is that it is a great company to work for, though, the work/life balance to can be off due to very large projects."
good,"Great job that demands high energy."
good,"Working in Microsoft IT (we touched ALL businesses, internal and external) was extremely satisfying and very challenging. Very challenging in the fact that we had to balance business x's needs against business y's needs all with a finite budget."
good,"Microsoft IT, is a place to learn while on work, great ambiance, provides ample opportunities for Growth, built on great values"
good,"Microsoft gave me opportunities to learn many things which helped me grow as a person. I appreciate the efforts that some of my managers put into interpersonal development for the team I worked on."
good,"Overall, good compensation and work-life balance.  It is in transformational stage, lots of uncertainties and negative stress at times."
good,I had many opportunities for growth and development while at Microsoft for 15 years.  I managed teams and other managers; partnered with law firms and other venders;  helped develop and  implement new databases; and actively worked to reduce overall costs for prosecuting patents.  It was interesting and rewarding work.
good,"Very casual work environment, free drinks and snacks etc. Lovely campus, and discount on lunch. Employees however have to watch their backs every now and then"
good,"i got best platform where i got explored about the things which i don't know before i got feel typical in this field when i am unable to convince to customer at the time of interaction."
good,Great Brand and door opener. Heavily focussed on Licensing and hence sometimes loses sight of customers needs. Partner dependence is high.
good,"I enjoy working here, however, I am seeking a more challenging position. I am currently in a telesales position with Microsoft. This is a great company, however it quickly becomes very monotonous."
good,"Depending on team and lead, flexible work life balance and hours. Opportunities to learn new products and skills. Team spirit is better now that 'stack ranking' forced curves have been removed from performance evaluations. That old system used to create disincentives to cooperate."
good,"Great opportunity to be entrepreneurial.  Pleasure to work with smart, knowledgable people."
good,"The culture at MS regarding contractors is very long, of course, and the culture has shifted over the years.  When I first started, contractors were second class citizens.  These days?  They are valued members of teams.  MS has come a long way in improving that culture."
good,"It was a wonderful experience working at Microsoft. We have a good dedicated team who help each other in learning new things . We have a good environment, games during weekend , pot lucks and much more fun. We work as a family."
good,Fun work place with quick changes. Employees are willing to help each other. Interesting projects with many good opportunities to learn.
good,"I learned to be extremely efficient and coordinate  and work together with all stakeholders/ team members and deliver excellent results under pressure"
good,"Under the new leadership, Microsoft is evolving and growing once again.  It was slumbering giant under past leadership, but it has awoken with new vigor."
good,"Large organization that promotes networking and fairly frequent job changes.  Work life depends on group, some are better than others, but great benefits and opportunities. Company is going through a lot of changes under new ceo"
good,"Great company - but long hours"
good,While the compensation and job security leave much to be desired the culture at the office and fellow employees make it a great place to work
good,i have enjoyed my job at microsoft because they provideded work and life balance .and salary & benifits very good in microsoft.
good,Got to work with some of the finest teams and learned a lot about performance engineering and testing webpages during this period.
good,Great working environment but very limited on moving up in the company. Great co-workers and I learned a lot from the company.
good,"Worked in Sales Desk, Sales Excellence for over 4 years and I've learned and developed tremendously."
good,"Review issues first thing in the morning. Clear all outstanding issues from previous day, categorize items to be action for the day. With the time at Microsoft I found to handle requests from end user. Create project plans for the test environment, and manage the life cycle of services. My co-worker were helpful if there were issue that needed to be addressed we would work together to resolve the issue. The hardest part of this job was dealing with resource allocation for software testing purposes. The most enjoyable part of this job was helping other achieve their desired results."
good,"If you want to impact people using technology in their lives and work, literally everywhere in the world, Microsoft is the best place to be. If you are entrepreneurial, this is a spirit that jives with the future direction of the company but current engineering culture is still figuring out how to embrace this spirit given the need to maintain and bring forward legacy products and processes. Microsoft is a work in progress, yet again."
good,"Microsoft is a great company to work for, the culture is great, excellent compensation and benefits, enough flexibility for both vertical and horizontal movement. The big issue is individuals can feel irrelevant making small things in the big scope of products."
good,The most enjoyable part of the working here was the awesome team of coworkers. I had the ability and freedom to manage my time and daily tasks yet still have fun. The most difficult part of the occupation was having to multitask while being interrupted.
good,"- Contacting Schools and Institutions to evangelize Windows devices"
good,good pay and overall good place to work. Can e tough to get things done because of the many hoops and ladder.
good,"Generated pipeline opportunities in existing accounts and new market targets among approximately 1,000 named Upper Mid-Market (200 to 1000 PCs) accounts. The focus was growing the Mid-Market accounts that were primarily a select license and or open license to a more cost effective way on saving money and unifying their licenses one platform which is an Enterprise agreement."
good,"Learnt a lot from management and co-workers,that how the productive calls are coverted into sales and motivate the dealers to use and sell licensing and shown them how to earn profits out of it.Management overall was really helpful in all sectors.Most enjoyable part of job was to convert the piracy zone into licensing zone......it really motivated for my future endeavours."
good,It is a great company to work for with lot of technical skills to learn. Great team members.
good,"super arbeitgeber"
good,"A typical day started off with reviewing, sorting, and when needed - respond to over-night emails. In addition to team and company correspondence, they also consisted of automation test results and testing done over-seas. Next, I would review my bugs in the database to see what needed follow-up on for that day. In my last position, we would have a daily scrum to sync up with all our teammates on where we all were in our tasks and goals for the project. This is also where we would make agile decisions on our workforce and re-assign folks or create new tasks to help keep the project on track for its determined release date."
good,Working at MSR India is been an awesome experience where I could work from my heart. Its a best place to learn lot of values in work place. A perfect place to be in where I could balance my professional and personal life.
good,"Direct and Partner management, provide support and direction while increasing revenue and pipeline opportunity. "
good,Microsoft as technology company you have good opportunity to learn technology and open culture help you to become expert.
good,"Microsoft is still driven by the ""grow corporate accounts at any cost"" mentality."
good,"great place to work and the company takes really great care of its employees and its community through charity and things like relieving traffic pollution/congestion through charter bus service. And if you are interested in doing it or learning it, Microsoft has it"
good,Microsoft is an exciting company to work at and the new CEO is making all the right moves to take the company in the direction it needs to go.

good,"•	Demonstrate great customer service"
good,"a good company to work with, employee friendly with relatively good work life balance. However bureaucratic with many layers."
good,Great team! Hardworking and committed to achieving goals. Culturally diverse and fun team events to bring it all together.
good,"empresa dinâmica e diversificada, estruturada, tecnologia de ponta."
good,Nice environment could have been the worlds dream job with better management placement.
good,"multi cultural environment"
good,"Kind and helpful management"
good,"A very good learning experience, with a great corporate culture. The hardest part was a healthy work/life balance."
good,"Casual dress"
good,"Good work life balance, stable, upward mobility not very high, some flaws in the management structure."
good,"I go to local Best Buys and consult the store on the newest Microsoft products, train Best Buy employees, and sell Microsoft products to customers. I've learned a lot of product knowledge at this job. The communication between corporate and the consultants is lacking. My other consultants are professional and very well versed in our products."
good,"Amazing 12 years.   Learned in depth DW, TSQL and whole SQL Stack."
good,"Good company, good culture, free working time. good environment"
good,"Good starter company, has taught me lot of things, salary is good, people get recognized, to my surprise management was good too."
good,"Good work culture Flexible timing, which I always liked. Lot of learning during tenure at MSN."
good,"Es wird viel gefordert aber auch viel gegeben."
good,"Engaged with senior executives to sell IT support services as a solution specialist to Enterprise level customers in order to decrease their TCO and increase the health and efficiencies of their IT infrastructure. I was responsible for identifying, driving and closing complex, strategic sales opportunities. Effectively communicated and worked closely with field sales teams, technical specialist, and partners for sales planning and joint execution, while creating a strategic partnership with the customer. Managed a book of existing business while increasing revenue. Penetrated the white space to bring in the net new business"
good,Everyday starts with new challenges and it is very challenging to resolve many of the complex issue in SQL Server which nobody could resolve. Self study and on the job experience are the biggest asset that I have gained from Microsoft.
good,"Currently working for the Microsoft Client “Amgen” (California), project being IRPC, a MS Dynamics CRM 2011 project, which is based on the .NET framework & developed in C#."
good,"Interesting starting a Microsoft Practice in a slower moving environment.  Again, they tended t get in there own way by not being able to allow individual prodictivity."
good,"need to study based on document"
good,"Mosaic Sales Solutions is a huge company that is growing. They work with some of the biggest retailers in the business including Walmart, Samsung, Microsoft etc."
good,"Not bad, I was a contractor, very different from a FTE. Can't tell how is it is for FTE."
good,"I worked four ten hour shifts as an employee for HP working in a Microsoft owned data center. The pay was great and the job was fun and enjoyable. Although it was a graveyard shift job, the shift differential and co-workers made it very enjoyable. I highly recommend working here."
good,- Process Oriented Organization
good,"For a software company, Microsoft adopts very little software to run its and coordinate its internal teams and orgs."
good,A lot of challenges and extremely hard ramp up but good company
good,-assist customer understand TV products and assist iun decision making
good,Management and other team staff were very respectful to your place on the staff and were very low pressure on most projects. This allowed me to take some extra time to do things right without the high pressures of over-demanding deadlines.
good,In working at Microsoft you are among the best and brightest in the technology industry. The hardest part about the work is staying ahead of the information to be able to lead your customers in the right direction. Technology is constantly changing and training was a weekly event just to stay up with the latest information.
good,"This was a contract position, which lasted 3 months. However, I had a great time working at Microsoft with many intelligent people."
good,"A typical day at work was checking the email sent overnight, handling any problem or request that needed an immediate attention. Check my workload for any new studies sent my way and coordinate my day on which study i will call on to fill. I learned more how to time manage better with detailed deadlines as well as learn how to recruit by phone on finding specifics based on a number of traits. I learned a little bit more about Excel. Management was okay there. There was an open door policy so anything i wanted to share or ask, someone was there to help out. Co-workers on my team were very supportive, we definitely were a team there supporting each other. They were fun to socialize and work with. Hardest part of the job was finding people with a very strict and specific trait that didn't want to participate or weren't available. The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling of filling a study to capacity, the occasional free food brought by the team and working with my co-workers."
good,"Worked there in 95, it was fun, enjoyable and at times crazy. The staff and management work well together"
good,Responsible for setting your own yearly goals and working with managers to achieve them.
good,Main job requirements are communicating with customers via email and drafting license agreements through an automated system.
good,"Working as a contractor to Microsoft varies depending on the host company. Once inside working with Microsoft, you are part of the internal team. I am in Microsoft Premier Services selling services to Partners and having a great time. I opened 19 new accounts this year which is a record for this group."
good,"Great people, and large projects. The hardest part of the job is taking on any new challenges yourself. Most manager are overworked and have very little time to provide guidance"
good,Good company to work for with great benefits and interesting work.
good,"Microsoft has been a great place to work because of the learning opportunities, leadership experience, and innovative projects and initiatives."
good,"Great benefits. However, the performance review process creates an unhealthy atmosphere and culture."
good,"You can make it what it is. At times, there's more internal brand management needed than your actual day to day job. The people are great, and you can learn a lot if you want to. Not for people who want to coast for a paycheck."
good,"The typical work day was your average technical support experience. Go in, take calls, fix customers Xbox consoles and troubleshoot network or hardware issues over the phone for a while, take a brief lunch, take more calls, and then go home. I didn't mind the monotony because the workplace was friendly and the management was top-notch. Every so often you'd have a call that wouldn't go as planned based off the tools you were given to solve it. But there was always a silver lining in knowing that the issue was going to be fixed by the end of the call regardless whether or not the customer believed it. I enjoyed working there and would have continued working there if not for a relocation in area."
good,As a vendor I was granted visibility into different facets of the business and the culture of the company. Great way to learn what path one would like to take in their career.
good,"Day at work: Design, Coding, Meeting, Scrum"
good,"Pros:"
good,Enjoy working with some of the great minds from best colleges across the country.Work life balance is got.Pay is little under par compared to competitors.
good,Very friendly and helpful people. Casual dress code.Very fast pace and complex environment. Information can be difficult to find as the product (Azure) is chancing on a regular basis.
good,This was by far the easiest and fun to do job. Setting up consoles in big retailers such as Makro to name a few for kids and adults to experience playing on the new Xbox one console
good,Hard work but rewarded well. IC paths as valuable as managerial. Lots of lateral growth and some of best benefits on the planet.  Don’t be scared by bad press!
good,Microsoft is a great company. Benefits are top notch but the pay isn’t. Coworkers are nice. It can get very competitive at times but most are always willing to help. Ample training and support. Great management
good,Lots to learn -- too many acronyms and irrelevant not up to date distribution lists. easy commute from home. nice facility. friendly folks to work with.
good,"I was a retail employee involved in sales, training, b2b, planogram,inventory and working with the CDS. Although great experience I was pulled in many different directions and didn’t think I was mastering one special area."
good,Very well crafted design team with data driven design process. Reorgs happens too often so be prepared for changes happening every now and then. Good work life balance.
good,"Flexible working hours, result-driven, fast-paced environment."
good,Tiene voz y voto con tus jefes (pero eso creo que es mas por ser en Inglaterra) y te cuidan como empleado mucho.
good,"I worked through a staffing agency at Microsoft of which they call a vendor.  I saw many vendors come and go because they don't hire vendors once the 18-month contract is up.  Great job until you find a permanent opportunity but there are no medical, dental, holiday or sick pay.  Microsoft does offer free training."
good,"Most folks who worked within Microsoft know that it's a job simply speaking to your co-workers.  Without getting too detailed, just know that you should be confident in your skill, and know-how to manage upwards"
good,Great place to work overall. You work with a lot of smart and amazing individuals and opportunities to learn new skills are almost endless.  Workflow can be chaotic at times but the challenge is totally worth the overall experience.
good,"Microsoft under Satya Nadella is a transformed company on a roll. Lots of positives, but still some vestiges of the old days (politics, bad review culture."
good,Microsoft is a great place to work with opportunities to explore different domains and technologies. Work life balance is good and the benefits are pretty good.
good,"Excellent culture, amazing company, limited career path unless you can move to Washington. The benefits are top notch, the relationships you build will last a lifetime and they truly do love what they do."
good,"I have been worked as Facility Shift engineer for 3.5 years"
good,"It's a big company.  A lot of politics and churn as the company figures out the next steps.  However, once it figures out a plan, it executes very well.  Your mileage will depend on the team."
good,"Loved going to work every day but there was no room to grow. Even when I was hitting top numbers and giving excellent customer service, there was no room to move up. Upsetting because I wanted to make Microsoft my life time career in the higher level fields"
good,"The workplace is quite exciting and fun with positive energy. I was lucky to have some helpful people around me. "
good,It was a pleasure and a privileged to work at Microsoft. I learnt a great deal there. The standards are exacting and clients demanding but that gets the best out of the experience.
good,An excellent company with great benefits and work life balance. Pay is average and so is the management. The ability to grow in the company is quite difficult.
good,"Systematic evaluation of our contributions "
good,"From a consumer electronics side, each customer had unique needs that can be challenging to address.  It was our task to find and craft how Microsoft products could fill the need for the individual.  This would vary from a single consumer, all the way up to corporations looking for out of the box methods."
good,"You never know if and when your job will be eliminated. It was a constant fear every 6 months. So stability is questioned. Once your entire division is let go without notice, you find out it is very common. Once you are out it is very hard to get back in."
good,I worked at Microsoft as a contractor and even though I was a contractor I was treated with a great deal of consideration and respect.  I was well trained for my position and I was very pleased with my time there.
good,Microsoft feels like a family & was a truly enjoyable place to work. My time there was some my most memorable. Outside of the Military I've never had  quite an experience at a work place.
good,"Not a bad place to work, pros and cons like any other job. Good workers and site manager. Very disciplined. Hours can be long. Pay is pretty decent, could be a more for the amount of work and responsibility demanded."
good,"Microsoft acquired the startup I worked for and immediately showed faith in me by giving me a large promotion and  a whole new set of responsibilities."
good,It's a great environment to work in and Microsoft seems to value their employees very much. There is also room for growth and advancement with various training and certifications available.
good,"With the ever changing Office 365 suite, this is a great place to constantly have to learn new things.  The ability to help people understand what SharePoint is and how to best use it is a great thing.  Facing constant changing challenges on a daily basis as no two businesses like to do the same thing."
good,Microsoft offers a variety of opportunities for people who want to expand their career.  Microsoft gave me an opportunity to gain valuable skills. I found the job rewarding and challenging.
good,"Microsoft was a great place to work, but it really depended on the group you were in.  So long as the group was aligned with corporate culture, it was fantastic, but to the extent individuals were out for self promotion, it was not a cooperative workplace and became very political.  I had a great 17 years, but never would have stayed that long had I determined a better career path."
good,"On y retrouve une ambiance de start-up. Tout le monde se tutoie. "
good,Provided senior level desktop support at  Microsoft. I was promoted to be a member of a team called TRIO. This team was a collaboration of Microsoft and Entex employees that worked on issues that could not be resolved by our frontline site support team. This was a challenging and interesting position.
good,"You can be successful at Microsoft, you just have to understand you are going to work with some of the smartest people in the world on bleeding edge technological problems - you have to be highly motivated to get 1% better EVERY SINGLE DAY."
good,"Fácil manera de trabajar, tienen muy en cuenta la vida familiar fuera del trabajo."
good,"I love working at Microsoft--my boss is relaxed, we have a fun team, and I'm paid well for the work that I do. My hours are flexible, as I work from home most of the time, and the events that I run are very fun. The only issue that I have is that i'm a contractor and there is very little knowledge or education given as to how to break out of that role and find something full-time. From what I can see, most teams just reorder themselves to fill spaces or take on interns at a lower cost with less experience. I'd love to work full-time here...i'm just not sure how."
good,MS Advertising was a solid sales organization for most of it's existence.  Microsoft has given sales responsibilities to Oath (Verizon) now and does not have a true sales org.
good,"It is a great company but it is very big and complex now. This is the company that you can stay for many years.  You can easily change jobs to jobs. When you work in a different group, it can be like  working in a completely different place."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Microsoft, further developing my stakeholders engagement skills as well as my direct sourcing expertise on quite a wide range of both individual contributor roles and leadership/people management roles across EMEA. I have learnt to be a better business trusted advisor, by asking good questions, actively listening, showing genuine interest in the business, using empathy and growth mindset. I have also reinforced my coaching skills with my stakeholders."
good,"Very good benefits (401K with above average matching, vacation, health insurance, sick leave, and many others) , very hard working and talented colleagues and management."
good,"Msft is a very good employer with great benefits and opportunities for career growth if you're favorable viewed in the political arena, which is important for advancement along with other criteria."
good,i have got good opportunity to work and learn lot more during the work and culture and atmosphere and also improved a lot while working with this prestigious organisation.
good,"I think with any company you will have a love hate relationship with different aspects of your job.  I was lucky enough to be in a role where i could interact with dozens of different customers every month to assist with solving some very easy but most very difficult problems.  I would recommend everyone to try out MFST, only you can know if it is the write fit for you."
good,"Great Place to work... They just don't have FTE slots for my kind of role.   One of the Best managers peeps I have had in a long time."
good,"Always challenge and fast moving"
good,As an intern at Microsoft I was assigned to work that was quite similar to what a full time employee would have done. The sky seems to be the limit as to what you can do while there and the odds of being hired on seem very high if you show promise. Might have bad manager but you can transfer to different manager like fellow interns had to do.
good,Overall good place to work. Culture is both collaborative and competitive. Great benefits. Management hierarchy is layered which can lead to heavy bureaucracy.
good,Working on some famous games at Microsoft was fun and rewarding.  The teams were cohesive and hired the best artists and programmers.  I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
good,Each day can bring a new adventure and it is all about attitude and collaboration to get it done. Microsoft really values the growth mindset and encourages each employee to own what they do and complete it with the best interest of the customer in mind.
good,"Our team was tasked with maintaining 10-12 SCOM instances for several mission-critical teams doing cutting-edge development."
good,Microsoft is a company that wants to create an environment that allows employees to do their best work. The want employees to find deep meaning in their work.
good,No red flags working for Microsoft. As long as you know your job or are eager to learn or take on new opportunities from within your sub organization the culture and management are on your side. Goldbrickers need to look elsewhere.
good,You get to learn a lot of new technologies if you are assigned good projects. People are generally helpful. Great work will be rewarded. Fun environment.
good,"Great place to learn, to be challenged every day. Never stop working on new topics. Highly professional team mates. Good place to know different countries and cultures."
good,Great company with unlimited opportunities but currently job security is lower due to the cloud transformation process and ongoing reorganizations within the company
good,"I worked at MSFT for almost 13 years.  One thing about MSFT is that you move roles a lot and change managers even more. Change is part of the culture.  And so are the opportunities.  I was able to move into very fun, challenging roles.  I do not remember a boring day there."
good,"There is a ton of work to do and very poor documentation/training on how to do it. "
good,Very good company if you are not looking for start-up atmosphere. Since it's out there for so long you know what to expect and not much is changing. Good work-life balance
good,Overall management was flexible due to commute windows and additional time due to working with international business partners.  Worked with several teams and each team is different along with each manager.  Had the pleasure of working with great team members and managers.
good,"Microsoft has been one of the better companies I’ve ever worked for. The hours where good and pay was great also being part of the Xbox team was pretty fun, but there is always a problem within every company and Microsoft’s was the work environment. Let me explain, your co-workers are great people who will toss you under the buss or stab you in the back if it means advancing or avoiding trouble and the managers all seem to have their favorite person. If you can stand a cutthroat corporate environment then you should have no trouble at Microsoft."
good,"Buena estructuración del equipo. "
good,Good company with lots of opportunity to move around.  Some really good leaders but poor middle management and the old review process meant lots of good people pushed out for the wrong reasons.
good,"Its good retail, still need a basic understanding of computers but that is taught to you during training. Everything else is common sense and just asking questions versus assuming."
good,"Worked here in a contract role. Great company, as many already know. It's just really hard (near impossible unless you know or you're best friends with the higher ups) to convert from contractor to FTE."
good,"Great place to work, great people and culture.  Could be stressful but that was to be expected during certain deliverables. Fast paced, but wonderful benefits and work/life balance."
good,"Microsoft bietet eine hochdynamische Arbeitsumgebung in einem Markt mit sehr hohem Wachstumspotential. Hier kann sich jeder selbst entfalten und seinen Job zu einem großen Maße selbst gestalten, solange er/sie die definierten Ziele am Ende des Jahres erreicht. Hierarchien sind flach, so daß man von jeder Stelle aus viel bewegen kann, wenn man andere von seinen Ideen überzeugen kann. "
good,"Microsoft at the time was a very challenging, quick paced, nimble environment. During my tenure, I experienced nine reorganizations within six years. Each management team had a different view of how my team should operate. It was the incredibly long hours over many years that led to my departure. I felt well paid and respected."
good,"Microsoft was a highly competitive work environment filled with extremely bright and gifted people.  It was obsessed with innovation, rapid growth and expansion.  It was an awesome roller coaster ride that required an enormous amount of commitment and passion to survive."
good,"good work environment, close and nice relation with colleagues, plenty of extra-curriculum activities, nice and friendly leaders, smart and nice geeks around"
good,"Been a long time ago, but while I was there it was a very fast paced and very informative career. Many outstanding people, knowledgeable, kind, forthright, energetic and so much more. Few things were handled at a comfortable pace. For some people this can be more fun, but for others it can be overwhelming. The other negative is the risk of errors and problems stemming from the inability to apply adequate time to ferreting out issues."
good,"The staff was always supportive and assisted whenever required.  The pay was always on time and there was an abundance of training classes available.  There were classes available on a multitude of currently required skills, during multiple hours that would fit any schedule."
good,"Fun filled job."
good,"Being a vendor at Microsoft you are treating close to the same as the FTE's.  They have great cafeterias and offer free infused water, coconut water, coffee, pop, tea, and lots more."
good,"Great working with so many smart, creative, dedicated, collaborative people."
good,"Công ti có môi trường làm việc lành mạnh"
good,"Its a great company to work for. Opportunity to learn, grow and switch teams as required. Salary and benefits are above average with the current industry standards."
good,Get to work with some of the smartest folks. Great learning and productive environment. Management very lenient which results in decreased/slower project outputs.
good,"was always enjoying the work, learned more patience, no job stress, there was never like hardest part in my job as i feel, also learned much computer knowledge more."
good,"Would love to work again."
good,"Being a product adviser it was always fun to greet customers and distinguish exactly which computer, laptop, tablet, phone, etc. would best suit them. Microsoft made sure each of their employees were properly trained on not only the Office software but as well as specific brands of products and even trained to learn quite a bit about the XBox Console. Daily there would be seminars run not only in front of the stores location but as well as inside on an immaculate 103 ft. screen which would always impress customers. Microsoft really provided its employees with quite a bit; from great benefits, to food catering, product knowledge, and even simply being able to use all of the computers and gaming systems for learning purposes. The hardest part would easily be that while working there it was difficult to be busy when there weren't any customers in the summer season, days would often feel long. Management was generally informative and supportive of their team, even going as far as to having morning stretch and warm-up routines, making sure everyone is treated fairly and taking breaks/lunches on time."
good,"Great place to work with exposure to working in a global community, due to the sheer size of the company it can be challenging to be impactful and raise your profile in the company however it is still exciting place to work as the company pushes forward quick with new products."
good,Microsoft is a great company to work with.  They provide good working environment and work life balance.  There are enough opportunities for lateral growth and movement.
good,"great place to work . good work life balance."
good,"Microsoft can be whatever you would like it to be in a career. With a few exceptions. The only one of these that became an important one for me is that you should ever fall in love with a given job. Keep moving, keep changing."
good,"The focus changes so often you do not know where to look next. They need to figure out who they want to be and stick to it. Otherwise, this job can be a lot of fun!"
good,A great company for folks full of energy.  A great experience for someone who would like to work in the fast paced tech word.  The 24/7 world of data centers is very demanding and full of multi-tasking
good,"I was spoiled in that I was able to work on the Xbox team at Microsoft. In the team I was focused on the software / os side in test. Everyday presented new challenges, interaction with others, collaboration for better products, opportunity to learn more about programming / testing."
good,Microsoft is definitely one of the best companies to work with. It has perfect work life balance and gives enough liberty to employees to work as per their style.
good,"Microsoft has so many amazing people and ideas to offer but they get caught up in which direction they want to go. I was in field sales and felt there was a lot of dysfunction at the corporate level due to the year promotion and objective process. Every 12 months corporate employees had to move to a new position in order to increase their pay.  So every year the entire division had to relearn lessons that were learned the year before. This had a huge impact on field personal and customers, as well as roadmap and competitiveness."
good,"Microsoft is a good company to work as it has a good work culter and good environment, as well as fun activities available for employee like outdoor games as well as indoor games."
good,"Microsoft Corporation is a great place to work. You can expect everyone to be focused, as effective as possible (with way too much to do), and enthusiastic. "
good,Microsoft has great work life balance. But I feel it a slow paced. Though the environment is changing. The growth rate seems slow to insider. But overall a god place to work
good,"Coffee and a morning scrum started the day at Microsoft.  "
good,"Overall, good company but limited growth potential and lack of innovation. Politics are a big issue. Difficult to break into senior manager without personal relationships."
good,"Assolutamente ambiente di lavoro perfetto, purtroppo in un paese dove non riesco a sentirmi a ""casa"""
good,"I really enjoyed my experience in ""Microsoft town"" in Redmond. I loved that there were so many experienced and smart people I could learn from and ask for advice. On the other hand, among so many people one can feel a little lost and it can be challenging or difficult to make your hard work visible and appreciated."

This mature company offers the structure and training one would expect from a world class brand of its size. Much depends on the culture of the group you join and how good your manager is, but overall working at Microsoft is a good deal. They also embrace flexible working arrangements."
good,"Awesome place to grow your career, but much harder to do if you're not on the main campus in Redmond, or one of the main campuses like NERD, SVC, etc."

Perhaps the most unique aspect of the workplace is the emphasis we place on social responsibility and giving back to the community.
good,"Pros:"
good,"Overall, I had a great experience at Microsoft.  Great teams, great work, relaxed work environment.  I started on a contract with a limited scope of responsibilities, but they saw that I could do more so I was regularly given more responsibilities and projects which really made the work interesting."
good,"Great place to work for the self-driven, offering competitive pay and flexible hours. There are literally a hundred directions you can take your career in, but the programs to promote career paths are murky at best. If you are fresh out of college, you'll be hand-held to success. If you are older, you're on your own. Equal opportunity employer with very diverse teams, and while nice to see, there are the typical stereo-type roles we all seem to play there in the end."
good,"Très bonne boite, je recommande. A faire au moins une fois dans sa vie. A refaire sans hésitation. "
good,"very good atmosphere, coworker and satisfactory job.,"
good,"I worked at MS for nearly 10 years.  My only real complaint is that certain managers fail to fully embrace the real cultural changes driven from the top.  They tend to remain part of the 'old guard' and it can make working there miserable.  If you don't have one these managers, it's a fun, great place to work."
good,Being able to pick which hours you want to come in on which days and how many hours you would like to do on the given day and the no restricting work environment where you are able to be yourself.

good,"It is an amazing environment.Great management, Wonderful co-workers.The hardest part when you deal with VIP employees ."
good,"Microsoft retail is a great place to work if you are looking to really make a name for yourself in retail.  I many ways, it is just like another retail job but things are handled considerably better than other retailers.  Communication is good.  Benefits are excellent.  Pay is fair.  The consistency of goals makes for some stress as targets are always moving but if you enjoy new situations and reacting accordingly, it's nice.  Middle management, like any retailer, is always the crutch.  There is always a disconnect between the people running the show, and when objectives arrive at your store.  There was always a disconnect too with Microsoft as a whole.  What we did in retail seemed insignificant when compared to the greater company.  I loved my coworkers.  I loved my store.  I was expecting more but at the end of the day, it is still retail."
good,Monthly reporting and creating purchase orders has been a large part of the time I have spent at Microsoft. Variance analysis and creating  PowerPoint slides and pivot tables also was required.

good,"Always challenging work with great reward"
good,From time to time work life balance is hard to achieve in Microsoft. but management treat it very seriously if that is called out outstanding in internal MS Survey. In general the company has culture to support its employee to reach their potential. Fairly good medical and dental benefit though not as good as it used to be.
good,"Good Work/Life Balance."
good,I worked with a great team of people. I loved the team I was on although I found the work environment to be somewhat stressful due to unclear expectations and unrealistic deadlines from higher management.
good,"Microsoft was a blast to work for.  They have great benefits and the culture is great to.  Fast paced work environment where we worked hard, but we also got to step back and take a break and play hard as well."
good,I greatly enjoyed my time at Microsoft.  The people there are top notch and technically brilliant.  The company has great resources and very interesting technology.  I was originally working with Microsoft Research which during my time there was shut down with no advanced warning.  This seemed a bit too heavy handed. I was transferred to a product team and became the only person from my original group to retain employment.  Less than a year later I was present for yet another reorg where all of the consultants (myself included) were let go.  Chalk it up to good/bad luck.  I would still not hesitate to recommend Microsoft as an employer.

good,"i used to work on my own although i was a part of a big team."
good,"No day was ever the same, a fast paced results focused environment. I learned the importance of technology in making life and work - WORK. Keeping the team a priority (I worked in the Retail division) for each customer experience. Finally, Operational excellence and functional expertise are always your keys to success."
good,"IBM is the company that built a lot of the professional technical and sales talents."

good,"Microsoft is a great company and great place to hone your IT skills; good pay and good benefits."
good,I really enjoy the atmosphere and culture of the group I am in. The only real downside is being a vendor.
good,"This was by far the best place I have ever worked. The people were great and I was instantly part of a family. I learned that I had more to offer than just office skills. My Manager told me that he would have liked to see me as a Project Manager for the company, however i didn't have any experience so that didn't work in my favor. I wouldn't trade this experience for anything. They believed in each other and myself and compensated well."
good,"productive, co-operative and learning. Flexible hours, wide range of infrastructure, relaxing work environment."
good,"It would be very exciting working with top talents in your daily work and havig chance to touch the top high tech in the world which could change people's life. Although the re-org hurt the company a little, it still can find its way."
good,"Management staff are really involved with employees, and very approachable for improvements or ideas."
good,"Microsoft is something like the wild West: there isn't much emphasis on training or planning. You need to figure things out and then sell people on your concept. This leads to a fair amount of political wrangling and inefficiency, but it can also be an opportunity for someone who combines drive and good ideas with a dose of luck."
good,"Assist and educate customers as well as potential customers on a daily basis"
good,A fun environment to work in with tons of free resources available to everyone
good,"Will provide later about all these"

good,"Mobile PFE, which means I don't actually get to work in any Microsoft facilities. "
good,Overall it's been a good experience at a company that's attempting to secure a viable future.  Still up in the air if this transition can be made and it's interesting to work on projects which help this cause.
good,"Being contracted, a consultant, and a vendor, my experience has been an interesting one. Typically hours of work are pretty flexible, the co-workers are always hard working and hospitable. My day has always been varied in experience due to the nature of the projects I've been involved in. The hardest part of my job is always the viability of the work, too many times upper management reorganizes the team/division/department and projects are completely changed (to a less important task) or altogether ended. There is a very big issues when it comes to aligning management with those below. Leading to a lot of side projects and workarounds outside the view of the team work items."
good,"A fast moving place to work, learn tons of information about hardware and software. Coworkers are friendly, approachable, accessible and most importantly willing to teach you along your learning curve. Time management is key and overall emotional intelligence as technology constantly brings challenges that will need the best of your efforts. "

good,"A typical day at work includes providing 'mild to heavy' administrative support to the management staff and store associates. Managing the Back of House operations of the store ie. product procurement, ordering store supplies and spare equipment, customer phone support, shipping and receiving, and inventory control. I learned that time management is key in my role as an Inventory Control Expert. The hardest part of the job is completing the amount of tasks that can accumulate in a day. I often find my outlook task bar filled up early in the morning. Therefore having a sense of urgency at completing projects and tasks is quite essential. However, Microsoft has many perks working for the software giant certainly means having all the productivity tools at your disposal! And the most enjoyable part of my job is opening and getting the first look at the newest PC models, Windows Phone devices, and the latest and greatest tech accessories (Xbox)! Management and co-workers are great to work with, the stores are relaxed and the phased chill as oppose to other high traffic technology retailer."

good,"I was able to use my skills and experiences at Microsoft."

Learned about visa processing, post offer activities, and gained strong customer service skills by working directly with the applicants.  Always had solid managers who were supportive, knowledgeable, and helped guide our team in the right direction.  The hardest part was just learning how to manage high volumes of data, and making sure to update multiple systems as many of them fed information from one to another.  There's really nothing bad I can say about Microsoft.  I loved working in University Recruiting, everyone including the managers were supportive and helpful, and everyone had a very strong work ethic and positive attitude which really motivated me on a daily basis."

I answer external and internal calls for the entire school district, and must refer callers to the proper person or extension.  My job entails seeing and talking to many people each day, directly them to various areas of the school.  My positon requires that I am alert, pleasant and knowledgeable of what is occurring in the school environment at all times.  I operate a 'background check' system called Raptor, which entails in part, scanning the license of each person who enters the school for security purposes.  In addition, I assist the H.R. department with the hiring of substitute employees, thru giving them a hiring packet to fill out, and explaining the process to them.

New levels are very few and far between, and if you're stuck working with people who don't care, then you're very, very stuck. However, if you get to work with people who do care, even on difficult projects, then the sky's the limit."

So there was huge work and responsibility to fill up. As a BP of Microsoft I also learned the official and productive team work. The management was nice. Hardest part was to give the proper service to the consumer because there was always full of consumers. Interesting part was to introduce all Microsoft Device to the consumer."
good,"Great company to work for, but some orgs are just too political. It really depends on which team and org you are at - it's a huge organization."
good,Great coworkers and team to work for.  People are transparent with direction of the company and opportunities for growth.  Best part of working there was the team I was on and my coworkers

good,"Un día de trabajo típico empezaba a las 10 de la mañana realizando mínimo 7 visitas durante el día en base a un calendario mensual, a las 3 de la tarde salía a comer y regresaba a las 4 de la tarde a continuar con mis labores hasta finalizar a las 7 pm. Aprendí a relacionarme con gente desconocida para asi lograr el objetivo de mis visitas, a trabajar bajo presión, a realizar planes de acción y desarrollarlos, a negociar y a ser paciente y perseverante. La parte mas difícil del trabajo era ganarme a la gente y negociar con ellos para poder colocar las exhibiciones en mejores lugares y que me dieran la oportunidad para capacitarlos, lo que más me gustaba era conocer gente nueva y darme cuenta de que mi trabajo estaba funcionando al verse reflejado  en las ventas."
good,Loved and enjoyed working for this company and miss working for this company. Great values and great organization to work for.

I learned a lot about Corporate Accounting and developed a skill set in Accounts Receivables and Cash Management. I learned how to research and fix misapplied funds and use what I learned to educate the team. My co-workers were incredible, supportive and we would help each other out a lot.

good,"My typical day at work is a very busy day. for example, answering phone call, on site off site issues, escalating tickets,  prioritize level of tickets, etc. I have learned so much from  bosses and co-workers on subjects such as weakness and pride.

good,"Great people, innovative, awesome life balanced and great leadership! Working with Microsoft has been a huge learning experience and a cool look into technology that embraces our lives."
good,"Good company, great benefits.  Encourages collaboration with others."
good,"det var mycket som styrde en arbetsdag allt berodde på hur bra det hade för gått skiftet man avlöste.  lärt mig tänka mycket på säkerhet med tanke på att det man hanterade var tunga saker,,ledningen hade man inte mycket med att göra eftersom man kunde ruliansen i det stora hela det var ett sådant jobb så att man viste hela tiden vad som skulle göras man fick reda på vad som skulle in med hjälp av kollegerna inne i tunneln,,den svåraste delen av jobbet var faktiskt när man skildes från arbetskollegerna kändes konstigt många av oss hade ju faktiskt jobbat ihop i 10 år den bästa delen av jobbet var man tjänade bra jobbade långa dagar fri mycket"
good,"•	Relaxed creative environment "
good,"I've worked there on one fantastic team for over 3.5 years.  I have very few complains about working there, although I have had friends in the company who found themselves working in teams with toxic cultures.  "
good,"A typical day at work is to provide quality customer service/support.

good,"you will find different technologies in Microsoft and you won't find yourself bored"
good,"As contractor, it is simple to work there. You only requirement is finishing the assigned project. You do not need on call, you do not need answer frequently wrong calls from outside, like I meet in Wells Fargo."
good,"Eu trabalhava como auxiliar técnico III na área de suporte"
good,"At Microsoft I learned a lot of different things that will benefit me in my future. I would come in, clock in, and hit the sales floor. Weekdays were very light and weekends were busy. Hardest part of the job was selling services with computers. Most enjoyable was my team and the fun we had."
good,The environment is very relaxed and it is a adult friends atmosphere.
good,"Highly Professional"
good,"Throughout my 10.3 Years of IT Career, I worked as Vendor at Microsoft for 6.1 years via Wipro Limited and 4.2 Years as Full Time Employee at Microsoft.  I Love Microsoft and the People that I worked/working with."
good,"ottima palestra per crescere, un buon profilo dinamico e giovane. molto corporation"

good,"Its Microsoft as you would expect it. Fantastic benefits, amazing culture and awesome people. The company takes care of their employees, hands down the best job I have ever held."
good,Excellent company to work for. MS cares about it's employees and offers excellent compensation and benefits.
good,"It was work experience for two weeks. The place was good to work because I love kids. I learned how to manage kids in nursery, listening to them, understanding them and fulfilling their needs. The management was good to work with because they were understanding. They told to me what I should do in the Nursery and how. The co-workers were understanding and managing the Nursery well. The hardest part of the placement was to stop kids crying. The most enjoyable part was being the kids and working for them."
good,Best place I worked till date. Ii was a completely new role. I put in a lot of effort and thoroughly enjoyed it.
good,"Great co-workers, the work is good and so is work/life balance"
good,Microsoft is a great company to wok for. The company continue to Innovative and has Amazing team world-wide.
good,this is the kind of work environmen that allows you to work at you pace and have the freedom to go outside of your field of work to explore other things around.
good,"Great place to work"
good,I have a huge degree of freedom on my current role since my boss is based on another country. Besides that the line of work I follow its somehow different from my boss so he has a lot of confidence in my judgment. I get to talk to people around the work and travel some times for meetings on another countries and that's something I really enjoy. The work climate is really enjoyable as every one on the office is really positive and understands very well the difference between work and non-work life. Management is really accessible since its a relatively flat organization so no matter what your level within the organization is you get to work really close with different managers. I learned about how to manage a group and how to make an efficient control of time. Hardest part of the job is to have the right balance between local office work load/people relationship and the same ones for all the other countries I work for.
good,"Working with Tech giant a different experience"
good,"I did learn everything about Microsoft licensing. Very interesting "
good,I enjoy the freedom that the company offers as long as your work is done immaculately.
good,A typical day at work would begin with stand up calls with the on shore and off shore team discussing status and the developers giving out their plan of the day.  Microsoft is about all brilliant minds working together generating great ideas everyday.  The beautiful and lavish campus has all the games you can name it.  The gifts and gadgets you get every year is remarkable. The hardest part of the job is long hours you spend at work.  The co-workers are equally smart and hardworking so to some extent there is this rat race to get better and do more.  In nut shell Lots of opportunities and lots of learning and lots of gifts and lot and lots of work.
good,"a typical day at work"
good,I drove Cox communication Van to customers homes and troubleshoot and connected them to TV or Internet as needed.
good,The interaction with the customers and co-workers... I learned a lot with new products and discussing purchases with customers. Management was on level to assist staff with areas of achievements. The hardest part was being able to work late hours.
good,The people I worked for really made this job fun.  The work was ok but the real reason to work for Microsoft is the people

good,Passionnant de découvrir et travailler sur cet outil collaboratif
good,The very friendly team from all over the world and create such a family environment. I learnt a lot about management in IT technology and the co workers are absolute fun. It is working at odd hour with (-6GMT) perhaps not as suitable and tiring but it is a vibrant and enjoyable company.
good,"Lots of learning opportunities"
good,Always at the forefront of technology and innovation breakthroughs
good,"Very nice and diverse corporate culture, good bonuses, however the age gap between younger and older employees is big. Not many opportunities to bring new ideas:e.g develop current excel models or reports etc."
good,"I started to work at 9am on every work day with a brief conference with manager and colleague. The manager will usually assigned us the task to complete by our own. We discussed our task on the firm's internal online chat room. At noon, we have an hour of lunch time. If we complete task before 6pm (the regular end of work day), we report it to manager and get a new task, otherwise, we continue to work on it until finish. The whole company is full of positive and energetic co-workers that motivates me and make me work as hard as i can. The overall experience is awesome."

good,"Although Microsoft is a giant corporation and I worked with people across the country I still felt like my job was important and appreciated.  I loved the facility I worked at in Irving, TX.  Perhaps my biggest regret is not pursuing a further career with them."
good,This is a great place to work and the people make it worth it. It is hard to get a work life balance if you want to advance or get ahead.
good,"A typical day at work is handling multiple accounts every day dealing with different personalaties and their business needs.  I have learned to be very patient and listen before speaking always helps.  Often times my customer's just want to vent on an issue that wasn't handled right instead of fixing it right away.  My co-workers were all great when I needed help or coverage they were always ready to help out.  The hardest part of the job is having the word ""Technical"" as part of my title but yet I did not have deep technical expertise. but I was able to guide them to the right resource when needed.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to visit different work sites and not having to go to the office every day and sit in a cubicle."

good,Worked here since 2003 in LA and Redmond. Business Groups and Sales Groups are both great place to work.

good,Great learning curve and challenging atmosphere. Had to work with three members handling 250 students between us. the support staff was excellent.

good,• Managing MSG-Networking Operations by providing 24/7 support
good,"I have never worked anywhere where you had so many career opportunities, to learn new things, work at new customer sites, and grow. But it all came at a price which was compensation was less than desirable, the work life balance was almost non-existent, and performance reviews were extremely tough."
good,It is a nice place to work and learn. It also provides flexible work options for employees
good,"fun, energetic place to work, friendly enviroment, many opportunities for advancement."
good,Great experience at Microsoft; you get to work with really smart people on great products. Innovation and teamwork is valued.
good,"We would tweet for up to 10 hours a day, while handling multiple clients at once. Our ability to provide Xbox customer support was unsurpassed by any other brand on twitter. Coworkers were great, the Management was great, but being up at 4:30 everyday and tweeting wasn't a job i could do for a long time. I loved the environment and the people as well as the product we supported."
good,Great place to make a lot of connections and to better stream-line what it is that you are looking for in your career.
good,"The organization grew to be over 100,000 employees while I was there. When I started, there were fewer than 20,000 employees. As a result of this growth, it became far more bureaucratic."
good,Great work/life balance with integrating things like bike ride to work and drying closets.  Plenty of interesting/fun projects to work on and room to move from project to project.
good,good work environment day to day involved working on Support cases and collaboration with different team at times. All the peers are very helpful. there is no Flexibility with work timings.
good,"High energy, creative environment with professional teams and collaboration across diverse teams within the video game industry. Very dynamic and high-pressure for live video show production, but overall a fun and rewarding place to work."
good,This is a good company for permanent guys. I am working here as a consultant. I have learned here a lot of things. Here culture also good and management is also cool.
good,"At Microsoft it is seemless in delivery task with ease of productive resources to work with.A nice and fun place to work and upscale one skills. "
good,"No work life balance at all, team is amazing as well as Satya's vision. Compensation is good and great benefits. Its hard to advance in the support engineer role as you have at least 15-20 people working in the team with you depending on the product you support, the competition is real. It takes years before you get considered for Sr. escalation engineer."
good,"Senior leadership easily distracted by new shiny things. Tendency to abandon users. Uses small lay-offs weekly to manage headcount."
good,"Microsoft is different from any company, they care about their customers and employees. It's not hard work, pretty easy and relaxing, you get many opportunities to travel and learn more about the company."
good,"I have enjoyed working with Microsoft.  They create so many opportunities to make sure their employees aren't just sitting around staring at computers.  They genuinely give air that they care about their employees and their growth.  As a contractor, it was not something I could participate in but it was nice to see.  As long as nothing bad happened, the days are pretty easy.  However, your management can entirely make or break this job for you."
good,Amazing company to work w.r.t brand and benefits. A lot of opportunities to learn and grow. Everyone is competitive. Need to improve on collaboration aspect at the workplace.
good,"I have complex opinions about the company, in that I perceive some aspects of the company and the people to be world class / hyper-excellent; and I believe to other be quite low quality. I'm proud that the company has improved (or eliminated) most of those issues I perceived to be severe problems a few years back, which I think is unbelievably amazing. (I never thought it would happen.)"
good,"Nice company to work.I learn the technologies."
good,"Your career advancement, job security, compensation, etc are usually tied closely to what you put into your work. You can cruise at Microsoft because it is such a big company, but if you do you are more susceptible to layoffs, and not as likely to quickly secure a new role after layoffs. "
good,I have never worked in such a great company as is Microsoft. Everyday is fun creative innovating. If you don't know everything it's totally fine to ask questions. Everyone learns together at a different learning curve. Every single day you learn something new. Always being able to pivot and multitask as well as having great communication skills with my peers and customers was something that I really enjoyed doing.
good,"Flexible timings, work culture is good.Lot of opportunities. direct connects with clients.Weekly Fun activities so that employees are refreshed. Enjoy the work."
good,"At the heart of innovation with digital transformation and AI being a top priority. "
good,Working with MICROSOFT gives me a great pleasure and really the work enviornment is very  good  i really enjoyed the work and the management is also very supportive.
good,"Case back log may be high but as long as you're good at time management it won't be an issue."
good,"Microsoft is a great company for two types of people: full of energy starters who are hungry for knowledge and experience and 15-20 years MS veterans with tons of stocks and benefits who are the best in playing political games and taking advantage of their status. Not really good for strong professionals focused on business results vs politics as they are made to feel as they always need to compete for visibility and prove they are not worse than people who are focused on their achievements visibility. Also, you really need to be careful about who is your manager here, it will define your whole career."
good,"Able to work from home"
good,"Travailler au sein d'une entreprise telle que Microsoft a été pour moi une très forte expérience. D'une part, cela m'a énormément appris sur ce qu'est faire partie d'une vraie team et d'avoir des responsabilités au sein de celle-ci. D'autre part, j'ai pu constater également la disponibilité des différentes équipes lorsque cela était nécessaire pour la réalisation de mes tâches pendant un an. "
good,"great environment"
good,"if you are comfortable with the big-company culture and can break barriers across divisions, you will thrive in Microsoft.  Highly results-oriented compensation system."
good,"With Satya at the helm, Microsoft has turned over a new leaf and once again become a cutting edge, forward thinking and dynamic organization.  The ""Program Manager"" title at MSFT is roughly equivalent to ""Product Manager"" at other tech companies"
good,"Excelente cultura laboral, la cual promueve integración de los empleados sin distinciones ideológicas, de raza, genero o preferencias. Es una empresa que mejora constantemente sus procesos, herramientas y que cuenta con el personal mas capacitado. Reacciona rápidamente según la tendencia macro económica y competencia tecnológica."
good,The data center work is extremely customer-oriented. The work is constantly coming in and at times piles up quite ridiculously. The work is sometimes very repetitive but does occasionally become problem solving which requires some very laborious work. Overall the work space is a good environment and the teams are friendly. Certain management personnel are not the best but overall its a great place to work.
good,"Among the top companies to work for in the world. Great products and very talented people. Business focus on cloud has benefited greatly the financial performance. The company is a giant, having said that there are business units that are strategic for the company and other's that aren't, ideally you'd be part of a strategic BU otherwise the opportunity for growth is limited."
good,Working for the Microsoft Computer/VR Specialist was a great experience. My manager was always in contact with me incase of anything going on. I was in charge of my own sales/data entries/reports. You really felt like your own supervisor all while still having to keep in contact with higher management.
good,I really enjoyed my time working at Microsoft.  They provided a rich culture to work in.  I was able to take advantage of many learning opportunities though on campus courses and tuition reimbursement for college classes.
good,"Results depend upon which manager you end up with. Also, make sure to change positions after 4-5 years max. Another tip, make sure that you stay current in the latest coding style. C++ changed drastically from C++98 to C++17 and you can find yourself a dinosaur quickly if you didn't keep up to date."
good,"Microsoft has been a great place to work thus far. Over the years I've been there, they have taken chances on me and given me countless opportunities to help me grow and achieve more. I will always consider Microsoft to be one of the best places to work with an incredible balance of fun times and firm priorities. I have been mentored and trained since day one and still to this day feel like I learn something new every shift."
good,"Good experience, nice teamwork. They will support you endlessly, push each other for the better, one win is a win for all. Flexible hours, work at your convenience but get work done."
good,Internship was amazing. Gain real-world experience in a creative and refreshing way. Work seem more like fun! Learn many new skills and was able to provide important feedback to improve future internship programs.
good,"Good company  to work with,  good management, salary on time joining and exit formalities will be conduct smoothly , will join the company again in future"
good,Great finance leadership team that sets clear top down expectations for achieving business and organizational goals. Focused on digital transformation and forward-looking initiatives.
good,"Microsoft in general is a great company to work for as long as you get a good management team, get the wrong team and it can be miserable. Enjoyed the company, though I had ongoing issues with my direct manager."
good,"The clientele was memorable and we had some good experiences between coworkers for the most part. Overall, it was a decent experience. I put in my two weeks notice before departing when I mov"
good,"Employee benefits are AMAZING. Management was very disorganized, they made me feel like they were toying with me when it came to hiring. The general manager guaranteed me a permanent position but never got back to me. I called back, they said they're working on the paperwork. They had me wait around unemployed for a month and I just gave up."
good,Lots of learning opportunities for people who are so inclined.  Growth opportunities can be extremely competitive.   World-class resources for some teams.
good,Great place to work and gain invaluable experience. There is a place for everyone if you are willing to find it. Take advantage of the internal programs and services and the many opportunities to meet a wide variety of people.
good,"Loved the people and the environment was a pleasure to work at.  The work to life balance there changes with the wind, but if you know what to expect, there is no real surprises."
good,Company very much value diversity.  You could be your authentic self at work.  The training received was relevant and thought their management training superior to what I received at other companies
good,"Good place to work with good benefits cover. I have learned a lots when I worked 5 years there unfortunately the plan in Wilsonville was closed. Good team work, good people worked there."
good,"Relaxed environment, pay is good, management is lacking, break room was nice, people who work there are nice, good benefits, nice discounts, tuition reimbursement, stock help, health/dental benefits were really good"
good,"Life at Microsoft is incredibly fast paced and there is certainly an expectation to perform. As support, you are surrounded with a vast amount of other, talented individuals."
good,"Công ty là một môi trường làm việc tốt với lương và đãi ngộ ổn thoả, chi trả nhanh gọn"
good,"Microsoft Canada is a large company with lots of opportunities to grow careers."
good,"Many teams to choose from, variety of work going on. Infinite opportunities to rise to the occasion. Driven individuals will learn a lot. If you are clueless, you may end up not learning much."
good,"As a former employee of Microsoft, I can honestly say that this company truly cares about its employees. There are many different elements of the culture which embody their belief of how important their customers, and employees, are."
good,"Great company but like IBM no guarantee that you will have a job. The are constantly laying off people, in fact they just hired 350 people but only half will make it more than 6 months."
good,It was an amazing experience to work at Microsoft India. The company really cares about your learning outcomes particularly for the interns.  The return offer rate is good if the project goes well.
good,"Spend around 4days on customer visiting and traveling per week, around 60#, 3 hours internal and external phone calls. I learned time management and task priority. The most enjoyable"
good,It's tough to give a fair assessment to Microsoft as I am actually a contractor from a different company.  But there is a relaxed environment that doesn't seem as cutthroat as other companies people talk about.  A great place to perfect skills without being pressed too much.
good,"buena empresa, incentiva de manera constante al colaborador"
good,"Bom lugar para trabalhar, recomendo como experiëncia, e dependendo do que espera na carreira, permanecer."
good,"I like Microsoft culture of diversity. The working environment is pretty comfortable. It had good compensation and benefit before, but now are getting worse (e.g. Medical Insurance). It feels that the company is trending down instead of up."
good,"At Microsoft I used to work a lot. It requires a lot of effort and the threshold and goals are just impossible. It was a great experience, but I would not stay there for a life time."
good,"Over 17 years, I was able to grow in the industry, work towards both a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree while full-time employed, and had the freedom to balance work/life needs without concern for my position."
good,"There are many projects which you can work on, but unless upper management continues their support, even when there are org changes, then the likelihood is that the project is doomed. Overall, a good place to work, but watch out for org changes."
good,"DLI offers competitive pay and benefits, and works to place consultants in solid roles. This is not the typical ""place you and forget you"" consultant company.  They do regular follow ups with both you and your Microsoft manager, as well as providing any necessary equipment and training resources.  They have office space available for those who need it, and they actively engage consultants in in-person networking, mentoring, and learning opportunities. I would recommend this company if you are interested in doing consultant work at Microsoft."
good,I think Microsoft is a great place for learning and also to experience diversity. I think this is a great company to work for and would highly recommend it.
good,"Đòng nghiệp luôn giúp đỡ khi bạn gặp khó khăn."
good,"The Microsoft Hardware Team is innovative, visionary, and willing to back it up with serious money.  Networking is amazing, and people are enthusiastic.  The product design process, however, is slow; so if you want to churn out product after product quickly, this may not be the place to work."
good,"If you can't stand the politics, be a vendor at Microsoft. This lends for a much better culture overall and fewer meetings throughout the day. The cons are that there's no ability to grow or excel in the company, and you're subject to an 18-month rule where you'll have to take 6 months off to work there again."
good,"I love the culture of this company! the people is amazing. You work with people from lots of countries so you learn something new every day."
good,"Nice place to work, work and life balance was great, I learn a lot technically from working at Microsoft, I got a chance to meet some great people while working there."
good,"This is an excellent company. Their product and vision are second to none. Fiscally smart, co-workers very reliable. Great environment and the product is top-notch, it was an honor to work here."
good,"Great company, good benefits, good people. The culture is very good and it's great to work for a company that everyone knows. The work-life balance worked well for me."
good,"- Vaihtelevat päivät projektien mukaan"

There are many opportunities to take advantage of, being a DC tech is a good entry level position but you may find it harder to articulate your daily contribution like some other administrative roles. You may find that you hit a ceiling in terms of career development. However, Microsoft has many resources to help combat that although they are new to the Data Center world and are still figuring out the market and how to run handle there technicians."

My direct team (Cognitive services) were very busy, however I never felt I was intruding on their time and they always had the answers to my questions.

The benefits are the best I have ever seen - you get thousands in perks you won't get elsewhere."
good,"Overall the company culture and work environment are great. People that work at Microsoft are very sharp and tend to take their job very seriously. The downside is the occasional layoffs, contractors rolling off network, or FTE's moving around to different teams, can make the consistency of working with various teams a little challenging."

good,"It was a wonderful experience working at Microsoft campus with some brilliant designers and developers."
good,"No matter what retail store you apply to, it will always be retail; Microsoft legitimately pays you to learn, in retail. If you work in inventory, you will feel useless around 1.5 years of staying there. I understood every process allowable through Microsoft inventory guidelines in terms of retail stores, it’s nothing different than anything else you’d expect, except the remote server you connect to is insanely unresponsive. Management is nice always, store manager’s vision will always be withheld from lower-pay employees because a level of trust must be established before they let you in on anything. I loved the job, people were why I stayed. Insane growth opportunity if you act like it’s the only thing you ever want to do with your life."
good,"Microsoft is a great place to work where enough opportunity to learn new things and enhance your technical & soft skills. Opportunity to try your idea's and innovate new product or services. "

good,I choose not to provide a review of my experience at Microsoft. I have rated the company accordingly and choose not to provide additional information.
good,"Great place for a contract position, I imagine it is a great place for an FTE role as well. Would like to find an FTE role within Microsoft. I have had a great experience with my MSFT manager and the team is very smart and great at what they do."
good,"I have worked at Microsoft on and off for four years. I have had the pleasure to work on a variety of exciting new projects, under managers who truly care about their employees and products. It can be hard to transition from contractor to full time, but that would really by my only gripe about working for Microsoft. They strive to have a very open, inclusive environment.

good,"It is really fun to work in a friendly atmosphere where people around you will always motivate and help you to learn new technologies."
good,"Easy Work. You learn enough about product to get you by, but you should know computer basics already. Provides equipment. Top level management is great, in store management, well that depends on who your in store manager is. Hardest part of the job? It's customer service. Most enjoyable part of the job? When I make someone who really needed help with their computer smile. It's all worth it then."
good,"Microsoft is a good company to work for with full time benefits, paid time off and holidays, as well as a professional work environment with semi-casual clothing policy. The work has always been steady and no one has been let go due to downsizing, although there is no room to move up, you can only move sideways into different departments. Managers are hired from outside of the company."
good,"Microsoft was an amazing experience minus the one bad manger experience that I had. Great co-workers, benefits, and overall company culture."

We are there to set them up fr success whether or not they buy that day. We want customers for life, so if that means setting them up with a quote, just answering question, or selling them a product (or multiple) we are here to do that with an attitude you cannot find anywhere else. The hardest part and most enjoyable part of the job is wearing many hats! There is no such thing as ""that's not my job"". We are a team and support everyone no matter what position they are in."
good,"Microsoft India is a fun place to work.Not only does the campus boast of facilities such as lawn tennis courts, a football field and large cafe, it has some of the brightest minds to work with.

good,good place to work. there is always opportunities to advance and if you work hard you are very well compensated. they really know how to treat their employees well.
good,"This is a very, very corporate environment to work in. Managers tend to be uptight and don't spend time with lower level managers and have a chip on their shoulders. Outside of the group people are awesome"

good,"Growth and job security wise - very difficult and non-existent.  No rewards and performance is inconsistently measured.  Work and life balance is non-existent.  However, employees are intelligent and well-rounded; in comparison to Amazon, there is a lot of flexibility despite the long hours"

good,"Able to learn, adapt and grow in an environment with a positive mindset in order to redirect the potential of others in the work place to better the overall success of the company."
good,"Microsoft is a dream gig to land, so of course it's great to have on your resume. They promise you opportunity to advance, which is true, but they also promise you a balance of family and work life which is false. The HR department is a JOKE and favoritism is HIGH, at least when I was working there."
good,I learnt a lot during my employment. They took their time to invest in training and development support was always available. I would recommend this company for anyone who wants to work in IT.

I really miss BT's presence in the north America."
good,"Challenging and fun. I would recommend working here for experienced or people starting out. "
good,"By far one of the best companies I've experienced in my career however it is a very political environment. Actual performance may not be considered as the perceived contribution. Been seeing example of some very professional individuals doing badly and at the same time some avarage performers being promoted and going through the ranks. Company is great, work/life balance is good, slary is better than many places."
good,The competition contributed to lack of collaboration among team members. Most of the business teams are working in silos as independent business units.

good,Working at microsoft has been a great experience. You get exposed to many products and learnings that by the end of a couple months you will already have learned various skills that should help you become a great employee. Microsoft makes sure to help along the way. They provide many E-learnings to beef up your knowledge and also pay any certifications or school up to a certain limit each year to advance in your education.

good,"Good company to work in where there is work-life balance but a lot of insecurity. Overall, I would recommend Microsoft as a good employer with good pay benefits"

good,"Challenging with the amount of quota given increasing each year until it becomes impossible to attain.  No additional career path for Account Executives. If you are lucky enough to find another path out of sales, then your job level, salary, age and gender will come into play."
good,"Randstad Sourceright is a friendly environment place to work with free breakfasts & very understanding, supporting management. The downside is; fair chances to grow or fair wages wrt to workload. if you are not growth oriented & looking for a steady hourly job, it is a great place to be. Also allows Work from Home opportunity."
good,I choose not to review this job due to the fact that i signed a contract to not do any surveys or even talk about the details of my job.
good,I find Microsoft a great place to work. However in the last few years there have been considerable changes in the way people are accessed and I don't really like the way they review the annual performance. I had a great time working at Microsoft and still love the culture and technical readiness initiatives at Microsoft.

good,"Horários e tarefas relaxadas, funcionários ficam bem a vontade, ambiente agradável e a experiência de se trabalhar com desenvolvimento."
good,"Login to case volume, check to see how many cases need to be completed that week and follow up's for the day. I've learened that you can never limit yourself on how fast you can complete an assignment even with tribulations. Managment was not organazied but it did not stop me from completing my task. It was a very easy work place my co-workers were all there to do one thing and that was to get the job complete correctly. The hardest part of the job was having to work for ""yourself"" with no one watching what you did. It was all about self discipline, that aslo could fall in the category as the most enjoyable part of the job as well!"

The system employee evaluation encourages rivalry among fellow coworkers,on the outside everybody seems nice but when it comes evaluation time, they will destroy you if see you are a good potential for a raise. They stressed the importance of work life balance but that's another fantasy. You will not look good if you don't keep up with emails during your days off or even vacation.

good,"From my experience Microsoft Management states that they want all employees to have a good work/life balance but their actions to date do not support the statements.  Employees quite often get penalized for not working 60-80 hours a week as that is what Management deems as the norm.  While employees may be able to get their jobs done in 40, perception is that they aren't doing a good job unless they live at their desk 24/7.  Happy they decided to do away with ""Stack Ranking"" since I have seen many very good employees get canned because their peers know more managers than they do."

I've gained valuable troubleshooting skills with Microsoft Exchange and have improved my soft skills with handling customers' concerns over the phone. Management is very different than most companies I've worked for in the past; they do not micromanage at all, but rather make sure you're aware of the metrics that you should be reaching. My co-workers are comprised of some of the smartest people in the IT industry. It's a privilege and honor being able to work amongst such intellectually gifted individuals. The hardest part of the job is troubleshooting complex technical issues that involve parts of Microsoft Exchange that I'm unfamiliar with, or I'm still learning about. It's also difficult to handle politically hot customer issues while trying to resolve the issue in an expected timeframe. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the gratitude from customers when I resolve their issues. "

The culture is laid back, casual attire, but also very passionate about software and helping customers and companies to be successful. A very rewarding place to work and also highly competitive."

good,Microsoft is excellent employer and invest in training and development of its employees. It was excellent experience working with great innovative minds
good,"I enjoyed working at Microsoft. Although at times it did feel fairly regimented, I also felt that there were more than enough perks to make up for it. I enjoyed both the team I worked with and our managers. One of the hardest parts for our team was sometimes the interaction with the development team wasn't always easy."
good,Enjoyed working at Microsoft. Got to update my skills while working. Management was great. Did have a lot of work at times but there was also slow times during winter.
good,Having a blast working for Microsoft! The company is all about learning and development. I have had the opportunity to help many customers with their computing issues and they're always appreciative.

good,Very reactive environment working to satisfy our customers.  A target rich environment for improvement as we are changing the world while the world is spinning.
good,"I am grateful for my time at Microsoft. It was adventurous. I mostly worked with incredible people and haven't found that caliber of professional consistently since leaving. The higher you go, the less work balance you have, so when I wanted to be with my family, I decided that it was time to go. If you get an opportunity to work at Microsoft, even for a short time, take it."
good,"Just trying to move forward and not write a review.  I do things voluntarily, not when a system forces me to.  I can type for a long time to give you the characters"
good,Great place to work - culture has evolved over the last several years and the company is advancing its strategic goals.  Good opportunities to move internally and grow.
good,"Microsoft offers great benefits, flexible work schedule, lots of autonomy and a competitive compensation package. It remains a great company to work for"
good,"Great company to work for. Excellent place to start a career. To much bureaucracy in management.  Everybody wants to be a chief and nobody wants to be an indian. Great benefits packages, very diversity oriented environment."
good,"With opportunities to work at home and have an office that is open 24/7 is fantastic. I do the same work that I did at my previous job, but am compensated way better, treated more respectfully, and have management that actually knows what they are doing."
good,Great diverse bunch and love working with Europeans who envelope a good work/life balance. We were very efficient and deadline oriented. would have liked to worked onsite more if possible.
good,"-hard work and a lot of pressure "
good,the day was great. one of the best corporate culture
good,Oranization culture was awesome celebrating every culture fun with work and management was so good enjoying annual party and office picnic and also celebrate birthday baash .
good,"My experience at Microsoft was none less than amazing.  Great people, great tools, fantastic resources, instant credibility.  Allowed me to grow and achieve new skills and develop higher and higher goals."
good,Muy conforme. Ambiente laboral increíble. Posibilidad de crecimiento.
good,"Workplace was friendly. At all locations that I worked throughout NJ and FL, everyone was inviting. Competition to move up the ladder was difficult and at all locations management had favorites that would rank up the ladder within three months. After working at Microsoft for three years, I wanted to advance to corporate as an Evangelist, and had the opportunity to interview at the flagship store prior to opening. Nonetheless, benefits were fair."
good,I was a contractor at Microsoft and besides the heavy leaving you out to dry 6 months on cool-down. I think its a great company to work for with a thriving environment and great secure facilities and very professional employees.
good,Position I held at Microsoft was contracted through Volt Workforce Solutions and Compcon Tech. Working Contract you are not eligible for the same benefits as a Microsoft employee. Overall the pay was great and the environment was very relaxed. Received the right amount of training to effectively do my job and after contracts ends you have an opportunity to work in a different department allowing for more training. Great job overall.
good,Loved the education and vast opportunities.  So much to learn as you grow with the company.  Communication and group meetings are frequent.  All necessary tools are provided to do your job.
good,"I enjoyed working with so many intelligent people at Microsoft.  the work was challenging and I felt fulfilled.  the company does encourage you to work hard and for the right reasons.   Microsoft gave large bonuses based on performance so I was able to earn around 40 to 50% of my salary in bonuses for many of the years I worked there.  I was asked to work on a product that was quite complex and had many issues at the time for a period of about 3 years.  I was working close to 80 hrs per week which along with traveling became to much.  They will work you as hard as you let them.  But if you get in the right position working with the right technology, It is hard to beat Microsoft as an employer."
good,"I am done with contract work and I am looking only at FTE positions.  I enjoyed my time at Microsoft, it was fun and challenging.  My advice to anyone looking for a position at Microsoft is, only accept an FTE position. Some groups do not treat contract employees well."
good,"Microsoft is a great company for sales professionals and techies. Very progressive and transformative. The company is going through a growth period, so things are ambiguous, but I'm confident it will change within a year or two."
good,Ambiente di lavoro dinamico e stimolante. Richiede molto impegno e spesso per raggiungere gli obiettivi aziendali è necessario trovare un compromesso con la vita privata.
good,This work environment prepares you for everything. Its such a competitive environment that sometimes you forget that you are all working towards one goal. The people however are diverse and you meet some great people.
good,"Microsoft is a great place to work.  The newer tech companies get all the publicity, but Microsoft has been amazingly consistent in its performance and is really seeing a renewal.  I love the vigor that Satya exudes."
good,the workplace was awesome. Learnt a lot of stuff on completely core technical. My journey in Tech Mahindra was really great. Worked in Microsoft  Global Change Operation (GCO).
good,"Routine day is again based on the project you are assigned to"
good,"Microsoft is an amazing place to work but like any large company it has its challenges.  Job satisfaction is dependent on your manager and your job focus.  The jobs that are core to the organization, Windows, Office, Azure, etc. are more secure than jobs that can be seen as dispensable.  Also oftentimes employees that are aggressive to the point of doing whatever it takes to get ahead are rewarded with management positions which perpetuates unnatural behavior."
good,This opportunity I had to have work experience at Microsoft was amazing. I was not able to achieve a higher role o get pay but it was more for the experience.
good,This is an amazing company to work for. They really took care of my when I had my first child. I took the entire 3 month parental leave as a father. Really great company.
good,"Being a contractor, i had some limitations but overall good work place.I was allowed to work virtual when needed. The team was encouraging and opportunity to learn new technology."
good,"Good experience"
good,"A great company to work for. There is a purpose in this org and you feel powerful to be part of that force. "
good,"Was able to apply skills from past education. There was never a slow moment. The work kept you busy, and the people helpful. The environment was very pleasant to work in."
good,I highly recommend microsoft as a company. This team Microsoft Health is very disorganized and doesn't have a clear vision of its future. It made working on this team hard.
good,"Microsoft has be a great place to work and as a Software Developer in Test for the last 18 years I have learned a lot.  Good benefits package(Used to be Excellent benefits package), decent pay, and excellent co-workers."
good,I had worked in the International team for many years and had great opportunity to learn many different cultures and people from all over the world. It was always busy since I was not only working with people in the same time zone but also managing the team in overseas. Achieving the goals with various teams was always hardest part of the project but at the same time that was the most fun and rewarding part of the project.
good,Old way of working of save your skin and compete with each other is going away but very in a very slow pace. lots of flexibility and some work life balance but you will have lot of pressure and sense of not doing it right even when you are doing it right...changes are constant and that's can worn you out.
good,A special place to work when you find the right opportunity and team.  The business is a thought leader (which is not recognized externally) and always looking to advance.
good,"Sincerely speaking, i really enjoyed my job with Microsoft corporation.they made provisions for all the necessary apparatus i needed to discharge my duties creditably well without any stress.i think best company i have ever worked with."

good,"Good environment to work in,"
good,I work in a great office with terrific people.  I have learned a lot and wish I could stay on.  I have learned quite a bit and have worked with very impressive people.
good,"My job requires many different mini tasks. I first check my email and instant message my leads and managers to get an update on the quality control process. I work closely with my teammates to provide the best quality work we can. I learn new Microsoft applications everyday. This includes Microsoft office, Outlook, and Skype. Some of what we do is data entry and some of what we do requires detail of Bing Map's imagery."
good,"This place is simply perfect. It offers cool public areas with beanbags and cozy couches, xBox with 60"" screen and a ping pong table. It also has private areas and meeting rooms for teams to focus and hold discussions. As well as, personal areas where all engineers have their own offices which is transparent not to let people be isolated. Every engineer is loaded with the best equipment one can have, in  addition to access to very powerful machines for heavy processing."
good,Good environment to work in a lot of management standing around to help sales reps enhance sales and work on weak aspects.
good,"A typical work day involves calendar management and support for 2 busy General Managers along with their team. Respond to email, approve expenses, work on projects, make travel arrangements, book conference rooms and order food & beverages for scheduled meeting. Will sometimes provide support to other GM's and VP if administrative support is out of office."
good,"Its typically a busy but fulfilling day at arvato(microsoft). "
good,Good work/Life balance. Great physical buildings. Positive team environment.
good,"Não é atoa que a Microsoft figura entre as Melhores empresas para se trabalhar, ela realmente faz jus ao posto."
good,"Work days are very stressful if you work in the call center. Managers are good at stepping in if they need to. Co-worker are very close with each other. Hardest part of the job is the callers.  If you do not have tough skin, this will not be the place for you to work. Everyone on the MS campus appreciates all the hard work the call center operator do. Overall it is a nice place to work at."
good,"Being the largest and most diverse technology company on the planet, incredible work environment with a very diverse campus of talent."
good,"i learned how to photocopy, print, laminate, scan, bind, record daily sales, and even my typing skills improved."
good,"Microsoft is a cool place to work."
good,Its a great place to work.  Great employees and a fun atmosphere.
good,I have had nine great years with Microsoft and feel it is time for me to move on and invest what I have learned into other career opportunities.  The management team has been very good at helping me obtain my goals.  I have learned from many of my coworkers and have developed great relationships with them.  The hardest part of my job has been keeping up with the 30% year over year growth in a mature market and having a team quota vs an individual quota.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when I help my customers either save money or time in their datacenter.
good,"The company offers a lot of possibilities to growth (lots of technical resources, lots of professional growth opportunities around the worls, inumerous Microsoft events, etc)."
good,Microsoft is a great place to work with many very smart people.  I enjoyed my time there.  The review system is nasty and creates an environment that is often times negative.  Many strategic missteps have impacted the company in recent years and MS faces intense competition in the years ahead.
good,Worked with some of the greatest minds in the environment in a highly charged sales organization. Great friends are truly missed.
good,Grande indépendance laissée aux employés qui peuvent prendre de nombreuses inititatives
good,"Fun, friendly team environment, a lot of support for employee development whether that is by your peers or management. "
good,"During the early days we had fun, internal and external competition and healthy environment."
good,horrible manager but had fun. if you are not a people person then this job is not for you
good,"Excellent opportunity if you are in the right role."
good,"The sky is the limit if you want to succeed at Microsoft!  It can be competitive but only if you desire that.  In general, an environment that is great for moving up in your career."
good,"Microsoft is always looking for top performers in their service organization.  It is a bit of an up or out culture. Lots of training opportunities, and you will never be bored."
good,I did not work with the company for that long to determine how working there is. I've only been with this company for a month but it seemed fun due to their events on a specific day.
good,"The management cares, but needs to allow for improvement. No warning system for poor performance, only termination. They do use a managed service for the part I was assigned to, so that may be the issue."
good,The work environment and work culture is very good and productive. The network is huge and you get a great hands on experience while working in this environment.
good,"Teams where fun to work with,  I loved the free drinks and the cafeteria was restaurant quality. Corporate policy for vendor was a bit shallow but the Full time employees where extremely nice."
good,"Agradable, muy buena empresa (agencia) para laborar."
good,"* Learnt a lot while working here."
good,"Microsoft Team zeichnet sich aus durch hoher Kompetenz und hoher Einsatzbereitschaft. Die Leistungsdruck ist hoch, aber damit ist auch der Chance auf Erfolg sehr gut."
good,"Loved working there for 5 years - but my contract was not revnewed at the end of year 5 - so with tears in my eyes I left Microsoft.  Many full time employees have also been let go....So sad."
good,"You work from home, with meeting scheduled 7am to 7pm, sometimes after hours for international customers, always on the road for travel within the region."
good,Every day we worked to improve our customers experience in using our tools. There was a great workplace culture that extended to supporting you both within the workplace and your non work place live.
good,"As a PA, the pace at Microsoft is breakneck from the moment you start until the moment you leave, you need to hit the ground running and will need to be comfortable with feeling uncomfortable as the workload is immense.  However, the culture and people are second to none, and it is a thoroughly fabulous place to work as no two days are ever the same.  If you are a top level PA and okay with an 18 month contract (with no possibility of it rolling over) then I highly recommend Microsoft."
good,"Completely get the flexible nature of IT especially UX design. The use of Microsoft Technologies including teams makes virtual meeting and collaboration so much easier. The hardest part for me was very tight deadlines. The best part of the work, the team I worked with, wonderful people."
good,Will work there again. Excellent development tools to get your job done. Excellent benefits. Too much competition between employees. But some groups may fine.
good,"Good job, work life balance,."
good,Great place to work very friendly very organized i enjoyed working there everyone was really friendly the pay was not great management was okay could be better
good,Worked as a consultant in a mobile transformation project. The project was well organized and worked very effectively. Location was perfect and the offilce was nice.
good,I worked for Microsoft for almost 16 years.  There are many opportunities for technical and personal growth at the company.  I think it is a great company to start out working for.
good,"For a company of this scale, Microsoft has pivotted well from legacy (Windows + Office) to Cloud Selling (D365, M365 and Azure). "
good,"Microsoft was a great opportunity to work for, but it is young in the facility construction area. With so many initiatives at once, they can burn out employees."
good,Very fun environment. You will have the option to learn everything about the products and services here. Management can determine your outlook on advancement with this company.
good,Microsoft has always been on the cutting edge of technology. It is a collaborative yet demanding atmosphere offering opportunity to expand your career as well as enjoy the think-tank environment.
good,"Started my career as an internee which was full of a lot of initial learning about MS products like UWP, Dyanmix AX, Azure, MS Office 360, Sharepoint and IoT. It was a good learning curve and and future scope for whats coming ahead."
good,Be proactive and lean on the experienced team on things that you are unsure about for support. Do not sit on anything that is priority or it will get away from you.
good,"Amazing Office, Loving Teams, Eventful Days. "
good,"Amazing company to work on a global scale on technology that will touch almost everyone in the world. As a marketer, Microsoft provides opportunities to work on large, very well planned programs. "
good,"One of the very best employment experiences I ever had.  Microsoft gave me almost every opportunity to excel and I wasn't bashful about taking them on.  If you think you can thrive in one of the most intelligent, busy, and fast-paced companies on Earth, this may be the place for you."
good,"Great store. Closed now, but I hope that a new store will open! Creates a barber shop like feel to the place. Employees are all very friendly. Great coffee shop at this location."
good,"A super company who require 100% commitment and are in an ever changing environment, Constantly upskilling employees and enabling great career progression."
good,My experience thus far working as a contractor for Microsoft has been a pretty positive one.  The company is technically Experis / Manpower but it is a partner of Microsoft.  The job is full time as an Office 365 Support engineer.
good,"Microsoft was a pleasant company to work at with very friendly employees. Although, this was a short term position for me it was still a place where I felt included and welcomed."
good,I spent 16+ years with the company and was able to hold a variety of roles at corporate and in the field. Loved the passion and energy of the people and the roles were challenging too.
good,"As a vendor, I enjoyed the team I worked on. My managers were intent on knowing if I enjoyed my work, if I felt it was challenging enough or not. I can't speak to compensation or benefits."
good,It was a great company to work with and I got along with everyone. They did their best to help everyone grow. The growth mindset is what I took from my experience working for Microsoft for 5+ years.
good,"I loved Microsoft, but I was only there as a contractor in an entry level role, so I was making nearly minimum wage with no benefits. I have some friends who work there as FTE's and they have great earnings and benefits and great job security. "
good,Fast paced job but environment was still conducive to a productive work day. The management was supportive and helpful with completing tasks. Hardest part is always dealing with clients but was handled in a timely and appropriate manner.
good,"great place to work still a bunch of bad managers. the old culture of Windows was toxic. hope things are much better today."
good,Received a great opportunity to work for Microsoft as a contractor. I loved my teams and the culture. It was very flexible and understanding which was very nice for my family.
good,This was a temp job at Microsoft and was a great experience.  I had a wonderful supervisor at the time we were never left hanging on anything.  There was always a team to help you if you had any questions with lots of encouragement and relaxed yet productive work environment.
good,"Top heavy in certain organizations. The ""stack ranking"" system which incentivized members of the same team to compete with each other was discontinued but the remnants of that still exist within the culture. Very challenging to get associates to ""think outside the box"" because incentives tend to be purely tactical and any type of strategic thought and or initiatives are not recognized and supported by the local teams. It is safer to ""go along to get along"". In addition in order to ""survive"" it is advantageous to move around to different jobs within the company. This seems to be encouraged."
good,"Working for the Microsoft Accelerator Group, exposed me to the Microsoft way and I must admit that it was the way to go. Although my location was independent of the main office the culture extended far beyond the Seattle headquarter walls. The level of autonomy I was allotted allowed me properly balance my home and work life. My quality of life greatly improved as I managed to successfully provide administrative support to 5 busy executives in SF, Canada, Israel, Japan, and Saudi Arabia."
good,"Microsoft is a great company with very smart people."
good,"I do not wish to fill this in. I would like to move on and the system will not allow this without having something written in this space. So, here it is."
good,"You will be working with a lot of very smart and talented developers, but remember they are VERY detail oriented - small mistakes count for a lot!  Be detail oriented."
good,Projects fast paced and productive with ample guidance from management level. Team members communicate well and work effectively together using all tools available.
good,People at Microsoft is more energetic and the environment is super awesome. Management is ready to help. I was able to learn latest technologies as it arrives in the market and also how to deal with big companies to accomplish our goals.
good,"My job was only scheduled to be 10 hours per week.  However, they still expected me to work 40 hrs per week.  That wasn't possible as a single parent."
good,I enjoyed my time at Microsoft.  I would recommend working there if you can get in.  Great people to work with very different in approach and thought.  This is a place you have to experience.
good,"Benefits package is excellent, the main campus is beautiful and has some really nice perks. Cafeterias are good, walking trails, even some shopping if you go to the Commons. "
good,"I worked with MS for almost 8 years.  I really enjoyed it and advanced my skills greatly.  "
good,"Microsoft is a great place to work.  the culture is very collaborative and fast paced.  No day is typical, which makes it exciting.  Executive management is great.  The people and customers are the best part of the job.  Long hours are the hardest part of the job"
good,"It's an intense place to work, however, there are great things going on related to the transformation of the culture and dramatic changes to the business. It's a great place to work and a terrific learning environment."
good,"I actually work for Xerox Corporation who is contracted by Microsoft, however I am and have been received as a full time employee. 7day/24 hour access to facility."
good,"career advancement atleast on the sales side is not much."
good,Best place to work specially for Engineers and full time employees to enjoy the benefits. The work culture and atmosphere is so positive and motivating specially for the beginners.
good,"Great company, cool benefits, but a lot of burocracy moments."
good,"Microsoft has an incredible mission, which makes it easy to go to work everyday. "
good,"Microsoft has some of the best benefits in the industry.  The people are all super smart.  However, the culture of ""stack ranking"" still exists and your manager can either make or break you.  "
good,I have grown personally and professionally thanks to the company culture. I have been given great opportunities to learn and help others learn. I would recommend it as a great place to work.
good,"Good Place to work."
good,"Overall, this is a great company to work for and to be a part.  The leadership under Satya is changing and moving in a direction that has huge potential for future growth.  The benefits and compensation are above average and you have the opportunity to work with some of the greatest minds in the field."
good,"A great place to work as long as you embrace the culture and take responsibility for your career.  The skills I learned there are invaluable, and easily translate to other jobs or even family."
good,Microsoft is a big company and its easy to get lost in the shuffle. Reorgs are normal and different managers will come and go on a regular basis you can go from a sweet deal to a nightmare in a very short time but stick it out and you find your way back to the sweet deal again.
good,No doubt an organization of the forefront and you made your own career. You were able to have an immediate impact on the organization in which you worked! Awesome People
good,Lots of additional work outside a typical project work. At the end you are judged on those additional work and not on the successful delivery to your customers.
good,"Great company to work, great work life balance and culture that helps you learn and grow can take to desired heights. When you are surrounded with diligent, focused, performers you tend to grow into one."
good,"The culture at Microsoft is intense, fun, and somewhat collaborative.  The buildings and cafeterias are great and the option to work from home occasionally is a definite plus."
good,"Witnessed ardor to work and target driven approach, helped me fetch a Compliance Specialist role (NFTE) at Microsoft Corporation Pvt. Ltd. (Mar’16- Jun’16), where I had the opportunity to assist the West Region Lead & Sr. SAM Engagement Manager. This has been a unique experience to grow personally and enhance my leadership, interpersonal and communication skills."
good,"I as able to assist customers that were in the process of purchasing, various Microsoft products for personal or business use. I had a fabulous supervisor and worked with great people. When management changed , so did the compensation and the job. no longer wanted to work there"
good,"Much has been said about the shift in corporate culture. That's very much true in WA, but hasn't quite made it to the ""field.""  Your advancement in any of the sales areas outside of WA are still very much tied to who you work for. Your manager is your advocate and can either be a champion of your accomplishments or hold you back."
good,"fun places to work, with a large range of dynamic people. fun working culture through out. based on part time working- these were the best places i have ever worked."
good,Microsoft is a great company to work for.  You get to work with the most up-to-date software so you are always using the best stuff.  Everyone is very friendly and has the same goal which is to do great work and have fun doing it.
good,"i would love to work here and ive dreamed about this since i was a kid. please hire me. i will work till the day i die. i love tis job. its fun, it pays well and i could have never had asked for a better job."
good,"Microsoft is a wonderful company to work for. It was a highly enjoyable and educational experience. You truly have a sense that the company cares about it's employees, and the culture is one of high expectations, ""WOW"" experiences, and the sense that the company is making powerful and valued changes throughout the world. While I worked on the retail side of things, I felt engaged and an important part of the company. I loved interacting and helping customers find the best fit for them and their computer/gaming/technology needs. It's great to be able to educate others on a product I believed in."
good,"my experience while working at MSFT on misc assignments was a great experience. Most the Management (Kevin Natale, and Lesa Boulton to mention a couple) cared for their employess, they wanted and did everything they could to help one succeed and would go out of the way to help. unfortunately politics and upper Mgt (unknown) did no do the same for many people.However, this is everywhere.  But, overall the experience was great and very entertaining."
good,Buena empresa era genial el ambiente laboral. Me gudtaria regresar
good,Microsoft has made a lot of changes recently to help work work/life balance and taking care of its employees. It's a great place to work with lots of opportunities for advancement or career change.
good,A typical day at work is surrounded by operational tasks and customer interactions. You have the ability to lead your team through coaching and development and provide recognition in unique ways. The team has a lot of fun together and really is able to serve customers with a great experience.
good,"during the early hours you find me speaking to the clients,finding out pro-actively what their priorities for the week and organizing the team schedules around clients priorities.i do that on monday so that the whole week will be organised.i learn how to work with people"
good,"Enjoy the learning everyday, enjoy the smart people, drive for excellence and results. Love the company values and self-improvement and error-correction effort. Really rewarding to watch the organizational growth and talent development along with the business challenges and transformation."
good,Great Overall experience with them. Would love to go back someday! Worked on the West Coast Windows device teams. New management came in and laid everyone off with no warning which was very hard to deal with.
good,Very professional people to work with. Everyone is busy doing their own thing without any need for supervision. Everyone is a team player. A very friendly environment. Employees are easy and comfortable to assist each other. Employees are interacting very well with people at different socio economic levels
good,I found working at Microsoft amazing! People are upbeat and full of energy. If you are innovative this is the place to be! Microsoft has a great team of leaders and look to reach out to anyone who is willing to reach out to them.
good,"As Exec Bus Admin to the Snr Sales Lead for a EMEA Lead, my role was to ensure his diary and time management were fully optimized, that his travel was exact and made the full use of his available time and that he was allowed in his day to day operation to concentrate on what he needed to get achieved. I was the gate keeper to ensure only essential issues were brought to his attention. I was responsible for organising overseas meetings with internal and external stakeholders as well as an annual 5-day off-site in Europe for c. 150 people. I used MS Outlook and Skype for Business, as well as OneNote and Excel. I used on line internal databases and sharepoint sites plus electronic purchase order and invoicing tools. I worked with people from across Europe and in the US, and from all levels in the organisation. I worked efficiently and effectively both face to face in the office, and when working from home. The hardest part of the job was the travel however it was wonderful to visit so many beautiful European cities. The most enjoyable part of my job was organising the events and meetings and receiving positive feedback on my work."
good,"Best advice, be an FTE! i'm only wrirting this because it is making me. Microsoft is a great place to work as a Recruiter. The unfortunate problem is the limited number of FTE positions! Also, this isn't a place for ""real"" recruiters, you are a project manager at best... forget calling candidates and interviewing."
good,"Microsoft is great if you make it on as an FTE (Full Time Employee), which is a shame that more contractors (which do most of the work around there) are not hired into full time positions."
good,Working at MS is a fast paced high visibility activity. Teams work very close together to achieve a smooth and supportive flow.
good,"Management is open to feedback and always striving to improve. Plenty of opportunities to find your niche either in sales, coaching, tech services, community, or business."
good,"ASSURE Automation,  My function was to execute any necessary change requests and provide assistance to developers as they deployed updates to the service.   I was also assist developers with access to certain logs they might need to diagnose issues that we were seeing."
good,"Great experience working in High Tech. Constantly improving how work gets done, finding ways to be more efficient. "
good,"Aprendizado com os demais técnicos superiores e troca de informações e conhecimentos essenciais para o meu desenvolvimento de visão sobre manutenção industrial e processo de produção de eletrônicos."
good,"Самая трудная часть работы, это следовать строгому поминутному графику. Большая нагрузка, нужна хорошая выдержка и стрессоустойчивость, т.к. люди всегда звонят с какой-то проблемой и претензией. Ее нужно оперативно решить."

good,"Great people, great work place, challenging ideas, creative solutions for business problems, good work-life balance, many opportunities to learn and network."
good,"Once you realize how to navigate the matrix and cross team collaboration, you can do wonderful things. Be prepared to work hard. The good - Microsoft remains a high energy place to work, you can still be an entrepreneur. The bad - Microsoft remains a high energy place to work, putting in the time is rewarding but leads to some personal sacrifice."

good,Great leadership and opportunities. Overall no issues.
good,I will be greatful just by working at Microsoft I always wanted to work there  I know some people who works with the company I wanted to try it out one day. This will be a good working experience for me

good,I worked in HR and that is a very good group to be associated with. Everyone in the org is nice and in a good mood and that translate into great working environment. People are willing to help and provide good sound advice. Autonomy is number one everyone there works on their own projects like all adults should but are willing to step out of their areas to help. I loved working in the Hr group organization.
good,"Belle entreprise exigeante qui recrute du personnel brillant et humain."
good,Microsoft allowed me great flexibility to move between disciplines. I learned so many broad skills that it has stood to me throughout my career.Lots of mentoring opportunities too.
good,"My time with Microsoft is an amazing experience. We had the best team that one could imagine.  Microsoft was a great company to work for and I could not recommend it enough.  A typical day would be opening the store making sure cash and counts were both on point, and that the store was set up 100% correctly.  The rest of the day was getting your daily tasks completed while also giving world class customer service to the customers that would come up.  There are entirely to many things I learned with Microsoft to be able to put them all up here, but i learned how to be a better manager and person.  The workplace culture was nothing like id ever seen before Microsoft is an incredibly accepting company, and go out of there way to help as many ways as possible.  Best part was the people I have the privilege of working with, and what we all learned from one another."

good,I enjoyed my time at this company. The pay and benefits are great. The downside is management. There are a lot of incentives and they do teach you a lot.
good,"Lots of daily meetings, and was surrounded by some of the smartest people I've ever worked with. I also think that there were too many managers and that the work culture was initially poor. However the new CEO has worked very hard to change the culture."

good,Learned a lot of things using advanced machinery. I used automated measurement systems and programmable adhesive dispensing hardware to build very accurate test articles.
good,"I was fortunate to have seen both the field sales and corporate office angle of Microsoft.  Both are extremely competitive as new people are constantly being brought in.  This isn't a problem if you feed off the competition and just do your job the right way.  There is definitely a dichotomy between corporate and field resources...and it's a wide chasm unfortunately.  Microsoft could do a lot better if it took advantage of resources from the field feeding back up into the corporate headquarters.  Unfortunately, there seems to be a bit of a group think going on at corporate that doesn't take into consideration the field activities as much as you'd hope for."
good,"Ik had een speciale stage gecombineerd met een afstudeerscriptie. Niet de normale gang van zaken binnen Microsoft maar via een Manager op Global niveau kon ik binnenkomen bij Microsoft en mijn afstudeeropdracht uitvoeren. "

good,"Working for Microsoft is great.  Good work/life balance.  Compensation is not stellar, but benefits and work/life balance makes up for it.  In general, everyone wants to do the right thing and everyone is fighting the same fight."
good,"Many of the employees are engineers and they don't understand the Media business.  They are extremely good at what they do - providing enterprise software and systems, but they don't understand how clients actually use what the organization offers."
good,"An oppurtunity utilised at the maximum extent to learn from the peers, I am more than happy with the work which i have learnt. I have utilized it many times elsewhere."
good,Great place to work with good benefits. Company invests in their people and spends money on the right projects.  Work life management depends upon your team and the department.

good,"This company thrives on change, so you are always learning new skills. Highly ambiguous workplace with diversified workforce. Employs a growth mindset."

good,This company offers a warm work culture and has a very smart work force. I would recommend this company based on the fact that they offer a lot of continuous training.
good,I did extensive calendar work for the Sr. Director and  3 additional direct reports; procurement of office supplies and equipment; travel logistics; tracking budget to a limited extent; assisting with relationships with college students that visit at Microsoft and do school projects. 
good,"Overall good place to work. "
good,Microsoft can be great. It can be awful. If you are passive it will chew you up. 
good,An typical day at work would start at 7 am with prepping lunch and next day breakfast. 
good,"I'm still not convinced that the 18/6 months on/off contracts are the way to go.  Much prefer the managed projects contracts, for obvious reasons.  And I get more work done working remotely, as I have proven in my past two contracts at MSFT.  It's not for everyone, but it seems to work well for me."
good,I met with professors and students in the STEM departments and talked to them about campaigns Microsoft was running. I planned certain events throughout the entire campus giving away various items for chatting with me.
good,"Working at Microsoft means you are working with the best. Everyday you go into work ready to improve the lives of millions of people, so the pressure can be intense. You will sit in meetings or one-on-ones with people with some of the highest aptitude in their field. This is intimidating at first, especially when they turn up the intensity; however if you are confident in your skills and knowledge and willing to work together with them, they will recognize you equal and help you succeed."
good,"A typical day at work was a constant re-prioritisation, with many meetings, mandatory training, and a culture of ongoing learning.   Time management was crucial but it was a great pleasure to work in a culture where you were measured objectively, and could work from home or the office.   "
good,"Perhaps my most enjoyable, productive, and transformational contract engagement ever. Working in a managed service helped avoid the dreaded 180-day furlough. It's the only way to go if you want to work as a contractor at Microsoft. The service delivery manager is an excellent supervisor and team leader."
good,"Managed fast-paced project across multiple departments.  Drove team to accomplish all required tasks leading to a successful program and satisfied customer.  Excellent communicator, coach, and team player makes navigating a complex work environment look easy."
good,"At Microsoft, the most important thing is the group you are working for.  A typical day is largely driven by your daily responsibilities and is often driven by your meeting calendar as Microsoft is a heavy meeting and email culture."
good,Highly competitive type A driven company culture.  Especially as one ascends through the ranks.  Must be very self directed and able to bring your A game to the table at all times
good,"Great course structure and a great leaning opportunity. The only down side is if you don't have prior certifications or a good understanding in the IT world, getting hired by Microsoft may not go your way."
good,"Microsoft hires most of the support staff as contractors.  It is not only unfortunate for the support staff, it is unfortunate for the dedicated contractors who have to leave after a specified amount of time with no opportunity for permanency.  "

good,"installing new OS on laptops"
good,"Best work culture you can get in the industry, great co workers and projects are challenging in a good way. Job security could be an issue as overall budget for projects change every financial period."
good,"Not much more to add to the summary.  When it works for you, it's awesome, when it doesn't it's not all that fun.  They don't lock you into a position, so you can always move to something else."
good,"Microsoft is one of the few companies in the world where you can work with some of the smartest, most diverse people on the planet in an environment that is impactful to everyone in the world.  Your influence on the world around you is only limited to your own imagination, ability to defend your reasoning, perseverance, and influence.  It is a super tough place to work due to the competitive nature and talent of its employee base, but so rewarding for those with the drive to push through and influence the peers and leadership around you."

good,Fun place to work where you can bring products to market that people use in their day-to-day lives. Great discounts of Microsoft software. Management encourages you to use their tools daily and advocate for them to your social peers.
good,Immediate and skip level managers were not always great. UX is still not a 100% equal discipline with other disciplines. People are generally happy there.
good,A typical at Microsoft is filled with excitement ! Starting with the morning meeting to the end of the night meeting.  The cultural is a family . WE believe in each other and we support each other.  The management at Microsoft are wonderful. Everyone is very understanding and there is an open door policy. The most enjoyable part of my day is helping customers.

good,"I've been drawn to Microsoft because it's a company that changes the world. It's not the fastest or most agile, but it has good people, good conditions and usually fun. The main challenge at Microsoft is career management. The company doesn't ""take care of you"" in that sense, so you have to be dilligent in pursuing opportunities."
good,"great exposure, regional and WW experience and innovation, empowerment and great environment. Always on top of the technology and great place to be part of"
good,great team tough and time sensitive work but all in all a great experience and one i hope to find in my next job. additionally you had opportunity to advance as well it was a growing team so there were always new professional avenues to take it was a great internship.

good,"Been here for 7 years and i should say there are no regrets at all. What you learn is what you implement. It always depends on which team you join in, few teams give you lot of exposure to develop your personal intellect skills apart from what you learn professionally."
good,"Very political work environment. Good pay and benefits. Typical Day 8-9 hours. Based on what I did, the work was based on how many inquiries came in. Would have preferred more of a data-centric position."

I got to see some of the latest and greatest computer technology, and learn from experts who have worked in the fields of business and computer technology for decades. However, while the schedule was flexible, I always felt like there were unspoken expectations to work far longer hours than previous jobs I've had."
good,"Good management"
good,I have been here long enough to recommend it for anyone who is interested in doing stuff that will change the world. This is a place where you drive your own career.
good,"Working for Microsoft was an absolute blast. For the most part, they treat you like a person and not just a number. Working at the retail store and dealing with customers was not as bad as working with customers at other retail stores because they treat you with respect. I never saw any of my coworkers get yelled at or being mistreated even though some people are hard to deal with."

good,"I love coming into work because everyone is so much fun to work with in all departments. Whether its in inventory, leadership, techs, I absolutely love working in a high energy groups. Making friends and meeting new people is what I am currently experiencing now here at Microsoft. Microsoft provides me many opportunities to gain experience in to better my career future."
good,extensive eye for detail.  was difficult to have to mark people down for errors but was part of the position.  Had to be able to review and audit fairly and without bios.

Most enjoyable part of the job was the ever changing environment-never bored. Required overtime and initiative to get job done."
good,"As the founder and main talent buyer, I thoroughly enjoyed the time I had with my business. I had a handful of friends and employees that dedicated their time and energy to create a terrific atmosphere for local and national musicians. Managing everything at such a young age with only one other business partner taught me some of the most important career traits possible; dedication, perseverance, team work, management, etc."
good,"To be part of the BICI - CIMS Email Marketing Team has been a fantastic experience. In the past year I've learned a lot about data quality, targeting, content review and marketing privacy requirements. My teammates are fun, enthusiastic and knowledgeable.

good,"productive,"
good,"If you find a team that's a good fit for your skills, there is no limit to how much influence you can have, and the environment offers plenty of opportunities to advance from junior to senior to principal level. Microsoft is a great place for either individual contributor or lead roles and you're able to readily switch between the two with no impact on the level that determines compensation ranges.  Microsoft does re-org quite a bit, so a tolerance for such disruptions is helpful, and you may find yourself looking for a new place to land occasionally, but you're given a generous amount of time to find a group that's a great fit, so long as you put in the effort.  I highly recommend Microsoft. It was the simultaneously the most challenging and rewarding job I've had in a long time, working with super sharp colleagues who you genuinely want to go out for a beer with."
good,"Objetivos bem definidos"
good,"Ótima empresa, Melhores experiências pessoal e profissional."
good,"Good place to work, good pay, they will apply green card for the employee, causal dress code, promotions are hard to come by, on-call rotations are a bit stressful"

good,Did 20 years in the Marine Corps  we work using Microsoft programs. Throughout my time I became familiar with this program. Actually working directly for Microsoft no
good,"Microsoft is a matrix org.  Every employee must be able and willing to adapt to changing needs that revolve around the customer, Diversity and Inclusion, and compliance. Feedback is crucial to learning in respect to both giving and receiving feedback."
good,A company where you can expand your knowledge and get a chance to work on latest upcoming technology. Colleague will always ready to help if you get stuck. Nice management.
good,Really a warm atmosphere. I fit right in. Microsoft wants each and every one of it's employees to excel. They offer many opportunities to improve yourself. There are lots of perks to working here.

good,"Horaires flexibles, mission responsabilisante et enrichissante, très bonne ambiance et salaire intéressent."

good,"They are the best group of people to work with. Just laughs and sharing stuff. A typical day includes playing Minecraft in the break room, filling orders, and contact with management. I learned alot in cybersecurity and they fully support your interests. Management was always respectful and was interested in making the workplace more human. The hardest part of my job was dealing with angry or upset customers, but I just stayed calm and let them vent. The most enjoyable part of working here is how relaxed everyone is. They aren't wearing ties and suits."
good,Microsoft is definitely on the right track. Culture is improving especially in product/engineering. Services has a long way to go. Historically management has been pretty terrible and the culture hasn't changed i.e. they haven't replaced middle management like they replaced individual contributors when I first joined.
good,It is great to work for Microsoft. It is a lot of fun. Just make sure to have a strong work ethic and be driven to create amazing results. I love Microsoft.
good,"I was a remote contractor for Microsoft, but what I learned from the team helped drive me to new heights. From Microsoft, I got a lot of insight into what it meant to create content that not only helped the user engage with the material, but also master it."
good,Provides good support for those wanting to grow there career.  Lots of opportunity learn new technology and develop skills.  Good benefits.  Nice campus although offices are moving to open space that are noisy and distracting.
good,"Microsoft is filled with hard working and inspired people, which makes it a rich working experience. It's a high paste and high demand working environment, tough in the long run, but totally worth all the effort."
good,"Bonne entreprise , bonne formation ,  suivi en poste , bon salaire"
good,You can plan your day and within 10 minutes that plan is changes.  You must be flexible and adaptable regardless of the position you hold at Microsoft.  Any position is challenging and exciting.  The people working at Microsoft are fabulous!
good,They treat employees very well and work-life balance is very good but management is many many layers deep and it's difficult to have impact on company direction. Also promotions are very slow.
good,"Excellent place to work, great benefits, numerous career enhancement opportunities. Many different businesses in one company allowing for lots of innovation and impactful work at a high level."
good,"Great place to work, exciting technology and moving in the right direction. Tools and products are top notch and getting better with every release. Senior management is setting a the right direction."
good,My experience at Microsoft was good. I would recommend working there. Lots of opportunity but also lots of stress. Tools and process are a complete nightmare.
good,"Fantastic culture and team building environment"
good,"In general I like it; you must be prepared to spend a fair amount of time studying, as customers have high expectations of you as a Microsoft employee."
good,"Feb2018 to Present   Microsoft Corp"
good,"It is a busy environment.  Motivated, self-starters do well.  Must be able to work with ambiguity and be self-directed.  There are always changes and reorganizations as the company transitions to Cloud."
good,"Great company to work, lots of benefits but it's a fast paced constant change, which can be both a good and bad thing. The culture is great as everyone is in the same page under senior leadership to be a more collaborative work environment."
good,"I worked their on contract as a build engineer twice. My work schedule was 100% flexible. As long as I was available to do what my team members needed. Manager would always sign off on 40 hours/week time card even if you were only in the office for 2 hours/day because they knew your value. Eventually I worked 100% remote (which I heard was rare for contractors but if your boss likes you it's possible.)  I also managed some other contractors (again, not normal) and it was very easy."
good,its an amazing place to work as peers are really collaborative and there is work life balance as well. there is nothing much I can tell.. you can experience yourself when you join :)
good,"It's important to note that Microsoft builds platforms. So if you want to build platforms, this is a great place to work. For those looking to build solutions on top of platforms, be very careful what team you join. Microsoft is a successful tech giant that has transformed its culture, goals, and direction in just 5 short years. It's a great place to learn, and a great place to make big impact. But you need to be self driven, assertive, and very open to change."
good,Insgesamt sehr guter Arbeitgeber mit modernem Arbeitsplatz
good,"Strong company values, great teamwork, supportive management and great leadership, love the flexibility and trust between the teams, great cooperation in reaching shared goals"
good,"The quality of your experience, as with any job, depends on your goals, your manager, your team, and your specific work assignments. If one of the latter 3 Is poor, the other 2 can compensate. If 2 of the latter 3 are poor, you are gonna be unhappy and leave or move roles. Managers can be great or terrible as anywhere, and the culture, work life balance, and work vary greatly between orgs, products, and teams. If you are hardworking and excited about the product you work on, it can be a great! There are many different kinds of opportunities, especially near Redmond main campus."
good,"Microsoft is a great employer in Ireland. Over the years the company has evolved and has put a lot of effort into employee wellness. There are good benefits and a lot of opportunities to learn and expand your skillset. Unfortunately, the group I was in had redundancies or I would still be there."
good,The people are super smart and so passionate about technology. They get excited to see gadgets and to use latest and bleeding edge technology. Be ready to always be in the unknown as there is new advancement in they way work is done and technology will change you
good,"la considero una delle più belle esperienze della mia vita. Testavo giochi della Xbox e facevo attenzione al cliente, eravamo in spagna, dunque parlavo con il cliente in italiano, con i colleghi spagnolo e dovevamo scrivere in inglese. tutto molto stimolante per la mente."
good,"Typical day, go into work, synch up all related files so everything I was working with was up-to-date. Then proceed to bring the cars up to the final 10 percent, to get them all functioning ingame. Involved setting up lighting, textures and shader work, animation, replacing parts as manufacturers wanted, livery, optimizations, some of the more technical aspects like alpha sorting of glass."
good,"Employee oriented and customer focused/obsessed."
good,"great working with Microsoft, I learnt a lot from this company including retail market, knowledge about electronics both hardware and software."
good,Tons of different teams/products to work on. Fairly good work/life balance. Lots of opportunities to work on high visibility projects early on in my career. Lots of resources available for early in career growth. Great perks. Good benefits
good,"Microsoft is a truly great company with an interesting mix of challenges.  Expectations are high for following a disciplined sales process.  Opportunities to mentor others and to be mentored are valued and available.  It's a consuming workplace.  Don't expect to realize a great work/life balance.  Much will be demanded of you, if you are to stay and advance in your career."
good,A MS é uma empresa ótima para se trabalhar e iniciar uma carreira.
good,There are a lot of opportunities at Microsoft but you have to be able to manage them and get yourself in position to take advantage of them.  Your manager is your best leverage.
good,"Fast paced complex environment."
good,I have learned a lot good things there such a very good control of inventories.  The environment at work is so good.  You feel very comfortable working with different people around the world.  I liked a lot to work with people from different cultures.
good,"Lots of comradeship, many employees try to help one another, but you really do not get credit for it so be careful to always make sure you are covered."
good,"Good place overall. Just like any company, there is always room for improvement. Career advancement could be alot better. Benefits are great. Management is good most of the time."
good,ambiente distendido de trabajo.Pocos proyectos generados
good,"We had excellent teams and resources, very close nit community makes for multiple contact points facing customers. Very large organization always has new opportunities for advancement"
good,I really liked working at Microsoft during my time there.  They have great pay and benefits and an excellent focus on how to create great solutions for great customers.  I did not like the travel as a Microsoft Consultant.  Way too much.
good,"Awesome culture and learning opportunity."
good,"I interned at Microsoft as a Summer High School Intern. Most of my day consisted of writing code for an investigative project I was assigned to. It was challenging work, and I got to work hands on with some new programming languages, like XML, while doing the analysis. I enjoyed the struggle and learning process, and even got to present my work to management, which was nice."
good,The company is very efficient and staff is professional. New technology comes out very often and it’s affordable to the consumer purchasing it. It is in high demand and beats competitors with pricing and placement.
good,The culture at Microsoft is like no other place I have worked before. The work environment is very positive and upbeat. This makes going to work enjoyable instead of being a drag.
good,"Great People"
good,Senior leadership was great about cultivating a culture that aligned with the companies values. The work environment felt like a large family that took care of each other. Middle management didn’t always align their actions with senior leaderships vision and direction.
good,"Great Job, I enjoyed working with Microsoft and it was one of the best job I ever had. The travel was more then I expected, the position was a new program and they added more stores to route."
good,I enjoyed working on a variety of teams during my time a Microsoft.  Microsoft has a wide variety of products and it is very easy to switch teams internally.
good,"Most professional , driven company I have worked for , quality of management superb. Conditions and benefits are really flexible, technology as you would expect is superb."
good,"Microsoft has the best workplace culture. They do make sure their employees keep up with the latest and greatest by providing them opportunities to grow thru hackathons and conferences as well as flexibility to work with other teams in different locations. I believe they choose the best people in the Managerial positions. They make sure that what they do is in accordance to best practices, programmatically, architecturally, ethically and humanly possible."
good,I felt the culture was amazing and the name definitely held up to the actual experience working with the Applications Team. Bellevue is right around the corner and it just felt like Paradise for a Programmer
good,Great company. The culture is very welcoming and they create a positive work life balance for employees. The most enjoyable part of my job is the opportunity to learn every day whilst being constantly challenged.
good,"Travail formateur et enrichissant."
good,"The problem as far as I could gather was never Microsofts fault. They demanded a standard of excellence and convergys was unable to provide that due to the recruiters and upper management. My direct managers and the people sent over from Microsoft genuinely cared and tried to help. However, at every turn convergys upper management always seemed to be a problem. There was a lot of folks with ego issues within upper management that wanted to constantly flex control and micromanage even though things made zero sense. Due to this, the good talent left as soon as they could. Microsoft and the people that they sent over though were great and really tried to help. They always went above and beyond and most of the time felt sympathetic for us due to what we had to deal with. In the end the contract was canceled by Microsoft and rightfully so."
good,"Work life was great, colleagues made it very enjoyable. It is fast-paced enough for the time to fly, but not enough to be stressful. I would definitely recommend it."
good,"It is really Great Company to work with. "
good,"Good working environment working at Microsoft, good mannagemnt and learning oppartunity..."
good,Microsoft is a great diverse company with amazing learning exp with diverse culture and benefits . since I was in staffing and recruitments it gave me a lot of exposure to meet and interview people from across globes . Microsoft always helped with updating technologies with seminar
good,"Typical day at work is very relaxed unless there is a sales focus."
good,"Microsoft was my first job and I got learned a lot there with huge experience and motivation, they give me the responsibility to take decision to improve one of the most active programs in Microsoft Middle East and I was connected with more than 40 countries and support them and improve their productivity"
good,"I joined when the company had only 4000 employees and grew by 10 times. it was a vibrant, exciting, and well managed company that thrives to this day."
good,i have done many different things from manufacturing to body modification. this job was by far the best thing i have ever been able to do. the environment matches one you would find at a best buy but the experience and the pace is extremely slowed down. customer engagement is at a level where you can sit one-on-one with a customer to truly figure out what they need. except during holidays of course............
good,Always something going on at the campus. Give you a chance to always network. Teams are also very supportive. Have to be eager to learn because there is always something new going on and something new to learn.
good,Plenty to learn here with a lot of room for advancement or even just learning new roles within the company. Always kept busy and was able to learn plenty of new things.
good,"- great training,competitive wages. They give you a product to be able to use when you're selling in order to try. i would recommend any students looking for part time gigs to try this out"
good,"Empresa agradável, com boa gestão e bom atendimento interno."
good,"Typical day at work is you grab your morning cup of joe, meet with your managers and partners. I learned more in my internships than all the classes I took in college. The culture at work is shifting more and more each year towards cloud computing and online software. Nothing really bad to say about the company."
good,"Typical day at work starts with morning stand-up. Talking about the day's budget, giving out some ""kudos"" to fellow employees that have done some great stuff lately. Talking about Microsoft in the news and the upcoming events and products. Throughout the day you work with customers and help resolve their problems with over the top customer service. In today's world, people need their computers. We are here to help when things go wrong!"
good,It is very fun and enjoyable work place. People were very nice and helping each other when needed. I have learned a lot of new technology about the products.
good,"Everything was great at Microsoft except having to meet sales goals. I'm not an experienced sales person, so I didn't always excel at that. This led to me being released from my contract."
good,"It was fun working for Microsoft, except for certain people working there like an acting manager that basically doesn't know that part of being a manager is also working and helping his people."
good,"Microsoft is not a company it is an Academy you can spend your live with by working and learning all the way."
good,It was great to work at Microsoft. All around great culture and leadership. My only complaint would be the lack of upward mobility in my specific sales channel.
good,It may sound like a cliche but every day is different. The worrk is diverse and the interactions with other individuals and groups ensure you can develop you knowledge.
good,"This was an amazing position, unfortunately I ran up against Microsoft 18 month rule for Vendor personnel. I enjoyed all facets of this position and the team I worked with was incredible."
good,"Worked as a student for Senior Design. Did not work directly with Microsoft but for a consulting company, Avanade, that worked with Microsoft. That being said, I did enjoy my meetings with my team members and Sponsor meeting where my team and I would meet with representatives from Avanade to discuss progress."
good,"Cutting edge technologies, constant innovation, high pressure environment. Opportunity to learn from the best across the world. Need to be on your toes all the time."

good,"Very Productive and workPlace culture, Its in organized manner with most updated new technologies."
good,I enjoy working at Microsoft. I feel like it is a place where you can grow and gain so many new skill for career development.  It is a fast paced stressful environment but the benefits really outweigh what you have to put into it.
good,"Communicating with vendors in different countries with different time zone is a challenging task. Dealing with daily issues related to vendor performance and analyzing lots of data in order to keep spending of customer's care within budget is another challenge since you only have tools that may enable you to see figures which some times can not be reliable enough to manage the daily operation. Emails and meeting with cross function team give more insight about what to expect when launching new product and coordinate the activities between sales team and customer care. It is joyful feeling when successful launch of new product or when a software update is completed successfully after hard work between factory, development team and technical team."
good,Always found challenge and new opportunities each day. Team communication is excellent. Supporting staffs are very nice and cordial. Office is very relaxing and nice.
good,"Good temp job online, my assignment was a temp situation. But I did take some direction directly from Microsoft and it was very professional. The work was basically customer service for xbox"
good,"Work culture is really good, no micro management . working with professionals is a great learning experience. taking a break and play ping pong or some other indoor activity is a great refreshment at Microsoft."
good,Esta empresa tem um ótimo ambiente de trabalho além de ter um trabalho de gestão de pessoas muito bom visando sempre crescimento pessoal e profissional dos funcionários.

good,Great work place with amazing co-workers and leaders. Always fun coming to work to get the job done and achieve our goals for the day. Good work days.
good,"I love Microsoft, and have given 10 years to the company. The last few positions have been great leadership and teammates. The downside is this 18/6 month vendor rule. This is the 2nd time I've had to endure it, and I can't wait 6 months. This time, my break started the day before Thanksgiving. There were openings in the team and I was referred by an FTE but nothing happened. I guess that's the only pitfall. I'm excited about new opportunities for other tech companies."
good,"Unlimited career advancement, great place to work, excellent benefits, exciting technology, interesting challenges, continuous growth, brand recognition"
good,"Great place to work at, great company and benefits. working with this company has been great.  hardest part of the time is to job work.life balance. consistently working too much"
good,Great place to experience technology development at its best. You will be busy and expectations are high. Great people to meet and learn from. This company is always evolving.
good,"It was a nice time, no issues at all.  Between the nice offices and the rather affordable, excellent meals offered at the Microsoft cafe, I'd definitely try to find another job there again, for sure."
good,"Microsoft was a great company to work for. If you love technology, Microsoft is the place for you. Microsoft benefits were great and people love to collaborate to ensure the success of the company."

good,Productive work place with good work life balance. Good benefits and compensation. Good environment to work with stayfit perks. Good insurance and other benefits.
good,"Compared to many retail jobs out on the market, Microsoft is one of the best. For part time sales associates (product advisors) you get stock options, health insurance, vision and dental insurance. The benefits make you feel like you actually work for Microsoft, as they include you in all the perks corporate employees get."
good,"All of the below mentioned points vary by the team you work with. Here are some of mine:"
good,"Microsoft is an amazing company, and it is often a shock to people coming in that they are suddenly working with people just as smart and motivated as they are (if not more so). It is an intense environment, and one where you will never sit on your laurels. It is a great place to work, but definitely not for the faint of heart. They will work you hard, but they will reward you accordingly."
good,"I had a contract job at Microsoft and would love to go back. They've come a long way in the past 10 years in terms of a kinder, gentler culture. There are too many layers of management, but they're working on that, too."
good,"Here work culture is very freedom, you can learn what you want."
good,"I found Microsoft to be a great place to work.  Job advancement was hard mostly due to our location and lack of any nearby stores so it was hard to advance without a position opening up.  Workplace culture was good, as well as good work life balance.  Management was great especially the store manager."
good,"I learned so much and met amazing people from everywhere. Sad being a vendor with 18 month contract, but with everything you learn, it is a great jumping off place for a different position, and a wake up call to the importance of a traditional education."
good,"My time at Microsoft was great for a long time, until I got re org'd under a new manager who I didn't see eye to eye with and so I had to leave the company."
good,Had lot of exciting time in Microsoft. Great opportunity to explore & learn new technologies. Flexible work culture. Chance to work with some of great minds.
good,"Microsoft is a great place to work. The people I worked with were the best we could have ever hoped for, and were extremely hard workers. While there was healthy competition, we were all there helping each other be successful.  Awesome team."

From the partner network, to the customers to the employees, there is no company that has a greater impact on technology than Microsoft.

Living in the Redmond area I see this every day."

good,"A typical day at work consisted of resolving complicated issues such as, troubleshoot issues, investigating unknown issues, etc. I learned how to work well in a large team, teaching others how to work with our system, leading groups of coworkers to be more efficient. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, since we had to work closely we were able to build a great work relationship and it pushed us to work harder as a team. The hardest part of my job was when unknown issues couldn't be resolved right away due to not having a sufficient amount of people available to assist. Also, when we had to test new apps and there were many issues. The most enjoyable part of my job was resolving issues , building towards goals and finding ways to be more efficient as an individual and also as a team!"
good,"Great workplace with room for advancement. Working for Microsoft was eventful, different, and a varied experience.While management was not as attentive as possible, the executives are extremely open to new ideas,"
good,"Being privileged to work in the finance department for a software company, the atmosphere is slightly more relaxed and quieter while still maintaining a high level of professionalism. Our hours are flexible depending on deadlines like month end closing for example. The management treat all employees with the highest level of respect and praise.

We generally are incredibly busy with journal entries and nominal postings for our consolidated accounts. "

Although I worked in a support role, the job was extremely varied and no two days were the same.  The flexible work culture was a breath of fresh air and being able to manage my own schedule without being micromanaged was extremely liberating.  The opportunities, even for an intern, were extensive and I was fortunate enough to spread my wings and get involved in other parts of the business with colleagues."
good,"That was the great management and Great place ever. i did work on contract base and more clearly with third party. Microsoft also gives you a chance to invent more things. so that's why it was a 6 months contract base job in which we learned code & many more. So, that was the just fantastic."
good,Great culture. Great learning environment. Quality people. Fast paced and surrounded by the latest in technology. Great communication tools at the office.
good,"I always do my best, will to upgrade myself"

good,"At work we take calls, making sure customers are satisfied and getting the resources that are needed. We notate and send various emails and reports to executives. We are a team and we do have fun, but we work hard. The hardest part of the day would have to be making sure that SLA's are being met, seeing that it does not just depend on us if they are met or not. I love the fact that we all work good together, and we hire within the company which makes it easier to move up."

good,"This is a fun place to work with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside great people and learning from them. There was also a wide range and variety in what I did day to day ranging from being a project owner of a task to team collaboration that was challenging and exciting!"

Management was awesome, always willing to help and stay calm.  The only thing that sucked was that we got all of our jobs shipped to the phillipines because they were cheaper apparently.    i would have stayed with xbox for life"

good,"A typical work day involves creating training programs and rich content for Design Agencies, working with Design Agencies to help identify areas for improving our products and services, and developing new programs to excite and delight our target audiences. I learned that even the best programs are sometimes limited in scope based on budget priorities and that most coworkers are willing to provide insights and expertise based on their own learnings.

After my training was over my, I was given the option to stay over and do my homework with a tutor. If I stayed, I was paid extra. So it was an awesome program and I would recommend it to anyone."
good,"I created a project for Microsoft in using agile methodology, the main goal of that project was to detect the problems and flaws in popular news apps such as wsj and NYT and raise an alert to proper tier of people who can fix it, and thereby saving $3M+/year for Microsoft. Microsoft already had a tool called Keynote which was doing the same job. But, It had few issues major issues were like cost, complexity, reliability. Reliability issue (false positive and repetitive alerts) was unknown until we started working on it. I took the responsibility to work on that problem and I ended up created an algorithm which fixed all reliability problems we had. They liked it, and later on the algorithm was included in all of the monitoring tools our team used. “it was One of my major achievements as a sw developer” . I developed an algorithm that solved this problem. to avoid false positive alerts“the algorithm calculates percentage of availability of news app on timely basis and when it crosses the minimum percentage it then it throws the alert to proper tier of people, and creates a threshold to suppress the same alert for next 1 hour(i created a config file so its customizable) this solves the repetitive alerts problem"

good,"Work was very customer involved and fast paced, working as a team is key, and celebrating the wins of each day, and giving perspective and learning with a growth mindset."
good,"Microsoft is an incredibly demanding company but also an amazing place to work. As a technologist having access to Microsoft Research gives you a view of what technologies will be available 5-10 years down the road and was one of the reasons I stayed as long as I did. Its also one of the most ethical companies I've worked for more reasons than I can list here. I was in a position that allowed me to work from home when I wasn't traveling (which was frequently). Lots of little perks, especially if you can work anywhere at or around the headquarters in the Seattle area. The only real downside (besides the demanding nature of the company) is that management can be very hit or miss, I had one of the top two best managers in my career at Microsoft, and also one of my top two worst managers in my career at Microsoft, so make sure you interview your hiring manager if you're applying."

good,"I got this position from working events with 24 Seven Inc marketing company in New york City. Since the launch of Surface Pro in time square, I was able to network and grow in my knowledge of the devices and tech support. A typical day as a regional manager was heading to the mall early, setting up each devices for the employees and being available to help on the floor while customers interacted with the brand ambassadors. This position was a unique season position created to interact with a diversity of customers who were interested with the Surface tablet and Nokia phones. I enjoyed the pace and experience gained from managing and tech support / maintenance of the events in the mall.

good,"For the volume/complexity/difficulty of the effort - capturing and processing high volumes of continuous street side and aerial imaging - this was the best managed I have ever seen.  By far some of the most knowledgeable software developers with whom I have worked.  Especially unusual and impressive was the dynamic environment driving toward best solutions.  If you had a better idea and could back it up with reason, historical data, logic, etc., the direction of the project could be changed the same day your idea is presented.  Microsoft maintained a top notch team and gave you the freedom to be creative.  If you didn't perform within reasonable expectations, you didn't stay.  Would have loved to stay, the effort I was hired to support was completed."

The workplace culture really demanded a lot of initiative and persistence to push goals through the end-zone. The hardest part of the job was helping mitigate fallout to partner companies when top-down priorities and resource availability changed by upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job was constantly discovering and connecting with smart, passionate people that approached problems and opportunities with an open mind and were not afraid to present differing viewpoints but like-minded in terms of working towards common ground and practical solutions."

good,This was a temporary position as front desk receptionist.  It was very clean and had really nice amenities. Was very enjoyable place with great people to work with.

The only downfall was being away for 4 weeks at a time."
good,I was on a short project-based gig. The team I worked with was amazing and I would happily go back to the team if they had any future needs. I had a great experience.
good,Enjoyed the people and enjoyed the work.  Tend to feel like part of a machine and it has lost a lot of it personality over the years but can't beat the pay.

good,"Muy buena interaccion, ejecucion y clara estrategia. Una verdadera empresa global."
good,"Dress codes are practically non-existent for non-customer facing roles and micro-management pretty much doesn't exist...because, to be honest, your managers are too damned busy to watch over your shoulder.

You have access to huge amounts of training material and Microsoft has a very generous tuition reimbursement policy...got my BS and MBA completely on their dime."

The management was excellent, the staff was excellent, the benefits was excellent, the information learned was outstanding, and the experience is one of kind. However, the opportunity to grow and become something more than a product advisor seemed bleak. Throughout my 2 years as a product advisor, I only witness approximately 4 people grow from their position as product advisor with a staff of 45 individuals. For me, that shows that the company was not willing to lose product advisors for other opportunities, even within the company. Otherwise, great place to work if you have plans to remain in one position with little room to move up. For many, that may not be an issue. For me, that was the deal breaker."

If you  like working on emerging technology but need to spend time with family, then this is the place you need to be! With that in mind, As a consultant, you're still subjected to all the stuff that comes with it (18 month rule, fiscal year layoffs, project not sustaining budget, re-organization, etc.)"
good,"Microsoft è un azienda molto bella sia come estetica sia come lavorativa, ci sono belle persone simpatiche e divertenti, ben organizzati."
good,"Unfortunately, my boss left the company and I am now looking for a job both inside and outside of Microsoft."
good,"In mijn periode bij Microsoft heb ik de explosieve groei en de succesjaren meegemaakt. De organisatie was nog vrij plat en kende korte communicatielijnen. Grote mate van autonomie."
good,"Every day you were trusted to manage your own schedule based on your workload. This provided people the opportunity to learn about leading your own business unit which was approximately 350 employees. Management trusted that you were doing a good job and were there in case of escalations or other support. One time when I had too much on my plate I let my manager know so that could have a proactive notification of where any escalations and/or complaints may come from in the client groups. When a complaint did arise from lack of bandwidth my manager stood behind me. My team was built of knowledgeable HR professionals that existed like a family always there to support each other."
good,HIgh pressure enviroment with HIgh results required in sales and account management by interacting with high C level executives.
good,"This was a fun and challenging company to work for. They gave me a project, then free reign to finish it as I saw fit, including access to information and people which was truly amazing. I would not have thought that a company like Microsoft would be so open about their issues, but it made my life significantly easier and created for a great environment to help them succeed."
good,"Challenges every day regardless of the role I played.  Loved solving them. Team development was one of the best parts of my day.  I learned like I was in college only with real world results.  Loved my co-workers, generally had great management role models.  Loved to travel and work internationally.  Continually stretched and motivated to do more."
good,A typical work hour day was 7am-7pm with the understanding that you would be reachable online after these hours.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being supported by my Directors in thinking up and initiating new processes to save the company money and time.  I always had a reliable team that would support our goals and we respected and supported each other throughout my time at Microsoft.  The hardest part of the job was the work/home life balance and finding qualified people to do the job.  You can train skill sets but you cannot train laziness.  Management is tricky as you can't manage people to do work for you.  You have to motivate them to want to do work for the team and drive their desire to keep working on new and exciting projects.
good,"What can I say?  Microsoft was by far the most challenging and rewarding company to work for."
good,"Best to learn thrive and earn !!"

good,"GREAT PACE TO WORK!! It's fast- paced, I've learned a lot about selling techniques, management is wonderful and very helpful. And the co-workers are great to work with as well as very helpful and knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job is to contain yourself from having so much fun. The enjoyable part of the job is having way too much fun."

good,"Although ""Working"" as a Xbox Ambassador doesn't give pay and is totally optional to the person it does give amazing opportunities to advance in or start to get some experience in Communication Skills and Social Skills for Customer Care."
good,"I have loved my time at Microsoft. I enjoyed the flexible hours and high level of trust instilled in employees. Employees are encouraged to ""fall forward"" go out on a limb and take risks. My coworkers were all highly intelligent proactive people that I respected. That made the biggest difference in my interactions. People acted extremely professionally and did not take things personally or get involved in office politics, that I saw... It should be noted I worked as a contractor (v-dash)"
good,"Great group of men that I support from an administrative standpoint.  From purchasing product, understanding all the internal logistics and applications, travel, shipping, tracking, and event planning."
good,"- Flexibilidad en horario, el foco esta en el logro de los objetivos y en el cumplimiento de las políticas y cultura de la familia Microsoft"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of daily sales of Xbox and Surface. Customers would come to the store and ask questions about our products or would need help updating their OS on either Surfaces, PC's, Xbox One or Windows Phones. I learned about time management and a lot of leadership. By making sure the store stays on top with sales or promotions I would email the team making sure we stay up to par and making sure we give the right information to our customers. The hardest part of the job could be having slow traffic at our location. Slow traffic could usually occur during the beginning of the week but by having limited customers we would do whatever it takes to get the sale as well as having attachments. Most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers about the Xbox One. Being able to show customers the greatness of the Xbox One and showing them how efficient it can be for our customers really excite me."
good,Great team atmosphere that is very productive. The management is friendly and productive.

good,"Fun to come to work, staff is nice and helpful, employees help each other"
good,The company has an awesome level of energy flowing through it. Love working here.
good,"I have to admit that Microsoft felt more like fun than work back in the mid 90's and they were just the little guy trying to grab share.  As the company grew they had to standardize how the business was operated and became a little more ""corporate"".  Still a great company to which I owe huge debt of product knowledge and memories of great experiences."
good,"Opened the computer, priorities the task: Emails"
good,"No any typical day."

good,"During those 13 years at Microsoft I've worked with the most knowledgebale people and worked with some of the biggest banks and most critical SQL environment in the world. "
good,"Although faced with challenges of a small business, as a team, we had to act with the speed, professionalism and ethics of a large company. The Microsoft Dynamics division is almost a startup inside the very well established Microsoft. I participated on plannings, created my own project, had huge responsabilities and autonomy that no other big company would be able to provide me as an intern. I've learned to take chances and how to not be afraid of mistakes. The biggest mistake you can ever make is the one of avoinding change. Sometimes the lack of resources would come as a difficulty, however, with creativity, we would always find solutions to the most important issues. I've also learned how to prioritize and work with multiple campaigns and tasks."
good,I am encouraged to show creativity and supported in unconventional ventures.
good,"Work at Microsoft is very fun and this company does an amazing job at motivating it's employees. I learned a lot about technology during my assignment, including Microsoft Office, various PCs and community and business development. Management did an amazing job accommodating every single one of their employees, including the temp hires. Hardest part of the job was cramming in SO MUCH information in the 5 months I was there; however, it was not impossible and the resources available made learning easier. My favorite part of working at Microsoft was how the company runs on diversity and that we were encouraged to learn, to further become experts in sales and technology."

good,"Good Place to work.I am working as a vendor from past 2 year, i am not much happy with my work."
good,Microsoft workplace is very nice.Currently i am working on BizTalk Server product in Microsoft IDC.
good,"The vendor and contractor experience is great at Microsoft, i got to work at various groups from Music, cloud services to taxes but the vendor conditions is not secure employment"
good,"Even though the title is given as SDETII, the job is equivalent to a PM / QA Manager , and a Developer. It really good and interesting job as we get to learn more about different aspects of technology and leadership , It will be very difficult to get the work done when it comes to work with other Division's of Microsoft, other than the group where I work. Its equivalent to working with a client in smaller sized companies. Its my pleasure to work for Microsoft. the only disadvantage is the climate here in Redmond and also work life balance is out of sync, due to the nature of the job."
good,"Loved working for arvato company , many opportunities to go higher up the ladder, friendly staff"
good,"Smart, Driven, Creative People. Always exciting, always competitive - inside and out. Rarely a dull moment when working on teams, against other team, versus outside competitors."

good,Microsoft is the top company for new IT approach and services in the Cloud. Very demanding but with an open environment where people can participate and provide ideas to improve the services that MS offers.
good,Microsoft game testing helped me understand testing environments and conditions even from the most basic view of it. Thank to Microsoft I found a passion that I plan to pursue.
good,"Nothing bad to say, Didn’t pay enough to afford to live in LA, but then again, no one does. It was the best job I’ve ever had. 10/10 recommend. Wonderful team, wonderful culture."
good,I worked for Microsoft for almost ten years before I retired. My boss was great and I learned a lot from him. My team was super nice and it was fun to work with them. I highly recommend Microsoft as a good place to work. Also their benefits are great.
good,The company set me up for success in the MBA College leadership development program. I worked in NYC and had the opportunity to work with great company leaders in technology to drive their overall competitiveness.
good,I have very much enjoyed my role at Microsoft.  The culture has changed immensely for the better.  I love it here!  Very strong global company definitely maintaining its leadership position in technology!

good,"It is really enjoyable working here at Microsoft. The teammates and colleagues across the company is very helpful. I have learned a lot of technical skills pertaining to SharePoint as well as soft skills while working at Microsoft. Workplace culture is friendly and welcoming for newcomers. The hardest part of the job was being at on call duty for 24/7 for a week by rotation which is also rewarding given the fact that engineers had a chance to solve real customer problems which helped them a lot with their understanding of the large project like sharepoint, Most enjoyable part is the freedom and ability to work on new components and availability of abundant resources to work with as well as the ping pong table and retro-games to play with co-workers"
good,"My typical day at work involves multi-tasking to meet deadlines. I typically address multiple issues during my day, aside from the main work that I'm doing."
good,"I have completed two rotations at Microsoft, and it has only gotten better. The new leadership from CEO on down is remarkable compared to the early 2000's."
good,"Great atmosphere to work in. I learned a lot about working with multiple teams and coordinating schedules for meetings. The value of virtual meetings cannot be underestimated. My management was great! The job can be challenging when dealing with multiple groups, but that is also a part of growing. Meeting all of the different people on the teams was a lot of fun."
good,The company during my time there was outstanding. They were youth in the retail world however wiling to learn along the way to success. Every level of the company strived to be a part of something special. And that mentality still exist today.
good,"Excellent workplace with people who are always having fun as they work. If you are not the competitive type, however, you will quickly be weeded out. Everything is a competition with your colleagues from sales numbers to almost everything else you do. Every morning you are compared to everyone else in terms of who made top sales. In my honest opinion this creates a negative self view. If you've sold 4 Xbox's, but your friend sold a Surface studio, it doesn't matter, they made top sales. This is my true one and only gripe. Microsoft is fantastic and the growth potential is practically infinite. If you love technology and want to be with people who are creative in their own right, there is no better company to be with than Microsoft."
good,Cant say enough great things about this work place.  At Microsoft you truly get the opportunity to do you very best work.  Great leaders encourage you to live the mission and make a difference in peoples lives.

good,"Empowering, Structured yet flexible. Goal oriented, Ethical,  As a field based employee, I had a great experience as an employee for 18+ years.  The Redmond experience may be different, but the field sales organization was great."

good,"Excellent place to work.  Lots of perks, great benefits including 50% retirement match for 401k.  Good food, great leadership.  Only downside is not a lot of training in Finance org"
good,"The time spent working for Microsoft, has opened a world of opportunities for me and has helped me develop from a professional point of view. Great managers, great colleagues and a great experience overall."
good,"When a company has a good culture, it doesn't matter the level, the employees will follow. I have never been sad to leave a retail job until I started working for the Microsoft stores. They provide all types of training from basic software to certificate training to their employees. Management is extremely supportive and will do all they can for you to succeed and reach your goals. Free drinks and snacks and on occasion we had free lunches. Great benefits which included free health care. All of this for a part time position. The only thing I would mention is that there is a divide from retail to corporate. I wish they could offer more opportunities or at least a 'bridge' for those who want to move up from retail to the corporate level."

good,Microsoft is a great place to work especially if you have just left college.  Although admins are treated well they are not given the same compensation as other employees and there is not a lot of opportunity to advance past an admin role.  I would recommend it as a great place to work though .
good,"I landed at Microsoft as a result of an acquisition. Started on a transitional contract with all benefits of a full time employee. I left when my contract expired, though I was offered a position in the company at the end of my contract. The only reason not to accept is that I had already accepted another one."

I have the pleasure of working with some incredibly talented individuals on complex and challenging problems, have learned a lot, and have made a good deal of money doing it."

good,it was very interesting as it was my first intern during college.
good,"My typical day at work is crazy. There are so many different projects going on with shifting priorities and timelines. It's really hard to stay on top of all of it. The team I work with makes the extra effort to be available and ready to support when extra assistance is needed. This makes the work environment really fun to be a part of. Even though it seems stressful to work on so many projects all at once, when you deliver on time, against tight timelines and high stakes, it feels great. I've been a part of some big wins within MS advertising operations and you can't match that kind of feeling working on smaller scale projects. The hardest part of the job is aligning priorities with the rest of the team and external teams. Too often it seems as if conflicting priorities will result in a less efficient separation of duties. Collaboration is the most important component in delivering quality products on time and aligning priorities is integral in driving alignment between business teams. These are the values I have observed and been a part of at MS. It's been one of the greatest opportunities I have ever had to work along side professionals of this caliber. The best part of the job was all the recognition and support I got from management. They never hesitate to call it out when some one puts in the extra effort. A lot of work places have systematic ways to evaluate performance, which is nice, but getting acknowledged in an environment with tried and tested professionals is often more rewarding than other forms of compensation."
