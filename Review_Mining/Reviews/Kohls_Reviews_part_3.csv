I worked with an amazing team of associates as well as outstanding management. Troubleshooting and resolving issues were my favorite parts of my job.

The managers and co-worker are great. they are willing to help each other. The most enjoyable apart of my job is being around the public.
good,Everyone you work with is so friendly and kind. They are willing to help you with whatever you need. Managers there actually care about what you say and they take interest in your life outside of work. I learned how to use the machines there and how to manage a work area. I think the hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers but you get that anywhere but the managers will always stand up for you. The most enjoyable thing about the job is the volunteer work you can do there. I signed up for everyone of them. They were so much fun and it really makes you feel great to be doing some good work for your company.
good,"I had a great experience working for this company, ask me if i would work there again.... yes definitely."
good,if there was a kohl's here in pa I would site be working there is was fun and a learning exp. the only thing I didn't like it wasn't on a bus line so that others could or even myself could get there. the only reason im not there now is because the girl I use to ride with quit so I had no ride. if I had a car or it was on the bus line I would still be there. love working there

good,"A typical work day really depending on the day, any sales going on, it was always a little busy at some point throughout the shift, but you always got through it and treated every customer fairly and respectfully. Management here was great, you knew who to talk to for what and they helped you with anything you needed. My co-workers were great, I loved them dearly and enjoyed working with them. The most enjoyable part of the job was honestly talking to the customers, being real people and just having a genuine conversation; best part is being able to help someone out. The hardest part I would say is doing your best to get your job done with an unhappy customer; they may have had a bad experience but my job was to have them leave wanting to come back."
good,"Amazing company with great Associates!! The Associates always had a positive attitude, and they always had pot lucks when someone had a birthday. The customers loved shopping in the store, and management always made sure it was neat and tidy"
good,"Kohl's was always fun to work at. They always had competitions, gave back to the workers, gave compliments and motivated us to push for success.

good,"Day start with cleaning the counter and check the bags and get ready with new promotion update for that day. Learned to scan, open credit card for customer and reward card. Greet people and management is also there to help when required."
good,Everything was great. I learned how to drive different type of forklifts there. I enjoyed the work environment and the services they had to offer. They even made the 12 hour days during peak season fun. The only thing I didn't like about Kohl's was the fact that I didn't get enough hours of work outside of peak season.
good,Super fun work place! All my co workers and management were awesome and I definitely miss working there! Lots of deals and coupons for employees too.

The incentives and bonuses were always fun to work toward, and Kohl's works hard to keep staff morale up. I would always give this company thumbs up!"

good,"-Fun"
good,Iam working as EPM Sr. IT Project Program Manager and It was my pleasure to work in that environment. I enjoyed working there and got up new ideas and got myself trained.
good,A typical day was just making sure the safe balanced. I learned what happens behind the scenes and I appreciate the way retail works. The management team was great they made sure we were informed of the daily goals and how we could achieve it. My coworkers were amazing always wiling to help. The hardest part was trying to explain the policies to customers but I always found a way for them to understand. The most enjoyable part was when the safe would balance and all the transactions were accounted for.
good,I would go to work in the mornings and run the reports for the day. Get all my employees on a module and make sure the orders were filled to be shipped. Great teamwork.
good,this company was the best company to work for. I would go work for them again in a heart beat. Management is always there for you know matter what
good,I loved working for Kohl's it is a great place to work. I work for Kohl's for many years but with a new born and one child in high school I wanted to be closer to home.
good,Fun because of getting to see all customer's needs and to provide education and assist customer's with skincare. Being able to learn about new products and display the new and up coming products and being the first to offer the latest and greatest products was fun. Being sent to Dallas Texas to learn from make-up artists about skincare and make-up and come back and provide customers with the knowledge I learned was rewarding.
good,"A fast paced environment, many different tasks you can complete in a day, interacting with many different people and a nice employee discount."
good,"helping customers with certain questions that they might have, making sure that they are satisfied and meeting our goal in sales and customer service."
good,"A typical day at Kohl's is getting a RF gun and going through my department and making sure my electronic sign's match the merchandise and the prices are correct. I then check the fitting rooms and put all merchandise back and into the departments that they belong. I then straighten my clothing that are on tables and fill in merchandise from my back stock. Working with the bosses and associates are fun and I enjoy it very much. I usually unload the truck one day a week as all department supervisors are required to do this. Currently we receive two trucks a week and during holidays it is one everyday...When I was hired at Kohl's I had no experience with working with clothing. To me there is always going to be something new to learn on a daily bases. I know how to do price changes and to check with other stores to see if there is merchandise that a customer is looking for that we may not have. The most difficult part of my job to me is putting out the new merchandise that comes in, I use a department book to help me merchandise the new items, but find it hard to understand the book as everything is displayed backwards. I feel I am getting better with merchandising and know it will all take time. The most rewarding part of my job is helping the customers and knowing they were satisfied with what I have helped them with. Customer service is the number one priority. I enjoy all I can do to help and feel a sense of satisfaction when I am done. I love the atmosphere of the management and associates that work with me.  I enjoy doing cash handling, and office type work..."

good,"Kohl's is a great place to work.  I have learned how to deal with people.  I have learned that every customer deserves an unlimited amount of time to explain themselves.  I have great respect for the people that work at Kohl's.  Kohl's is a fun, fast-paced working environment that isn't for everyone and brings the most out of people."
good,Really good place to work at and they are really flexible with your schedule. The managers are really great and easy to get along with! All the associates are fun to work with and get along with!
good,Kohls in Whittier is a great place to work.  The management is nice and fair.  Their communication is great and I feel like they are always looking our for their employees.  I would encourage anyone to work for this great company

good,I worked in the credit department. I would assist customer with applying for a Kohl's Charge Card. Being friendly and engaging in light conversation while submitting all the customers information in a timely manner.
good,"A typical day at kohls as  cashier is very bubbly , high energy  especially during holiday season which is so much fun and enjoyable to the job .

good,"Being a sales associate was a great challenging experience. Even though some times it was somewhat rocky. I got to work with different attitudes, it was a great setting overall."
good,"Ask people to open a credit card, email and more. The management is great, but the don't communicate to well together. The co-workers are awesome. The hardest part of my job is keeping the customers happy."
good,"Very good place to work if you are in college and looking for some extra money to get by. Very fun atmosphere, co workers are a blast to work with"
good,I've been there for 5 years. I know most of all the customers now. My hours are very flexible. I actually love the environment. It's easy. They have nice clothing.
good,typical day at work consists of putting out merchandise and taking care of customers. learn to work together as a team and how to handle situations. my management team is excellent  and my coworkers are as well we all work together very well kind of like a family. the hardest part about my job I don't think their really is one like some days are good and others are rough but at the end of the day I make it through the day with the backup of my excellent manager and coworkers.

good,"Each day I walked into Kohl's, I knew that a new journey was beginning. I absolutely loved the sense of family that I gained with my coworkers, however I did not enjoy soliciting credit, it greatly angered the customers even though it was pushed hard by management."
good,I would operate a cash register and take care of customers. I would answer there question and show them where merchandise was located in the store.
good,"I enjoy working at Kohl's in Jersey City Newport Mall, Great place to work at. I was able to bring my work retail experience at Kohl's and learned more about working at Kohl's."
good,I worked as a seasonal employee during black fridays and it was all organized and i had fun talking and working with everyone

Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I loved working at Kohl's. It was like a 2nd home to me. I went there when I was a child and then it was my first job. I just wish HR cared about their associates more.
good,"-A typical day at work consist of getting to work early, clocking in waiting for start up meeting by stretching and getting ready for the day, start up meetings job assignments/task for the day. Get job and then go do it, depending on the department you are working your day varies."
good,a productive work place been working at kohls for for 9 moths love that it a great place to work at the co-workers are fun and very easy to get alone with the hardest part of the job is that you have to make the customers are happy and help them look for stuff the management is wonderful i learned alot working at khols
good,Overall I loved working for this company. It was like a 2nd home to me and it is unfortunate HR doesn't care for the safety of their associates.
good,"I love the company structure with employee meets, volunteer programs and employee give backs discounts."
good,a typical day at work consist of me managing 5 large 18 wheelers and building walls with kohl store products  while making sure the products don't over fill on the main line of distribution while helping other co workers with jammed lines  the hardest part of the job ws the learning curve but I am a quick learner
good,Kohl's is a great place to work. My co-workers  and supervisors are nice and friendly. The atmosphere in the store is calm and relaxed. The most enjoyable part of the day is helping customers find merchandise. I also like when we have our promotions going on and customers are really excited about saving money. The hardest part of the job is when i can't satisfy a customer's needs. I always go above and beyond to help customer's in any way possible.
good,"I learend how to work inventory and be organized with a facility as big as Kohls Distrubution Center. My co workers were very friendly and easy to work with, my supervisers made it easy to work in a warehouse and trained me very well."
good,"greet and check out customers, learned how to work a complex register. management was good and so were my coe workers, alwys supportive. hardest part of the job is when you have nothing to do and you have folded and cleaned up all you can. the most enjoyable part of my job was the customers, they always put a smile on my face."
good,"I started working during the holiday season in customer service then transferred to the registers.  I loved the busy times and when it was slow we got to help out in other departments.

Hardest part about this job is coming out of your shell and engaging with the customer, but its not really hard. The best part of the job is the checks and bonuses! I bonus every month and probably made a few thousand extra last year in bonuses."

Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"As a member of management, you need to have the ability to be a multi tasker all the time. Can over see the hiring and developing of associates then unload truck process and merchandising of the freight while training new dept supervisors. Customer service goals and driving credit goals each day and then recovery the store from a busy day of business while trying to stay in the payroll budget."
good,"A typical day at work would be that I interact with all different kinds of personalities. I have learned that the customer is always right in a customer service environment such as this. The management team is very helpful with everything that I need to learn about customer service. My co-workers are now very good friends of mine. They encourage me to do what I need to do in order to have a successful work day. The hardest part of the job would be when I ask politely if customers would like to sign up for a Kohl's credit card. This credit card has many benefits but customers are either afraid of putting their social security into a computer or have not increased their credit score high enough. Signing customers up for this credit card makes the sales for the company go up, which increases pay roll, and then finally increases my hours there. There are many days where I do not sign anyone up for a credit card because they do not want it to effect their credit. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the flexible hours which compromises with my college classes."
good,"Working at Kohl's for my first job was tough, but a great experience! I only wish that I wasn't a seasonal employee so I could have worked there longer. If I was presented the opportunity to work at Kohl's again, I'd happily accept."

good,"Great place to work, the employees are just as great if not better. You can have slow or busy days it really just varies. The store itself has the best deals around there is always a sale."
good,"Fun place to work. You get on a personal level with customers and co-workers quickly, and management acknowledges your work."
good,This job is incredible. Everyone is friendly and you will get along with everyone. they have great prices and good customer service.
good,"One thing about Kohl's Corporation, loves kids and definitely gives back to the community...the had a team and go to different Walks to raise money for events for kids/Schools, reading to kids while in school."
good,Typical days at work involved us keeping the sales floor clean and being in charge of taking care of customers making sure they are satisfied.
good,"great place to work for, great management teams, great experience during my career. I would recommend working at Kohl's to anyone!"
good,It was a good place to work as long as you stayed to yourself and did your job. I never had problems. All of my co-workers were very helpful.

I have also learned how to communicate a little bit better with people. The management is really good, each manager has worked their way up to where they are from basically my position. They try their best to accommodate certain things needed. Not all of the co-workers are friendly, but I just keep to myself unless I need help.

good,A typical day at work was productive and fast paced but very enjoyable. I learned quite a bit from only a month of working at Kohl's. I learned how to operate the cash registers when i never had a chance before to learn about it because Kohl's was my first job. I also learned how to get along with co-workers as well as managers and customers and i learned everything i needed to know about Kohl's so i was able to communicate with the customers. Management was extremely helpful when i didn't know something. My co-workers were very nice and respectful towards me as well as customers. I didn't really find the job hard or I didn't find anything to be the hardest part of the job because i enjoyed everything. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably being able to work considering i have never worked before Kohl's and it was a definitely enjoyable experience for me.

good,"I learned a lot while working at kohls, I learned that its a hard job that can be very rewarding or very hard. I learned that being in stores overnight while they are closed doing price changes & sets are not the most enjoyable thing. "
good,"A typical day at work would be greeting customers, organizing merchandise, cashier duties, answering phone. I have learned that it is a joy to always help others, team work really goes a long way. Management is informative to there fellow workers, kind and caring to customers and/or very helpful and understanding. Co-workers are independent, share and work well with others. The hardest part of the job is not being able to complete work load all in a day or not being able to find what the customers request are. The most enjoyable day is to find and help what anyone needs. Smiling, accomplishing job task and or supporting management and co-workers. I believe as long as you treat others with respect it can define you and make you and others enjoy there day."

I learned how to sort out items in inventory and to manage certain areas of the store like my department, Shoes! My co-workers really took a liking to me and they always had a good day at work. I would venture to say that the more rigorous part of the job was ironically my job which was Shoes. Every time it got chaotic like on a Black Friday for example someone , me of course, had to find all the scattered items and arrange them back to their appropriate positions.  I think my staff was the most fun part. They kept me smiling and made me look forward to working within my department!!"

The Managers are always ready to help and desire to honor every coupon, my Co-workers are also good people to work with, they always have a story to tell... lol but I enjoy working with them . For me The hardest part of any job is ourselves, no job can be hard if we believe we can do it or put love in doing it, we must enjoy every aspect of our job because that's our choice, it's a daily work. if we don't enjoy it nothing will work and the job will not be well done. that's my opinion!"

There wouldn't be a hard part about working at Kohl's because it was an easy job, the staff is friendly they make you feel comfortable to work there.

good,A typical day at Kohl's is simply easy. I punch into the time clock to start my shift. Than go and work in the area that i am scheduled to work in that day. I also cover breaks for example if somebody at customer service needs to take a 15 minute break i work in that area until they return. I learned great customer service at Kohl's and how to work in different departments without supervision.There should always be good team work in any working environment.I felt like the hardest part was dealing with very angry customers but once i talked to them and told them about our policies they understood and came back. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and putting smiles on peoples faces because that is our main goal to make sure our customers had a great day shopping with us and come back.

Management is very reliable and there weather you need them or not they have the most knowledge and explain everything to best of there ability.

good,"While working at Kohl's as part of the management team I acquired many new skills.  I was taught how to manage not only my time but people as well.  I came out of the job with strong skills in building teams and partnerships as well as a proficiency in handling customer service issues.  Kohl's strives to take care of their customers; customers would leave the store happy and ready to return.  Working in a customer service position can be a difficult task.  However, with the training I received through Kohl's I have been prepared to take on any issue with ease."
good,"My Typical day at Kohls is to check out customers and adhere to their concern. I solicit credit cards to every customer no matter how small or free  the order may be. I also need to ask them to solicit their email address. Every customer is handled with the same respect along with our goals which is to Greet, Request for Credit, Ask for E-mail, Ask Customer to perform a survey, and to Thank every customer. If one of these performances were not completed a failure in response is indicated on the survey the customer sends in. So it is imperative to follow direction.  Every order must be checked through and bagged in quick sufficient manner. Along with a cashier  I am also a front end check out coach whom trains cashiers.  I train them to shadow me as I perform my duties. I am responsible for counting down drawers at the end of the evening if I am a closer, and  I over ride any task that a cashier needs to be over ridden in order to take care of the Customer.  I train cashiers to be the best way.  I assist when I can in near by departments that may need assistance but maintain my alertness to the cashier register that I am attending to."

good," I started work at Kohl's as just a Replenishment/merchandising seasonal employee, on the most chaotic day of the year, Black Friday. Little did i know i would end up volunteering to stay all day, all night and into the next day, but i did and it turned out awsome. I got all my breaks when i wanted to take them and since it was understood how long i would be staying i even took a two hour nap in the breakroom. However it wasn't easy. i ran around like a chicken with it's head cut off and ended up working in basically every area of the store. After black friday the days flew by and i kept volunteering to work,work,work which was eagerly appreciated, and i would be asked or begged to work in other departments and just do More,and More. It was awsome i loved working all around the store instead of being one of those people stuck in one department forever. It felt unlike work, like i was just there  doing things i wanted to do staying busy 100% of the time and being paid for it, and the paychecks were every week. later however after the season passed business slowed and i was only given two days a week with minimal hours. My boss wanted to give me hours but just didn't have the work, and wouldn't for some time. He asked and somewhat begged me to take a fulltime position, but it was understood that hours would still be slim pickens.   So i reluctantly accepted my end of assignment and worked the last of my days, to be thrust back into the Shark tank of joblessness. Still, Overall on a scale of awsomeness from 1-100 i would give Kohl's a 97."

The management at Kohl's strive to bring out the best in employees. Our managers believed in strength based management. With over 100 employees on staff you have a nice diverse group of people to work with. Being retail we did have a turnover of staff from time to time. The hardest part of the job would be difficult to put into words. Every job has it's hard parts and I would rather not dwell on that part of employment.
