good,There's a lot of great people that work there and some pretty good supervisors that try to make you the best you can be.
good,Learned my initial job skills from Home Depot and gained experience in providing high level customer service.
good,The only downside to this job was commission only sales and having an ever changing daily work schedule.
good,"Every day how take care customers in any kin situation i learn how treat all people,take care my co-workers and hardest part of the job whent you lead with people don't what let me help they situation and the most enjoyable of my job is lead with different people every day."
good,Its my part time job and its not so bad very flexible. ca n be a very good career if you make it to upper management.
good,My co-workers are great individuals which had great respect for me especially when I was attempting to become a supervisor. I was given the responsibility of being team lead when my supervisor had left for the day. As a team lead I guided my co-workers in the daily situations that would come up and helped with any questions/concerns that they had.
good,"Great place to work for, great opportunity for advancement."
good,You learn a lot about home improvement in a short amount of time which is a lot more useful than what you'd learn at other retail stores. Mainly deal with customers all day and when there is down time you clean the department. The schedule can be a bit rough for some people. Often closing the store at 10pm then working the next day at 6am. It can be exhausting. I feel I can handle pretty much any schedule for any employer with ease now.
good,I enjoyed working for The Home Depot!  Although I was hired as a cashier I quickly worked my way into appliances/flooring/paint/kitchen and bath/ and plumbing very quickly.
good,"Each day I'd assist customer with their needs in ordering products not sold in the store. I learned inventory, stocking & product knowledge for a wide variety of products. The management team was friendly with most of all the associates & my co-workers & I worked together very well."
good,"Typical day is receiving freight with RF gun breaking down pallets and palletizing freight , also using a electric pallet jack or forklift to move merchandise throughout the building ... I learned many skill sets such as learning how to receive and turn multiple trucks with accuracy and speed , loading trucks to maximum cube . learning how to drive multiple pieces of equipment . I also worked close with management resolving problems and doing special projects when asked . The most enjoyable part was my co-workers we worked in teams and developed strong relationships ."
good,Great place to work but advancement can be stagnant at times.
good,"i am a member of management. i like my job, but have a family and will not be able to continue to work every weekend, therefore i am looking to advance myself in a new environment."
good,"During a typical day at work, I'd help at least 20 customers, answer phone calls, and operate a forklift to pack down shelves or load a customer up."
good,"enjoyed working in all operational departments."
good,"A typical day is helping customers locate products and giving them information on how to properly use them. Co workers are great and you can make really close friends. Working here is not hard at all, but you do need to do your job effectively."
good,Everyday you repeat customers and make new customers. You not only learn about the products but how to use them. Management is good but lack training associates in ethics. Hardest part of job is you don't have a life working 72 hours a week.
good,"emocionante dia sobre todo cuando teniamos mucho trabajo "
good,"After working here for awhile, you start seeing the usual customers. During the weekdays afternoons, the job can be quite boring because sales are slow. However, on the weekends the store gets very packed. But, this isn't unusual for many stores. The coworkers are amazing, including managers and supervisors, they are the best part of the job thus far. The hardest part of the job initially was getting accustomed to standing up for hours on end, now it's getting used to the long boring hours if there is too little to do."
good,Working for the Home Depot has been a very good experience for me but information is brought out in rapid fire and if you don't learn quickly you may feel left behind.  Overall everybody works well together and we work together as a team
good,"--on the job training"
good,Helped customers at the register and with questions. Enjoyed customers and coworkers.
good,"A typical day at Home Depot consisted of working in the hardware department, helping costumers, and zone recovery.I learned a lot about tools and how they work. Management at Home Depot was good,and easy to get along with. My co-workers was great to work with, a lot of fun. The hardest part of the job was when a costumer comes in looking for something and we did not have the product in  store. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and helping the costumers."
good,"Enjoyed the friendly atmosphere and support of co-workers including managers. Mr. Curtis, the Store Managers' ""down to earth"" attitude made it very comfortable to express any ideas or concerns. Fair treatment when dealing with associates."
good,"•Assists customers by providing them with product information "
good,Working for the home depot was the highlight of my college years. I loved my coworkers and the regulars I saw day to day. amazing place to make friends
good,"I would either work early mornings from 6 am to 10:30, or late nights from 6pm to 10:30 work duties receiving payments from customers, returns, or applying payments to customer accounts."
good,"Great place with very nice co-workers. I did not know what to expect when I joined.  However, I found a work friendly place with competent managers and motivated workers."
good,"I would follow many policies and procedures. I reviewed many reports daily for focus areas."
good,"providing excellent customer service is number one. fast paced, need to be able to multi-task."
good,"I kept the lot in proper working conditions, spotted forklift operators, responded to customer service calls, loading and unloading vehicles, helped customers at self checkout and filled customer orders from warehouse."
good,"A typical days consists of providing fast, friendly service to our customers and making sure they leave knowing that they have what they need to complete what they're working on. Continuous learning is key role in working at the Home Depot. When I first started working there a little over a year ago I had little knowledge of products and services that we offered. Today, I can work any department in the store and confidently answer customer complaints and problems. Overall, working at the Home Depot has taught me many lessons that will be vital to the success of my career."
good,"I would walk into the Home Depot doors and immediately greet all the home depot associates with a big smile and a hello. I would walk to the back and clock in, out on my apron, and walk onto the sales floor with all smiles. One thing the managers loved about me is the smile I had on my face most the time I was there. I would make sure that the customers had everything they needed to paint their home, stain indoor and outdoor things, sanding, and epoxying their garage floors or driveways. I would mix paint as fast as I could so that they would not be waiting so long and so I could quickly help the next person. I would work on the aisles and make sure they are neat and that we had everything on the shelf. I would fill wing stacks and clip strips. When I was done doing all of this and my shift was not almost over I went to the electrical supervisor and he would have me fix up his aisles and help take care of some customers. When I was at Home Depot I trained for tool rental, cashiering, returns, and paint. Although I trained for all those positions I was only in the paint department. I did go to tool rental when they had a line and needed help creating contracts fast, I would go to the front end supervision and see if they needed help with the cashier lines, and I would bring the line down for returns. So, even though I was officially a paint associate I was 4 in 1. The hardest part of the job was when it was not busy and you have already done what needed to be done in your aisles. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the customers walk out of the Home Depot doors with"
good,"So I started working here when it first opened and it was fun at first but then management started making really strict, ridiculous rules that have had people fired left to right. They say opportunity to get higher in the company but after a while favoritism comes into place and you start seeing people getting higher up due to their close relationship with a supervisor or someone higher up. Good job but dont expect too much from it."
good,"-Would work there again if it came down to it, but not by choice"
good,"being able to work and interact with people"
good,"We work on projects that come from vendors and do general service work in making sure the store and its merchandize is looking correctly.  I've learned much more how the larger corporation  mindset works, much more so than before.  The best part about where I work is the people I work with, we are very much a family.  We look out for each other.  In fact all the employees in the company look out for each other.  We help each other when we are down and out and fall on hard times....and the company helps out as well.  The hardest part might be getting up early and coming in and standing on the hard floor all day.  Other than that....great place to work."
good,Pay was not that great after they added more work to our regular duties without a pay raise. Great work environment learned a lot and gained a lot of experience. If i had to go back and work for this company I would.
good,A typical day for me at The Home Depot would consist of helping out customers and making sure our inventory is fully stocked.
good,"learn to work as a team, back up one another, dont put yourself at risk"
good,Count cash in register log in then made sure workstation was clean and presentable. Stood in front so customers could see me and check out when ready.
good,Get to work set up check what orders needed to be pull or loaded for delivery. I learn about different tools and how they can be used and about how to do it yourself on home improvements. I learned a lot when I was there. Management was good and fair. My co-workers was okay we had a few there that was slackers but we all worked together as a team. The hardest part of the job was we had to pull some orders that had items that was very heavy weigh 100-1000 lbs. The most enjoyable part of the job is going to work everyday and working with my co-workers as a team.
good,"After arriving, the crew will get set tasks for the day, along with an overview of time that projects should be completed in. Manager will then visit from each member to determine if help is needed in setting and evaluate the progress. Co-workers are willing to help one and another along with giving customers the service that is needed or finding them the help that they need."
good,A typical day at work was always great. The environment was good. The customers were always nice and needed nothing but advice or help on buying the correct products. Everyday I learned something new. I learned how to drive the fork lift and stock materials correctly. My co-workers were very nice and helpful when I first started. We were all got along and became a family. The part that I enjoyed the most of my job was always helping the customer and having the customer walk of with a smile on their faces because they were satisfied with my help.
good,"I especially enjoyed my time at The Home Depot. I also worked for one of their competitors, and I would recommend The Home Depot. The support system was unrivaled and the constant training certainly helped with my job. I got along well with my coworkers, and many also deeply enjoyed their jobs too. I worked in the customer service center so it was a bit more stressful than some of the other positions, but I felt the few select individuals who worked this position with me were highly qualified and their support helped me. There was a change in upper management while I was employed here, but the managers under them made sure the store continued to run smoothly and met and exceeded employee concerns and demands. I ultimately left the job because it was a part time position and had no option available for full time employment"
good,A good place to work. overall associates and managers are very friendly and helpful. Interacting with customer is fun. Not many challenging questions after so many years though.
good,"My days at Home Depot consist of excellent customer service. The managers and other employees and great to work with. Even when the day can get extremely busy, we always find a way to make work fun."
good,"Dealing with new/regular customers at a constant pace is very exciting. The job is a great way to learn many skills that could be useful as a homeowner and helpful to advance yourself along your own career path. Management is great and very down to earth. The people you work with come from a wide variety of backgrounds so the cultural aspect can be very helpful as well. The hardest part of the job is juggling tasking and achieving excellent customer service, although if you are diligent it becomes a second nature. My favorite part of the job would be the people both customers and co-workers."
good,I loved when I had the chance to live the values that the company was founded on. The management was willing to give all associates the freedom to take care of the customer.
good,"My day mainly consisted in standing at the self checkout station and assisting customers as needed and also preventing shop lifting whenever possible."
good,"balance vault, print reports, order cash for the next day, administrative duty,"
good,"I loved this company. Mostly, I loved the culture. People at Home Depot always looked for ways to be good to each other. I realize now that the climate has changed. At this point they may be in line with other New York controlled corporations. But, when I worked there, it was a wonderful place."
good,"I have worked with Home Depot for many years as a client.  They were very eager to have me join them as an associate.  My time there has been very informative and educational, however at this time, I am looking to move back into a sales position which may result in me changing companies."
good,The typical day would consist of assisting customers and re-filling stock. I learned a good amount of information on home improvement. The managers there we are friendly and understanding. They also ran things properly and smoothly. The co-workers were some of the best I've ever worked with. The hardest part was occasionally being under staffed. They job over all was enjoyable.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of interacting with all kinds of people; contractors, mothers, elderly etc. As a cashier you learn how to put the customer first always and the importance of great customer service. Many different people came through the store everyday and sometimes you are the first or last person they see. Making good impressions are important. I feel like there is nothing special to say about the management, that being said because it seemed like all the other places I worked. This is not a bad thing most of the management I have been under are great people! The hardest part of my job was down times. Most of the times you would get alot of things done like cleaning the registers and sweeping. There is only so much of that you can do when you cant move away from your cash. Things a little boring without customers! I enjoy getting a chance to interact with all kinds of people, helping solving their problems gives you a great feeling of accomplishment!"
good,"Home depot provided me with additional knowledge in my field of study while providing a means to support my financials."
good,"This was a productive and fun environment. Management is excellent, co-workers were great."
good,"a typical day at work just customer service all the way. helping customers find what there looking for. explaing a product. what i learned my department was kitchen and bath so i learned the different companies who make toliets,tub,cabinets etc. I also learned different departments. My co-workers were helpful and very smart the hardest part of the job when it was a certain item the costumer needed and really didn't know to much about that particular department they would get a little frustrated. but i would guide them with the co-worker who could help. the most enjoyable part of the job helping others."
good,"Great place, great experience. The people were the best. The job was challenging, rewarding and there was always opportunity to learn more."
good,"I started off as a cashier, and I was eventually promoted to work at the special services desk. I would clock in, and go out to the front desk where I first checked the order management. I had to see what customers needed to be called & call them regarding their special orders arriving and ready for pick up, changes in eta's, who still has payments owed on orders, etc. While doing that, the phone would ring on the overhead for me and my fellow special service co-worker to answer. We had to answer any questions they had, or locate the correct department for them to be transferred to. While doing these tasks, customers would come up to the desk to pay for or return items. Customers would also come to us to pick up their special orders, or to place items on will-call to pick up at a later day or time. I also had to special order items for customers either online, or through our special order books that we had designated for each department. If we didn't have anything available online or through our books, I had to call the vendor and create a special order for the customer through them. These sales were tracked every week. I also was in charge of the online orders. We had a first phone at the service desk at all times that would go off throughout the day saying that we had a new order. We had a ""Buy Online Pick up in Store System"", that customers used daily. Our task was to pull up the order through our system, and go pull it for the customer off the sales floor. It then had to be located in the system and tagged in the store ready for them to pick up, all within thirty minutes."
good,"There is a need to be flexible,co-workers were very nice for the most part and job was relatively easy."
good,The management team at my store is wonderful they are extremely supportive to their associates and supervisors
good,"Worked in home improvement. Learned about plumbing, appliances, and electricity. Management was acceptable. Co-workers were very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was the lack or training. The most enjoyable was my co-workers and the public."

good,I love my job and the company but they seem to be changing into a direction I do not like and I am just ready for a change away from retail.
good,it is an overall solid company to work for providing good benefits and compensation.
good,I enjoy helping out the customers and working with my co-workers. the managers all gets down and get their hands dirty I like that.
good,There is a great overall compenation package. Along with this there is plenty of room for advancement. It is a fantastic company to work for. The major downfall is the lack of work/life balance. It is retail so the hours are long and irregular.
good,"Fun place to work, but a bit mismanaged in certain locations."
good,The typical day included contact with customers that required knowledge of products and location of products.  It was very gratifying to not only listen to their projects but make suggestions on and help them complete the purchase of everything they would need to complete their project.
good,I enjoyed the work atmosphere at Home Depot and the people I worked with. They were very customer oriented.
good,As a manager your work/life balance can be difficult. It will require more than the 50 hour week.
good,I learned to multi-task and never had to be micro-managed. The hardest part about working there was when we had to train people from India to take over our job. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting our customers and getting to know them. I loved working there and wish I could return.
good,"Home Depot is a pretty good place to work, for a retailer. The co-workers and management, for the most part, are amazing. There is a great culture of taking care of each other and taking care of the community which is just outstanding."
good,"My job at Home Depot was new experience for me, but interesting,,I help people to find what they need and with the language, I translate Spanish to English, I like my job.."

good,"It has been nice to work with terrific, hard-working people who believe in doing the right thing.  People work hard here.  Contractors are not given the opportunity to work from home in most cases and with a long commute it can be a bit of a drag."
good,"typically each store is like a tight knit Family. As a company there was great pay and benefits. The only down fall was upper management forgot we all had families of our own, and requested more and more from associates."
good,"I enjoyed working at home depot. I was responsible with managing the cashiers such as their break times, getting change when needed, and helping out whenever needed. The hardest part at this job was trying to calm down an irrate customer. The management was not as interactive with the employees as they should have been."
good,The Home depot was fun place to work because the staff and management team were excellent together.
good,"Worked in several depts. over several years. I learned about management and how big box companies work. Eager to learn all aspects of business and was entrusted to do so and encouraged. Despite these factors, was never granted full time hours or benefits."
good,"Assist customers. Service Bays. "
good,"I worked overnight and got used to it really fast, not a lot of customers at night so it leaves you time to work."
good,"Working in retail has its similarities in any company, but this one is well geared and takes care of its employees."
good,"Assist customers with products that they need. Also mentored other associates in product knowledge & customer service. "
good,"As a dedicated employee, I assisted customers by inquiring about their needs for different products. I was resourceful in obtaining their solutions.  I would communicate with my coworkers with arranging lunch schedules so at least somebody would watch over the department in case a customer had a question.  The hardest part of the job was the unpredictable highs and lows of traffic patterns.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to hear good responses regarding an install job."
good,"I believe management tasks became more important than customer service.  Daily responsibilities were many.  Often times so much as to detract from time that should have been spent with customers.  Some of the co-workers did little, causing the ones who were conscientious to have to do more.  It was difficult at times to get employees to do their jobs thoroughly and with care.  Satisfied customers were the most enjoyable part.  Knowing you gave that needed helping hand to someone always made me feel that I really did my job well."
good,"I got this job as a garden associate on the weekends while working during the week and taking college classes. I enjoyed working with the people there but had to quit because my plate just became to full. I wish I would have been able to work at Home Depot at a different time in my life. Regardless, it was a great experience."
good,"Trained cashiers, great mix of personalities.  Co-workers always friendly and willing to help each other."
good,general store work helping customers maintaining lumber area
good,"As far as retail is concerned, it's awesome. Even the cashiers are happy."
good,Is challenging company there's every thing you spec and more. Now that I work for home depot is very different then shopping. Is a slow paste where you get to see every item in the store closely and more effective.
good,typical day come in count your register make sure your area is clean and start to assist customer
good,"A place where you receive hands on experience in managing a multi-million dollar business with exposure to various facets and aspects of business (business strategy, metrics, operations, merchandising, HR, etc)."
good,"Home depot is a great place to work, my job was to set up products for vendors. Some jobs would take 5 min. other jobs would take up to 50 hours or more. Still working on a staff that could complete a job in a timely manner. When a job is completed, it's a great feeling because you had a big part of it. The hardest part of the job now is that we don't get to spend to much time in one department to really get everything done, we work every department but we can only spend so much time in it."
good,It was a good job when i work there good pay and great people working with me. The management was good. Good people. I didn't really have any difficulties when working at Home Depot. I liked my job when i was working there. It was seasonal but i loved my job.
good,"Corporate downward message has a strong values component."
good,"Home Depot is second best job I've had, I learned how to work fast pace and interact with upset customer, the management was great everyone was friendly and amazing people they were always smiling. The co- workers were great to work with and we always had fun never a dull moment. The hardest part of the job would have had to be that the store was so big it took a while to learn where everything was. the most enjoyable part was meeting new people and having that interaction."
good,"Home depot is a good place to work, but some of the employees they hire are not the right choice. I have learned more about home improvement with in the various sections of the store. The management could be a little better and follow peoples restrictions pertaining to someones schedule. The hardest part of the job is to try and get along with coworkers that do not know what they are doing. The most enjoyable part of the job is being scheduled with coworkers that you get along with and makes the day go quicker and more enjoyable."
good,"The Home Depot is a great company to work for that for the most part really strives to take care of their employees.  The company provides some great benefits to their employees and try to give individuals an opportunity to advance within the company.  "
good,"good place to work at, not really any complaints about the store. every one has their duties and know what to do. everyone is very helpful. hardest part of the job is defiantly helping out angry customers they don't seem to be to understanding when a mistake is made. most enjoyable part though is the satisfaction in helping them out, knowing you solved a problem for them."
good,"It is enjoyable to be a cashier at the Home Depot, I love my co-workers and being in direct contact with the customers."
good,"To inform customers on different products, reviewing quotes, and keeping a stocked and clean workplace."
good,"I would order product for the Hardware department and keep it stocked. I would also do the monthly, quarterly, and yearly department reports.."
good,I came across alot of great people and management that really cared about their job and taking care of customers.  The bonus compensation for hourly associates was a great incentive.  Management needs to pay more attention to the operation side of the business to better service the customers.  I spent almost 24 years with Home Depot and enjoyed all of it.
good,Worked there for awhile up until i changed jobs. ok benefits
good,"very busy and a lot of multi tasking, high volume and working with contractors and doing special orders of thousands of dollars, and scheduling up to 100 deliveries a day"
good,The Home Depot is a great place to work.  I have been there for just a short while but so far so good.
good,"A typical day at work was getting things together to start your day. Making sure you had everything you needed in order to make it comfortable for you. Since I was a cashier, you had to deal with many different personalities with customer as well as co- workers. Certain parts of management was easier to work with than others but that is everywhere. You have to adept. The hardest part of the job and enjoyable part is the same, the different personalities."
good,"Cashiering was fun, learned few merchandising tips from whoever was working in the adjacent departments from the main aisle separating from registers."
good,Flooring and appliance retail sales. Customer service. Learned DYI from the source of many wonderful associates and customers. Learned to be a leader. Was able to use my creative side to help homeowner design the space they always wanted with DYI techniques or Home Depot installs.
good,"People at Home Depot are very friendly. Most of the associates are great people to work with. Some, however are very unpleasant. The management has gone downhill. Multiple managers are very disrespectful and rude. They act like Home Depot is the only store people can shop at when they know they can lose customers to other competitors. I'm ashamed to have ever worked for the company. I would definitely not recommend working for them."
good,"Very fast paced environment, focused on 100% customer satisfaction. Friendly atmosphere among co workers. Constantly monitoring customer service and associate interaction with the customers in order to maintain the highest level of service as well as a safe work and shopping environment. Answering internal and external calls, solving problems for both customers and associates. Executing merchandising, safety and environmental required daily tasks, reviewing and analyzing reports, communicating, coaching and training associates. Hiring new associates and addressing any performance, safety or security issues. The hardest part of the job is the extreme long hours ( 12 hour shifts scheduled). The most enjoyable is interacting and meeting lots of people, accomplishing goals, solving problems and making customers and associates happy."
good,Its a retail job.  If you are a college student they will give you hours when you are back in town.  The pay is not the greatest but what can expect from retail.
good,"Typical work day started at 5:00 am  with a team stretch and flex, then to shelf maintenance refreshing, restocking, and retagging shelves, until 7:15am for our morning meeting, which involved safety topics, how many bays per hour our district have completed for the week, and other important news that relates to us."
good,Working for the Home Depot for the last 7.5 years was an enjoyable experience for the most part. I was able to learn a lot and was given the opportunity to advance a number of times. I got a long with many of my co-workers as well as members of management.
good,"As as Asst Store Manager, my typical day would be 11 hours, a ridiculous shift. Most of my role involves leadership and delegation. The company has great values and philosophies on leadership. They're just not always practiced at the store level."
good,The day starts very early.  But I work with a great team and our hard work pays off with compensation and career advancement.  I enjoy growing and developing my team and watching them advance.  I enjoy helping customers realize their home improvement dreams whether they be big or small.  The hardest part of my job is watching someone with talent not apply it.  Mediocrity is unacceptable.
good,"Fun place to work, good training. Stickler on hours though."
good,good place  just not enough hours how to deal with a huge amount of people who may or may not know what they needed.
good,Loved for my team to come together in one department and work as a team to get the job done.
good,"stocking  filling hardware department, i have learned to work at fast and safe . Management has very good training videos to view. My co workers always work together as a team.The most dificult part about my job is the minimal amount of time that is allowed to perform my duty. I have always enjoyed working with the public."
good,"Overview weekly sales and see where improvement could be made. "
good,Lots of skill sets blended under one roof. Great hours and the ability to learn new skill sets. Great co-workers and good management. time management can be the hardest part when making sure all tasks are done in one shift. But the different skill sets you can learn from is a great tool to have.
good,Enjoyed the constant change in work flow making you push your self to become a better well rounded manager.
good,I learned different products that were in store and how to help a customer shop online and how to up sale items that where in the store and those that belong to the vendors
good,"This job entailed setting up and routing floor measurement jobs in the Staten Island and New Jersey areas.  On a daily basis, the position required extensive use of computer skills during that process.  In addition, went to the job sites and recorded flooring measurements which were electronically sent to home site at the end of each work day."
good,"J'ai eu toujours de tres bonne journee de travail parce que dans une journee c'est moi qui fait de la journee ce que je veuxd'elle pour rejoindre les opportunites de developpement,  naturellement avec vos collegues de travail plus precisement avec les clients. En ce qui concerne le poste de travail ca arrive parfois que le poste est difficile mais ca n'empeche pas que je fais mon travail meme si ces difficiles avec les clients ou mes collaborateurs de travail."
good,"Enjoyed my time spent with Home Depot over seven years, first as a vendor, then as a MET associate/supervisor. I did not want to go the way I did. Wish things could have worked out differently."
good,"Customers are always first. It is my job to attend to their every need, and provide answers to their questions. I handle customer accounts and manage purchase orders. Set up installs."
good,The Home Depot is a wonderful company to work for and stands out in the retail industry by placing emphasis on customer satisfaction.
good,"Home depot is a great place to work. They work with your schedules when you need it and will treat you like family and will help you when you need it. A very respectful and well kept work environment. Employees always have a smile on their faces and will take time to help customers no matter how busy they are. Management is great and will offer help whenever needed and will show respect to everyone that walks in or out of the store. Co-workers are very kind and helpful and there is never a hostile moment inside or out. I have learned numerous things from Home Depot such as, what tools do what and what kind of wood you would need for a certain job along with electrical issues."
good,"Very busy, I learn a lot about the store and different departments, like plants, wood, kitchen sinks, stove and etc. Management was good in some areas. My co-workers loved working with them. Hardest part of the job was learning everything about the different items. Saturday's when we have work \shop for the kids."
good,"Good Knowledge gain on windows 8 apps"
good,I like the job but I didn't find any job placement at the call center location I was working at.
good,"Working at The Home Depot was an interesting experience for me as it held a lot of mixed emotions for me. I worked in the Garden Department of The Home Depot, which is a rather rigorous department to work in. My fellow co-workers and associates were a pleasure to work with and even my supervisors were great and helped to create a comfortable environment. Management, however, was often difficult to get along with for me as they didn't come off too friendly for me a lot of the time. I realize that they have a job to do themselves, but they could have been more friendly and helpful about it all. While I had a minor issues with the manager and assistant managers' attitudes towards my fellow associates and I, they definitely did work hard and do their job well. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the interaction and open friendliness between the other associates and cashiers. I felt like I could be myself and enjoy the companionship of others while I was working. Everyone respected each other, for the most part, and we either got along well or left each other to our own devices."
good,"•	Responsible for the budgeting, capacity planning and forecasting for the associate segmentation in call center and store"

good,"	Perform Cashier/ Customer service "
good,The company has great things to offer the employee but the management at my store went south and had a firing spree after the home market collapsed.
good,"depending on the store you work in this job can be amazing or not so much. moving up with the company is possible if your brave enough to step up to the boss and let them know who you are, other wise since it's such a big store in a very big company you can get forgotten easily.    i personally love working with this company."
good,I enjoyed the HD culture and helping people.  Enjoyed presenting the merchandise to customers and problem solving.

good,i loved going to work everyday because i like to be around my co-workers nd customer.
good,"Home Depot is really a nice place to work as far as retail goes. My coworkers are friendly and my superiors are all about employee advancement. That being said, you have to become an Assistant Manager to make $30k-$40k salary and that's with 60 hour work weeks."
good,"I enjoy working at Home Depot. They have lots of fun programs, prize give aways to help keep you motivated."
good,I have learned how to run cash registers. Answer phone calls. Follow orders and much more. I find my boss does a good job of making things fun for all employees. The most rewarding part of the job is when you satisfy a customers needs.
good,"Home Depot is a solid company to work for and job security is good despite a poor economy. It is retail and the demands of customers can be overwhelming at times when it gets busy. The company does value the associates but upper level management forgets what its really like on the front lines as an associate. If Home Depot keeps their processes simple, then it would benefit the hourly associates who do not have time to chase metrics."
good,"As a cashier would be able to get in and work right away.  Learned to check out customers fast and accurate, with good management and co-workers.  No real hard part to the job and the most enjoyable thing was the support from management and working hours"

good,"I enjoy helping people,I like to stay busy, my co-workers were very helpful,"
good,Good company to learn retail values. and learn customer service skills.
good,"It's your typical place to work out.  Has its ups and downs, pros and cons.  Although there is rarely any sort of coverage since they are always cutting hours.  Best part of the job would be majority of the coworkers.  They're nice for the most part.  Some of my least management that I've had to work with, extremely difficult to ever get a hold of one."
good,"Department Supervisor of Lumber/Building materials and a typical day is to oversee department to ensure that product is full, in stock and give the best customer service possible."
good,Home Depot is a good place to work for. They are very considerate for your personal life. My job is now mostly enjoyable but can be stressful and frustrating. I have been in school since I started with Home Depot and since day 1 they have been understanding and worked with my schedule with is important. The management is pretty good at the store Im with although they can be on different pages sometimes. the most enjoyable part would have to be when everyone shows up and is where they are supposed to be which makes enough coverage. although is doesn't happen all the time it is nice when it does.

good,"On a typical day at work I spend most of my time at the entrance greeting and directing customers to what they are looking for. I've been working at this store for 2 years so I have learned the layout of our store and picked up on some hardware,plumbing, etc knowledge that I utilize to help customers. More than one manager is always present at the store so employees can always refer to them if we need assistance. My co-workers are friendly and helpful people to work with. The hardest part of this job is when we have difficult customers such as contractors who easily become upset when we do not carry certain products due to our small sized location. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work in a fun environment with people that are always willing to help you."
good,Typical day at work are mostly busy with customers and you learn something new
good,"Home Depot is good as a summer job when there is a lot of  foot traffic, but once August hits their slow season begins."

It is a pleasure to know my customers come back time and time again knowing that they receive first class service at our store. I also take care of fellow employees. Making sure they have everything they need to successfully take care of our customers. The hardest part of the job is having a customer dissatisfied with our performance. That also ties in with the greatest part as well, solving their concern thoroughly, with a smile, and sincerity."
good,coworkers help me to become one of the best sale person i am today with great skills
good,"My current typical day at Home Depot would include receiving greetings from fellow employees as I walk in. I punch in, grab a First Phone and start working freight. I have learned how to read store performance stats, the importance of knowing the 3 major causes of shrink (mdse leaving, mdse coming in, and price changes), and the importance of the customer. My co-workers are friendly and work hard. The hardest part of my current position is realizing that I miss being an Inventory Management Associate and that the position is now given to the MET team. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I can look around and see that I made an impact on the store's success."
good,"Progressive - slowly but surely the Home Depot moves toward it's many goals, from providing unparalleled customer service with product knowledge, to a great work environment for new and old employees."

good,Good opportunity for advancement. Great benefits and employee compensation. 
good,Currently working here and enjoy everything about it except the advancement options. 
good,"I sold windows and doors, special ordering custom windows and doors.  Talked to many Vendors for special orders and learned a lot about the products I was selling, which help make me a better salesperson.  Hardest part was when I couldn't get what the customer wanted."
good,Good company and a great place to work. typical day at work starts at 3pm to 11. patrol the building and keep the crowds under control.
good,My day at Depot is managing money and perparing tills before the cashier come in for work the hardest thing at depot to do is making sure I don't mix the money. My co-workers are nice and friendly but the customer are really nice but we do get some customer that are not so nice but you have to know how to keep your cool and be professional.

good,"To me the most enjoyable part of the job was, matching a messed bay with POG. Sometime it's challenging, but I love that challenge. Depends upon the product's of the bay that you are working with, it can be hardest part also.  Personally, most of the time, I think it's you, who make the attitude on your co-workers. I always enjoyed my teams in different group. I loved my management, they recognized the people and gave them the motivation. [it's totally depends under which management you are working with.]. Everyday, there was something new to learn. Learned more about best customer service, merging in a team and work as one [when doing big resets]. Handle challenges alone [ when reset bays or building small resets]. Keep a keen attention to the details and there is always something to do. A typical day start with a short meeting, then going through the assigned areas."
good,"It is a pleasant place to work, with the emphesis on serving the customer.  The managment, and co-workers are easy to work for, and with. My positon is part-time with no benefits."
good,"Working for The Home Depot was a great experience for me, I met some of the most wonderful people, co-workers and customers."
good,"Home Depot is a progressionist company. They hold seminars free for the public on home improvement, were recognized as the most ""green"" retailer in America, holds good reputation as a good credit card company and has every customer satisfaction policy imaginable (free shipping, home delivery, price match/beat, near argueless return policy, etc). As an employer, they have the Homer Fund, for employees suffering serious catastrophies. They also have an vested interest in your ability to progress in the company, as it is not rare to be moved to multiple positions to polish your resume for assistant management positions, if you have the seniority and desire. They prioritize military LEGITIMATELY, not just saying it to say it. They don't do associate discounts, however they are ""in-network"" with many major service providers, my favorite was (cell phone company-no names allowed). The discount I received actually vastly outdid my military discount. This exists in a LARGE number of companies you use. HOWEVER, they are retail. Expect long hours, constant management contradiction, low pay for qualifications (seniority makes a huge difference), and several typical dodgy practices of large companies to save a quick buck,i.e. 80% part time only to not pay for benefits, time-in-position ""raises"" of $.10-$.25/hour a year, and vacation time is minimal at best, and may not be taken 6 months out of the year, etc."
good,"meeting all different kinds of people, laborers, homeowners, everyone with one thing in mind; getting the job done"
good,"My day started by finding which department I was going to work in, since it could of been anything from throwing items on the line, using a electric pallet jack to move items around the warehouse, or just unloading a truck and scanning items into the system."
good,The Home Depot is a great work environment. Ive learned to have great customer service and to always put customers first. The company has great values and is striving to be better. My co-workers are very helpful and we know how to work as a team. The hardest part of the job I would say is getting full time when part time. The most enjoyable part has to be helping people fix their household problems.
good,"  Before star working, we are had meting they give to us information about how much work they have,loadling,full pallet pickers etc."
good,Everyday is a new adventure and you love to go to work.  I was taught how to manage different types of employees. I learned how to merchandise product as well. You work with great people.  The job is really easy and I love helping people.
good,The company gives some opportunities to expand on jobs and move people into different departments.  The management also cares about their employees and makes sure that they are taken care of.
good,"A typical day at work would involve me working with my associates to provide the best possible customer service to the many customers that walk through our doors.  I would answer any questions the customer had and always provided the best possible solution that would fit in their budget.  Management is very kind, friendly, and understanding.  If I have any problem whatsoever, the managers are more than happy to help me or any of the other employees.  The hardest part of the job is sometimes I am left alone and I am the only one in the entire paint department and store that can help customers with their paint needs.  Many times when I am alone many customers will come at once and some of them get upset when I tell them that no one else is in the store can help except for me.  Luckily for me, the majority of the customers are understanding of my situation.  The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the associates and some of the customers.  One can learn a lot of different things and it can really help develop a network."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Home Depot.  It was a friendly environment and all of my former co-workers were very supportive of one another."
good,"A typical work day consists of engaging customers and aiding them in solving an issue, starting or finishing a project. As a sales associate at Home Depot I learned how to use many hand tools, how to drive fork lifts, electric ladders and many other useful  hardware. The most difficult part of the job is getting adjusted to a changing work schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to use the hand tools, forklifts and other hardware."
good,coworkers are very good people.i deal with all types of different people different problems that may come up.
good,"Having worked both as a manager and an associate, each by choice,  I have a good perspective of day-to-day activities. Most associates are responsible for daily cleanup, stocking, and shelving of products and ultimately customer service. Specialty departments have customers to follow up with both on quotes and orders, as well as vendors and installers. "
good,"I get my apron, punch in, go to the manager on duty or my supervisor and ask which department has the most freight because I like a challenge. "
good,The company is great to work for always trys to put the associates first and reward them for job well done.  
good,"I loved my co-workers, it is a great job to learn about business', but of course very seasonal, not many full time positions offered."
good,As a cashier I enjoyed helping and interacting with customers each day. This enabled me to develop excellent communication and interpersonal skills. I also enjoyed working in a busy environment. And I also learned to work as part of a team with co-workers and management. 
good,"The best part of my job is the awesome people I work with. Management is hit or miss with being good or bad. Right now my management is hard to work for because they forget that they need to take care of our people, which is part of the core values of the company. Overall it is a pretty good job, other than unless you are lucky enough to get into an operations position, you have to work every weekend."
good,Typically customer service is the most vital aspect of the job. I learned how to better communicate with customers. Management was very helpful and represented a team outlook at work. Co-workers were very nice and made going to work that much more enjoyable. Hardest part was getting to know how the computer systems work within the company. The people I worked with were the best part of the job. 
good,A typical day at work would be taking complaints from customers and giving them solutions it also incuded doing cashier work and exchanges as well as putting in special orders for customers. The counter was run by 2 of us on a week day and up to 5 on weekends. Teamwork was a must and we all got along great. Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who could get aggressive when the solutions presented didnt please them or when our vendors didnt meet the high expectations of the client. Loved the fact that as a part time employee i had benefits and that my direct manager was great! General management also treated us with BBQ's and goodies on the holidays we had to work. Overall a great job experience. learned how to deal with very difficult people while keeping a level head.
good,Great benefits and advancement opportunity.  Good leadership. Minimum hours for management is 5 11 hour days.
good,great place to work like a new job every day have to like to work with people
good,good place to work. great people. enjoyed working here and would defiently recommend this company to toher people looking for a decent job but not to support a family
good,"A typical day starts out by catching up with the other head cashier regarding who's doing what and when. Next I would organize breaks, lunches and paper work, prioritize projects and then do a cashier check-in. Upon talking shortly with each cashier, I would delegate projects to cashiers and being working on my daily projects while ensuring the cashiers and customers needs are met. The best part of my job is supporting and coaching the cashiers. I love being able to encourage skill development, goals setting and supporting career directions the cashiers are working toward. The hardest part of my day is if customers get upset at the cashiers for issues that the cashier has no control over such as a credit card being declined. When situations such as these arise, it is my job to solve the situation in a manner that supports the cashier, satisfies the customer and upholds company policy. If you take care of the customers and the other associates and show initiative, have a strong work ethic and have pride in place of employment you can advance easily. The Home Depot is a good place to work if you are self motivated and want career advancement in a do it yourself corporation."
good,"The Home Depot has 3 core vales in Customer Service, In-Stock and Store Appearance. At my first store it was a very close-knit group of people. I truly enjoyed going to work every day. At my next store, it was more of a numbers or bust environment. Overall, the vision of the company is great, the people are mostly pleasurable to work with, and the feeling you get from going above and beyond a customer's expectations is what makes the job worth having."
good,I pack out freight that came straight from the truck. This job was a back breaker
good,"I like this job, I wanted to stay at this job for along time. I liked being able to take care of customers needs. I had a lot of family problems at the time to where it reflected my job."
good,"The benefits and work environment at Home Depot is a reflection of their culture and corporate values. Each hour spent should be a productive one, which they support by providing you with all the tools, direction and encouragement you will need to be successful."
good,"The company is a very political organization, but also very segmented by department - i.e. an employee's happiness and potential for advancement highly depends on the department in which he or she works. The pay and benefits are great, and working in the corporate office provides a feeling of camaraderie, due to the town hall meetings, which often feel like big pep rallies. I really liked the overall feeling that the corporate office works FOR the associates in the store, as those associates do work directly with the most important success factor in a retail organization - the customers."
good,"a typical day at work includes helping customers & stocking,"
good,"A typical day is rather slow. The hardest part of my job is the downtime. I like to stay busy throughout the day. I love the people I meet, my co-workers, and how we all mesh as a unit."
good,I have worked at Home Depot on two different occasions and look forward to working at the Depot again.
good,"Home Depot is a great company. All the co-workers are fun and knowledgable of product. I enjoy every part of this company. I just need full time work, and they have tried to work with me, home depot is not able to give anymore fulltime positions at this time. I have a very challenging position, and love the stress of sales, I know they hate to see me go."
good,"I would work in the garden department, selling outdoor power equipment and provide customer service and product knowledge. I learned a lot from working here. I learned more about tools, gardening, and providing customer service."
good,Good place to work. Great benefits Friendly people. A chance to grow. Learn something useful that you can use away from the work place.

good,"Good people to work with ,helpfull management people with good benefits."
good,"Home Depot was a great experience. I learned alot from working here. Was offered to become head cashier within a couple of weeks of working there. Had to deny it, because of the hours at the time. I was not able to accept it."
good,"Learned a lot of architect work and learned a lot about different color selections. Moreover, interior and exterior painting and staining."
good,Fellow employees were great. Good clean working store.
good,"A typical day at work is going in to make sure all the customers tool are in the reasiving area. I have to verify then call customer to pick up theire fix tools. Every day i learn something new because i learn from the customers and from the profetionals. In my department I have to make sure that all the associate stay in there area because we get alot of work and alot of traffic from customers. I like spending time with my co-workers when ever we have a chance because it is fun for us to hang out, out from work so we can get to know each other a little better than just work. Thr hardest part of my job is to call every customer that i need to call because is time consuming. I have to call the customers for the tool that they will need to pick up or if the would like for me to repair there tool. Everything i do at work i enjoy it because i love what i do. But I know i need something new in my life so i have to move on."
good,"Lots of opportunity for advancement, not easy, however to move up to managerial positions, but a good challenge."

good,"HD is a company where an associate can work to his/her fullest, learn about many house issues and solutions, and enjoy performing."
good,My workday begins at 5 o'clock in the morning. I am one of the first people to be there. My first job is to send money to the front cash registers before the store opens at 6 a.m. I have learned new skills in the reconciling of the cash registers and using various machines in the vault. My co-workers are very respectful and pleasant to work with.
good,The work was not to hard. A lot of standing in one place. The co-workers were extremely pleasant to work with. The management was also very helpful and kind to employees. The hardest part was standing on a concrete floor all day.
good,"A typical day involves extensive customer service and hard labor. Wen not finding every customer I can to greet and assist, I'm working on organizing pallets of tile and hardwood flooring. Occasionally a graphic project comes my way where I can use my art background to make something for the store. Co-workers are very knowledgeable and available for aid when needed."
good,"Home Depot has a wonderful training program, I learned how to lay all kinds of flooring"
good,"Most of the associates and leaders at The Home Depot truly do work using the company values. It is retail and lots of hard work. As a leader, especially during the busy spring season, it is hard to have a good work-life balance. 60+ hours a week is the norm."
good,"This was my best job. I learned alot, my had wonderful employees, and we had a bond. The managers were ok, but their was some lazy people that worked their at times though, and the hardest part of the job was the whether in some cases cause the winter time is hectic here."
good,"A typical day started with a team meeting, followed by area designations. Breakdown of pallets, stocking product."

good,good benefits
good,"On a typical day, there was always something new to learn if you are trying to advance. Co-workers as well as management are always available to ask questions or bring up any concerns. Sometimes the hardest thing about the job was when it would be extremely busy and it would be hard to try to accommodate a customer but part of what made it better was the ability to overcome the hectic day and help the customer. I really enjoyed working with customers and being able to help them and have them walk out of the store happy for their purchase and treatment they received while being there."
good,working there was a good experience and taught me a bunch of Handy Man skills.
good,At home Depot you are working at a fsted pace with many tasks thjat need to be completed. it is a very fun and exciting place to work if you like fast paced.
good,What I learned from Home Depot is to take pride in your work and go above and beyond in reaching the goal of providing excellent customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job is customer satisfaction because it means that I am doing my job correctly and to the best of my ability.
good,friendly people
good,It was a good place to interact with a variety of people. Learned how to run a cash register pretty well.

I learned customer satisfaction and how to work fast. Management is really good they respect you and treat you equal with others to. Hardest part of the job was lifting concert bags a lot but i was worth the work out. The most enjoyable part of that job was talking to customers and asking them about there projects and how they're day was going.
good,"Awesome Company. There is much to learn from the business structure and company operation to the managers and each individual employee. The knowledge and experience from home depot was great for a new homeowner like me learning a little bit about everything in each department. Management varied like people do. You have the great ones that are down to earth and the ones that think they are actually above you as a person.. The hardest part on my job was dealing with horrible customers. Sometimes the customer take out a lot of their frustration on the associates, that's why many associates quit or switch positions. the most enjoyable part about the job has to be the people that you meet everyday. You get to learn and interact with many different types of people doing all types of projects, jobs and hobbies."
good,"A typical day started with a morning meet informing of sales, new products, training that was available, inventory control, words of encouragement for the today and sometime breakfast. I learned from the management and my co-workers, how to be detail-oriented."

good,Its a good job. They do alot of charity for work for the local neighborhoods and have awesome christmas parties.
good,"Fast paced and room for advancement. Flexible schedules, and friendly co- workers."
good,"It was a good company to work for. The staff acts more like a family, watching out for each other. Some of the new policies passed down by corporate can be a little tough to stomach from time to time but you power through it. Customer is ALWAYS right was the most difficult to deal with. Big plus would be the benefits offered to even part time associates. In the winter I saw a drastic drop in hours because of lower customer numbers, that was the most difficult part of the job. Overall I would recommend the job to someone else."
good,"The people i worked with were great. it was like one big happy family. Co-workers actually cared about each other and helped each other out instead of throwing people under the bus. On the other hand management can be a pain. The communication between the store manager and assistant managers was terrible, and even worse when something needed to be relayed to the department supervisors."
good,"Worked overnight shift. Learned alot, managemet was good."
good,good company understanding management always communicate with team member s

I love to help customers discover new ideas about planting and giving them the knowledge that I have. I have many repeat costomers that come in every weekend to visit me and ask for help. I enjoy being outside and this is a great place for me."

good,It is a very busy place and they give many opportunities to learn new things.
good,I enjoy working at Home Depot because the managers (at least my managers) do not micromanage their employees. As long as you are doing what they ask and what your job description entails you will be successful.

At closing time unload trucks that comes in and drop pallets of merchadise down from over head to stock.Sweep all isles down stock new merchandise. I learned to drive 3 type of fork lifts in the store and load pallets of customers trucks. Work hard in a timely matter. The manager are fair and will work you hard. The hardest part of the job was the crazy shifts schedule. The most enjoyable about the job was working very hard and working very fast the fast pace and stress was fun.
good,"A typical day at work is face-paced. Each day a new goal to finish a certain amount of work is set. Doing work from pack-down to freight and any other project store manager assigns. Learning at The Home Depot is an ongoing procedure due to how many products are sold and the differences in costumer home projects. The biggest thing learned from The Home Depot would have to be being able to assist costumers and stick to the goals assigned. Management are very involved in our daily activity. Co-Workers are for the most part happy to be at work everyday. Very few times problems will arrive. The hardest part about my job is waking up for the third shift position I have. The most enjoyable part would have to be the faced pase, physical work that is required."
good,"As each store will differ depending on the manager, for the most part the culture of Home Depot is the same no matter where. The employees truly care about each other and the city around them. My store does a lot of events with local charities and the whole of Home Depot is especially dedicated to Vets."

I worked hours that were helpful adn they worked with them wonderfully, I worked with nice and caring people that helped our customers and employees as needed. I loved that store but i was there every weekend and couldn't enjoy my weekends off and my family,"
good,Very fast pace company. Main focus is customer service. Management is very involved with employees needs. Co-workers really help each other out. The hardest part was not enough training to learn new department. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing returning customers feeling happy on shopping.
good,"I had a good time working in the receiving department there. I enjoyed keeping things organized and the degree of responsibility involved with the position. I liked the fact that, for the most part, I always stayed busy while working at Home Depot."
good,"It was a great learning experience, not only in home improvement, but also my management skills."
good,This Home Depot works very understaffed. Most employees do the very best they can.

good,"benefits were good,,hrs were very good after a year of service they gave you vacation time and sick time if you needed it,,they treated everyone there fairly not harrassment or violence was tolerated"
good,"A typical work day in the paint department is very fast pace, you learn how to multitask, listen, give short advice, assist customers with major projects. Management can be a bit annoying when making assumptions within a situation that they know nothing about. Co-workers are very easy to work and get along with, they're helpful and assertive. The hardest part of the job is working four to five hours by yourself because management cut hours. Nevertheless, by talking with the customers while working, helping them with complex decisions in reference to their paint project and watching them leave a happy customer, is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Great work environment, great co-workers and management team, work well with everybody."
good,"I worked as an Administrative Assistant to a Director of Human Resources for our Merchandising Department. It was a very basic administrative job that included a lot of calendar managment, meeting planning, and answering questions regarding payroll. My co-workers were friendly and eager to assist if I had questions. The hardest part of the job was the file room project I started from the ground up. The most enjoyable part was the completion of the file room."

I started of as a cashier, then advanced to the special service desk, and then due to childcare issues I was able to be place on the overnight Freight Team. Everyone I work with was great. I did everything from customer contacts, special orders, returns, cashiering, truck and equipment rentals, overnight stocking of all departments, palletizing overstock to be placed in the overhead, O.P. certified. There was always room to grow"
good,the hardest part of this job is keeping up with customers in busy seasons
good,The Home Depot was the first place to offer me employment so i will be forever thankful to them. I have to admit i am currently in search of a new career because the company seems to have fallen into hands of the wrong people. They are a large retailer and you learn to keep on your toes. One is always on the go here but also learning nonstop. I can honestly say i love my job. I love knowing i have somewhere i can go and work in an upbeat environment.

The most enjoyable part of this job was see customers with a happy face once they had found everything they need and receive an excellent customer service from start to end of their visit to the store."
good,iwas ap/t temp ienjoyed it but at the end it was slow and flunked my
good,"Management had open door policy. Worked closely with management. Set up cash drawers for registers, reconciled receipts, printed out reports for managers and department heads. Handled deposits, change orders, computer problems. Hardest thing was standing on a concrete floor for your shift. Working the vault and helping set the store for its grand opening was extremely satisfying."
good,Good place to work when you are in school. It was related to my area of study but i still work there.
good,"I supervise all the cashiers and lot associates. I’m in charge of handling breaks, and lunches. While maintaining reports, paperwork, and handling incoming/ out coming cash. Customer service is my main focus when interacting with customers, whether it’s greeting or answer questions to their every need. I answer incoming phone calls, recovery; look up inventory, ringing up regular transactions while also handling exchanges & returns."
good,"typical day at work was always a good day .working with people that loved to come to work with no stress made the work enviroment worth working .The relationship that you build with your customer is very satifying beacause they leave with a smile and return with one ,because u stop and ask,' How are you today,Or 'Can i help you find something . The hardest part of my day will be having a upset customer.Having a happy customer make me enjoy my day"
good,"Home Depot is a fast paced and challenging place to work. It is a company that prides itself on promoting within. Many members of higher management have moved up through the company from a Lot Associate to levels as high as Regional Manager. Compared to other retailers, Home Depot has a higher rate of pay. The benefits provided include health, dental, and eye insurance, 401K with a match up to 5%, semi-annual Success Sharing, and discounted stock."
good,A typical day at work is purely assisting customers and cleaning departments. The hardest part of the job is keeping occupied in the slow season. It's a decent place of work if you can obtain full-time status.
good,great place just store i work at doesnt provide enough hours
good,A day at work is getting your order processing them and making any adjustment that needed to be made.
good,I was required to be at work at 6:00a.m. Mondays through Fridays. I was responsible for pulling orders from contractors and preparing them wither for delivery or customer pickup. I learned valuable people skills and how not to get between two rival managers. there was one other associate in my department as well as a dedicated cashier and Pro-Desk Manager. We got along well most of the time. My department head had a particular way about him that did not sit well with upper management. I was drawn into the middle of their issues and I did not appreciate it. The most difficult part of the job was showing up to work first and being responsible for loading everything before the delivery drivers showed up. The most enjoyable was having the afternoon to myself and able to start classes to further my education.
good,"Family atmosphere, room for advancement, accessible to questions and guidance."
good,Learned a lot of productive procedures with logistics and team member leadership. Guest service training was always number one

Entering personal information in the computer system and setting up appointments for in home estimates. I learned alot working at The Home Depot such as how to make the customers feel valued and keeping them satisfied. My co-workers were all very nice, professional and helpful.

The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with my customers and working with the people."
good,I enjoyed the job. Management was nice. Great interaction with coworkers.
good,"I am responsible for developing clients on an ongoing basis, resposible for inventory and merchandising of my department, and I support both personal and store sales goals within a team enviornment"
good,My experience with Home Depot was that the coworkers interact more like a family than simply coworkers.
good,trains you for other fork lifts.
good,"*My typical day at work is scanning products in exchange for payment such as processing debit and credit cards, processing checks, and scanning gift cards."
good,"A very good job to get me through college, but time to move on to a better job, with better pay."

good,"Good noproblems. I learned lot of things at home depot how to work in the wharehouse, receiving & shipping, stocking, Lumber,"
good,NOthing is typical at Home Depot. Everday is a learning experience. Managing the Pro Sales department allowed you to see growth and work towards goals. Working with contractors and the homeowner can be challenging and them sharing what they want to do is amazing.
good,Great place to work at where you could learn something new about anything every day
good,"Considering my position. As long as all of my cashiers and lot technicians there's a smooth day. But if there's one call out, well that can take a toll as a head cashier. I would have to rearrange breaks and lunches. when i go to lunch i would have to let a manager know so he/she can watch the front end operations."
good,"supervised 45 plus some employees. Processed cash transactions.Provided customer service, Processed and handled paperwork pertaining to shipping and receiving returns. Developed employee schedules. Critiqued and provided written performance reviews on employees."
good,The environment of Home Depot is wionderful for beginners that are looking to learn all aspects of a company. This company gives you the opportunity to gain knowledge and expertise that can be carried with you throughout your career.
good,"Generally speaking, a great entry level job with large amount of knowledge to be gained. Started on overnight recovery team and was shortly moved to the sales floor. I returned to the overnight team due to conflicting schedules, and the management was more than happy to assist. The hands on training I receive on a daily basis helps keep the job from becoming predictable."
good,We would have our daily meeting than management would tell us what areas in the store they would like us to work on.
good,"good working experience, good co-workers and flixible hours"
good,"Very busy fast pace enviroment. learned alot, how to design kitchens, install a toliet, lay flooring tile. The management team is very skillfull and trained. Co-workers are fun and very knowledgable. The hardest part is keeping up with the fast pace of the enviroment. Is working with the co-workers and management planning events for the associates."
good,"Typical day at work would involve getting store grand ready open. Ensure that we have associates in positions to provide customer service but at the same time changing things in the store to remain constannt and fresh. Home Depot provides an extensive training program that prepares associates prior to going to the sales floor but demands that they train constantly every year. The primary function I had was to increase the installation business in the store and manage that part of the business. Management initially was not effective in development and growth of other managers but over the past several years that has changed for the better. Most co-workers work well with each other and work to get the job done. Hardest part of the job, can be preparing for unannounced visits or 24 hr notice on audits. Enjoyable part is satisfying the customers and seeing an associate that you hired several years ago get promoted to a supervisor position"
good,My job consisted of answering customer questions and taking payments for merchandise purchased at the service desk. I also processed in store credit applications as well as rental of store truck. I also scheduled installations for customers with various vendors as well as serve as the store operator and answer incoming calls and direct to the appropriate departments.
good,"Typical day would be standing at the cash register checking out customers until somebody from management would ask me to do another job like building shelves, building displays for vanities, push carts, or help customers get their items in their car. I enjoyed almost everyone I worked with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a certain manager who would tell me to go and build something then ask why I am not at the register. The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers."
good,"Finding and assisting customers and constant inventory updating, Learning new things about store and products everyday."
good,"Very hard to have a family life, never have the same days off weeke by week. pay is okay. co workers are always helpful and fun."
good,"I was a supervisor for 3.5 years over various dept. at The Home Depot and for the most part it was a good experience. I learned a great deal about common retail business practices, how to manage and motivate associates, also how t ogenerate sales results. probably the toughest part of the job is managing and satisfying very tough customers, but they are just another opportunity to win a customer over with great customer service and commitment to them."
good,"It was okay to work for home depot. Some of the other associates weren't good to work with,"
good,"It really depends on which Home Depot your hired at and the location when it comes to the pay. It have decreased over the years due to the economy. Regardless of if your part-time or full-time your able to accumulate payed sick days and vacation time which was great. Management also depends on the location. I went from great management in Emeryville, Ca to childish messy management in Sacramento, Ca. Overall its a great company."
good,I learned alot at this workplace. I enjoyed most of the people I worked with.
good,This is a good place to work. There are plenty of opportunities to advance in the company and they take care of their employees.
good,"I was a Hardware Associate assisting customers with the tools, hardware for the project they were working on."
good,"Managing ,Planning and working with associates as well as customers.Have learned to multitask and work with very diverse customers and associates."
good,"good place to work, good benefits and a chance to learn new things every day . you get to work with good people"
good,"When I get into work I immediately go to my appliance department and review yesterdays notes. I check to see if I had any customer issues that need to be addressed. Afterwards, I walk around Appliances and Kitchen Designs checking for anything that needs to be fixed, cleaned, or re-stocked. I work with great co-workers and managers! Everyone works together as a team because at Home Depot we put customers first. The most difficult part of my job is balancing my personal life with my work. Working in retail has taken a toll on my husband, my family, my friends and my school work. The BEST part of my job is my co-workers. I really love the people I work with. They are my extended family."
good,I have been completely satisfied with my part time job.I would recommend this job to anyone looking for a great company to work for.
good,i wasnt making enoffmony so i found differnt employment most of the supervizers r good to work under but i just did not get along with the frontend superziver
good,great company to work for with great pay and opportunity to advance. Has tranning and people to help improve your knowledge for home improvement.
good,I think that Home Depot is an excellent company for taking care of their associates and constantly looking for ways to improve their business.
good,"It's a great place to work if you're single or married. The scheduling is flexible, opportunity to learn a lot of new things, and meet amazing people."

good,"The Home Depot allowed me to not just stand in one place all of the time, but to move around and help customers in different parts of the store. I enjoyed to ability to help when I was out on the floor and not back in an office."
good,Great company to work for. The working atmosphere was great and management was friendly.
good,Home Depot was a great working/learning experience you had the opportunity to grow within the company. It was really like a family experience.

good,Home Depot is a wonderful place to work. They make sure that you fully understand your task at hand before sending you out to work. The Home Depot offers hands- on training that helps you to undersatnd your work more effectively. The pay is great and they work with your schedule.
good,"Enjoyed my time at home depot! I learned a lot about meeting the needs of multiple customers at one time! I learned do things I never imagined such as mix paint, cut carpet, make keys, study different flowers and place special orders for larger companies using contracts"
good,"As with any big company, there are talented people and not so talented people. I was given huge responsibility to get new stores and other facilities built on schedule and in budget. Unfortunately, it was huge travel ... almost every week all across the US. From that perspective (1997-2005) when we were building as many as 200 stores per year, the work load was really heavy. It is probably much better now since they might be building 20 stores per year."
good,"Home Depot is a big retailer that does have a heart.   The job is a bit more physical, and that is just the nature of it, but they make an effort to be inclusive and are very open to communication with employees.  Management values suggestions, provides training, and coaching opportunities, and gives regular reviews, so there is more job security, and  employees have a clear sense of what's expected of them."
good,"Great place to work, they treat their employees well. They provide benefits for part time employees who work at least 20 hours/week. Home Depot is focused on providing excellent customer service, so being able to work with customers is necessary."
good,I been at the homedepot going on 10 years . The culture of the build is really good . They take care of their people. I recommend people to give it a try.
good,I love the environment at The Home Depot. It really feeling like a welcoming and supporting environment. When I first started there I was welcomed with open arms. Other employees would come up to me and introduce themselves and welcome me. It made me feel really good about working there! The only thing that I would like to improve is more shift options. In my department there are only 3 shift options and only one person can have each of there's shifts. I just wish I could have a better shift that would be more beneficial to me and my college classes but there is no way for me to get a better shift unless that person steps down.
good,Everyday you help and guide people to product they need for there project. Making sure everything is stoked and front face (pushed forward) items. Asking customers if they need help with anything and putting away any items that have been returned. Also helping customers find the paint they need and want.
good,Working at home depot was a great experience but after I transferred to another location I started to receive less hours to work per week  Sometimes 4 or 8 hours for one week
good,"everyday isn't the same, no matter how the day gets it'll be okay. the management was kind of stubborn with pay even if you work the hardest there but overall a good work environment and great employees."
good,The workplace is where everyone works and help others resolve problems. The atmosphere is completely different compared to my previous jobs. The only downfall is that the managers don’t really pay attention to workers that actually do their jobs correctly.
good,Had similar issues here that I did at other employers. Typical workplace drama that management does not do a great job at correcting or eliminating. Company itself mostly takes care it's employees.
good,I liked working here. I was paid well and given plenty of hours to work. Make sure you show up on time and ready to work. The people you work with are great.
good,"Great place to work in a team and helps to handle challenging situations in the store. Employee relations is an asset, problem-solving skills is very useful during your work."
good,Worked at Home Depot for many years until I relocated to New York with my wife.  Looking to return to the work force  after taking care of my daughter.
good,"Overall a good place to work while being indoors, with a nice break room. Managers and employees are laid back. Also a non stressful work environment. If you like helping people Home depot is the place for you."
good,The rating that I have reviewed above feels pretty good to actually put together the real meaning of what Home Depot is offering to the associates that also feel the need to rate the store.
good,"I loved working at home depot. The sense of community was great, as well as, the management there. I had a great time and made some awesome connections"

good,"Great stock incentives job growth locations worldwide competitive salary"
good,I enjoyed working at Home Depot mostly because of the work environment. Everyone from the Manager to the entry level associates were nice and friendly.
good,They are sincerely concerned about there employee's and they have bonus programs and company parties for all employee's. they have cook outs for employee's that involves all shifts and last all day soeveryone can be involved.
good,"Working at Home Depot there is a sense of belonging with everyone. Every employee makes other employees and customer feel like it is there second home. Knowing many of the customers by name and creating a bond with them."
good,"Buenos procesos...."
good,"- Skills are taught before expected"
good,"A typical day at work as a garden associate at Home Depot involved me putting on my apron, grabbing a phone, and walking around the inside/outside garden area, looking for people to assist, clean the area, or learn more about the products we sold. If there's enough people doing the same thing in the garden area, I would go into the back and continue training for more responsibilities such as forklift certification or learning the pros and cons of Home Depot's variety of power tools and general knowledge of the plants we sell."
good,My experience there was very informative. I had to learn quickly because the customers expect the associates to know how to build everything. Over time this knowledge was instilled on me and I was able to effectively help out customers.
good,"Empresa socialmente responsable, buen ambiente laboral, ofrece cursos de capacitación constante."
good,"Great job to build up experience. This atmosphere was great and people were amazing. Good Advantages working here as well as an high school  student. Pretty decent to start off,"
good,"We got to assemble all sorts of products and product displays.  We set up all the seasonal merchandising stuff, including blow-up Santas and scary Halloween decorations!  The tasks can be repetitive and boring at times, but the people make it fun!"
good,"This store has great managers who do what they can to fit your needs, there’s friendly staff both day shift and night shift, and it has fair pay and equal opportunity for everyone."
good,"The Home Depot contact center is undeniably one of the best cultures to work in. There are many wonderful aspects. Only caution is that Vacation time benefit is not ideal. "
good,"The managers were helpful, the locations were varied and they were willing to train any deficiencies that I had. in order to succeed. I enjoyed my time there."
good,"Employees are nice and helpful.  Slow paced job.  They do train in multiple types of fork lifts and order pickers.  No employee discounts, but do have health benefits.  Over all atmosphere seems relaxed."
good,"considering that I was unprepared mentally and physically for my position as a Freight Associate, I still enjoyed my job to a certain degree. Unfortunately, due to some unforeseen circumstances, I had to quit. I really liked my managers and most of my coworkers were supportive, although not very work-driven. Had I been around long enough to see the necessary adjustments to our work infrastructure come to pass, I would be giving a more satisfied review."
good,Friendly environment and comes with good benefits. Managers and assistant managers are nice people you can talk to them almost about anything and paid extra holidays.
good,normal clock in clock out type of  job. Good work environment. Shifts can change but overall scheduling was not bad. As long as you did what you were suppose to nobody messed with you.
good,Good and easy laid back place to work. Managers really go out of there way to make sure you are taken care of and happy. Getting time off is easy when it’s needed. Shifts are three 12s.
good,"This location on Superstition Springs is ever evolving. The leadership is very goal oriented, communicates clearly, and takes the time to ensure you understand. The associates are friendly and most have extremely high work ethics. This is an inviting work environment that one can easily settle into and succeed. Promotion ability is based on work capability, the harder you work the greater your potential for promotion."
good,A large company with onsite perks. I learned its a lot about networking on campus and trying to see how you can add value. Enjoyable part you meet alot of people and there are always volunteer opportunities.
good,".... depending on the location you work at. My first store was simply amazing, I hated to go, my coworkers were great my supervisor was even better. I was fairly miserable at my second location. While some go workers were great others felt threatened. I was given a hard time on getting too many credit cards, was given a hard time opening them. It was a hassle. Still visit my first store when my time permits it."
good,Not enough loading employees . Plant’s didn’t cared for good. The employees needed more training in the department they worked in. Some of the rules where not clear and cause slot of misunderstandings
good,I love being a cashier and meeting all types of people and this job is the perfect job for this to happen every day.  The only bad part is how hard the cement floor is on feet and legs and back.  This is the only bad I have found about working there.
good,The atmosphere over there is good.we have to work hard over there. I learn many things over there how to work in a team. Be punctual. Staff was good in home depot.
good,"The Home Depot is as good a job as you make it. Advancement is available if you work hard and have a good attitude. Health, dental and vision benefits are good and Paid vacation sick leave."
good,"If you want good hours and nice people work with, Home Depot was a surprising place I've worked for. Co-workers were very nice and helpful, and we all got along. Working in the garden dept. was really great as I stayed busy most of the time and got to know other departments as well. Time went by pretty fast because I was so busy. I was hired right before the summer, so hours were great for my schedule. I will admit that sometimes harassment was an issue for me and other girls, but for those who were aware of it were extremely helpful. Managers were nice to be around too. My favorite thing to do there was working with the kids workshop on the first Saturday of every month. I loved working with kids and their families work on a different craft. Overall good place to work and I would work there again if I would need a part-time job at some point."
good,buen ambiente y se piensa mucho en el bienestar del colaborador
good,The job was very interesting and I did have some fun times there. I was there for a long time because I felt secure and I enjoyed the benefits from the company.
good,Home depot pro (warehouse side) of home depot is a lot better then store side in my opinion. The warehouse gives you more of an opportunity to grow and they strive to help you improve in anyway they can help you.
good,"Working at home depot taught me alot about customer service skills and how to handle work and my daily life. It gave me experience in other departments as well such as garden, building and lumber, paint, and electrical. Working there gave me valuable experiences and knowledge over understanding more about a job than just your own department."
good,This is a good company to work for. Care about the employees and customers. Veteran friendly. While working with this company I felt a part of the family. They would go the extra mile to help work around any problem and assist if possible with any personal issue.

good,es una empresa con jornadas largas de trabajo y politicas rigidas en incentivos
good,"Home Depot has a stigma of providing the best customer service, having respect for all people, and taking care of their employees. No place is going to be perfect, but my location had all of these things. The benefits are great, but the pay wasn't good enough for as much work as I took upon myself. What's required of you really isn't that much, and it's a positive environment. I would recommend anyone to start here, but as a contractor who was looking for steady work that could use my skills, this place held me down and didn't pay enough."
good,Great place to work if you want to meet new people learn new things and always busy have fun helping customers with their questions and giving direct attention 2 their concerns
good,"I was a front line worker for the garden department. I was not the manager, but I was her right hand. I lead my small team though the days to get things done. But in a fun, professional way. I learned nearly all of my skills from here. I always challenged my self here to learn new things. I learned all my lift truck training here. Management was not great, but it did not bother me."
good,Good company but manager retention at the store level is horrid. They do however try to strive for diversity and inclusion but tend to neglect newer associates.
good,"trabajo sobre resultados, con un agradable ambiente laboral"

good,"I like every thing except the salary, it is a shame on the home depot to pays 11$/h at 2020, managers are nice, respectful, but some times useless, hear you with left ear and your words go through the right one."
good,"Great company,  great benefits,  great atmosphere ."
good,Great coworkers and teamwork!  I enjoy working with everyone.  The Home Depot provides great work environment and flexible scheduling for all employees.

Aim for full-time."
good,The first month was a bit rough since you didn't get the best of training but once you got the hang of things it was a great place to work. Just give it a try and you will receive some great benefits from working there.
good,"Sometimes management isn't always on point. They can forget to punch in vacation or sick hours, they can ask too many personal question or over step their boundaries."

good,"A typical day included moving between assisting guests at self checkout and helping on mainline registers. Our management was always available and ready to assist in time of need. I learned a lot about the store and the products we carried and that your need a good quality pair of sneakers to make it through your shift comfortably. The more difficult part of your day would be when it gets slow and your left to think about how much your feet hurt. But your coworkers were always there to help boost your mood throughout your shift. Everyone there smiled at one another and genuinely cared about one another. No one care about gender, race, age, or any other labels. We all just wanted to make sure everyone was going to have a good day."

good,The Home Depot had a productive hard working environment with good people that you could have fun at work with but still get the job done in a safe and timely manner.
good,Everyday was good to be there but sometime's it was a little hard work to do and i worked there for about 3yrs  i also was a casher and i also did some flooring work as well.
good,I was originally hired as a part time employee and have been on staff for several months.  I'm very pleased with my supervisors and would recommend this place as they are very sensitive to employee needs.

good,Great company to work for. They are willing to advance you on positions you feel that you show the potential in helping the customers with their diy projects.
good,Good for a part-time job fresh out of high school and in college. The opportunity of advancement was enticing but I would've prefered it to take place at another store due to the relationship with management. Pretty much had the same tasks day-to-day with the exception of busy work if it was a slower day.
good,Working with this company has made me a better person. They flexibility they gave you to do your personal things. Supervisor work with you with any problem you have being personal or work related.
good,Mostly for freight associates to my knowledge. For the work we had to do we got under payed and were treated unfairly always getting blamed for day crew's mistakes.
good,bonne experience  pour un moi mais malheureusement le salaire n'est assez suffisant.
good,"THD is like a big family. We build relationships with each other and with our customers. Friendly people. I have learned so much about thousands of products that we carry. I am able to answer questions, to help customers get everything needed to finish their project. I have been able to advance my knowledge in the technology field. On the sales side, I have learned the ins and outs of the ordering systems. The most challenging part of my career here has been learning to operate returns system correctly. I enjoy learning new things. I enjoy being challenged. Home Depot has taught me a lot."
good,"the management at the home depot is amazing very flexible and understanding about schedule conflicts and other life events that might keep you from coming in, they also have an amazing training system and they make sure you are 100% trained online and they have you shadow then practice on a register then ask if you think you're ready for customers"

good,I have learned so much in the last few months at Home Depot. I am now certified to drive a Forklift which can benefit me later for advancement. I would like to have  full time positions so I can have benefits.
good,Home depot is not a bad place at my location. My job is fun but some of my associates don't help me finish the job at the end of the night. Home depots greatest pro is flexible hours. Accountability is an issue.
good,I've always wanted to be an Engineer. As a kid I wanted to be Tarzan. As an adult I became an Engineer. I have never regretted that decision. I need 9 more characters.
good,Just like any day at work I help in every department!  I assist associates as well as managers on daily inventory and customers for merchandise knowledge.

good,Home Depot is a world of its own. Very exciting once you get to know everything one and the departments. Lots of opportunities for growth. Friendly & helpful employees.
good,If you are a hard worker Home Depot is a great place for you. If you are too slow or you dont learn the job fast enough it won't work out. The wages are typically higher than most retailers.

good,I loved working for The Home Depot. The tasks were always a good challenge that kept  me busy. I liked the steady pace of work and the change of tasks from shift to shift.
good,"i found the other associates very friendly and helpful.i learned alot about lawnmowers,bbq grills,flowers,etc.bags of rock are too heavy from the 3rd shelf tho.all in all it was one of the nicest, enjoyable jobs ive experianced."
good,It's fun if you like helping people and learning about all the possible home improvements that are possible. Management does not like to hire more than they need to causing a lot of stress on those who have to cover more than one department when another associate is taking their lunch.
good,"A good place to work for a part time employee.  the job has flexible scheduling and the supervisors are pleasant.  The overall working environment is clean, safe and enjoyable."
good,Pay needs to be higher for the amount of work and stress. Pay needs to equal the amount of work given to the employees. Not enough people to cover the sales floor.
good,Wasn’t bad easy flow good amount of work decent people the ability to have a personal life with good compensation the shifts are flexible and the job was easy to pick up with out much experience

good,It is a really good place to work for and they offer competitive wages and benefits. You learn a lot about customer service and they treat the employees well
good,"My work experience was a decent one, minimal work hours with little incentives or direction to give you full time. Its a nice job to have if you're going to college."
good,It is as good as retail can get. The hours are all over the place but you do get paid a decent amount. If you work hard you will get promoted.  Positions in management are always available.
good,"Working at the home depot is fun and exiting. You come in everyday and greet all your co-workers. When you clock in, the customers are for the most part friendly. Working at the home depot definetely makes you improve your people skills."

good,Good company to work for not enough pay and management is good they do care for their employee and the benefit and discounts they offer are great and it’s good environment
good,"We help all customers to have convenience and value when they shop in our area.  A typical day is about 60% helping customer solve their shopping needs in our department, 20% stocking shelves bringing overhead stock down by ladder and machine, 10% helping customers in other departments and 10% processing returns."
good,Good people. Good pay. Good management. Good benefits. Job wasn't difficult. Opportunity for advancement. Opportunity for transfer and working in different locations.

good,The Home Depot allows good exposure to various area of the company and starting at entry level allows to learn a lot about the company.  Best thing is the gym inside the building.

good,"I enjoyed my time at home depot. I met many great people and learned many new skill sets that I use today. It's a great work environment, the paint department especially. I would definitely recommend Home depot to a friend looking for a job."
good,"Treats employees with respect, will work with you around unexpected life things. The pay is meh, but the benefits are pretty spectacular considering you get them even if you are only part time. One downfall is they hold onto people who have been there for a long time even when they are dragging a whole department down, not good for business OR moral."
good,"Overall, the job was good, despite there being some customers that should have been launched into the sun.  That is fairly normal for retail or jobs in general."
good,Great place to work although the pay rate could be better/more management is great and co workers are great as well. I would love to have a opening shift verses the one that i have i am a morning person and usually work a second job this time of yr to send my kids and grands Christmas gifts.
good,"Being that I was a merchandising associate I enjoyed helping the customers. My job was confusing because you would have some supervisors that wanted you to help the customers and you had others that didn't. I am very big on customer satisfaction because it makes the customer want to return even if they do not always agree with the prices. they feel better when dealing with a familiar face, especially the contractors. I think the hardest part of my job may have been working out in the elements. Extreme heat and extreme cold can really help you to realize your age when it wants too."
good,"Decent place to work , with nice people the management where I worked were fair and nice people. My hours worked around my very unpredictable schedule."
good,Overall the job is very customer orientated. You need to be very flexible and be able to help all over the store. Be prepared to stand a lot and sometimes deal with angry customers.
good,"A typical day at work involves cress professional, customer service oriented with ability to discern irregular situations, think quickly to solve minor problems, and keep the safety and security of the employees, visitors, and equipment safe.  "
good,"Generally a good place to work, a lot of mobility if you prove yourself and seek it out. However, depending on who your placed with you'll see quite a variance in work ethic."
good,I was trained to operate multiple machines. I handled many departments. I was thought details regarding each trade. I enjoyed doing projects overnight and seeing the change it made in the store.
good,"homedepotisgood,expgoodmangerscoworkersgood,hrsatworkarenotgoodatall!itsafunexcitingplacetoworkworkers,customers,andmanagers,sometimesgoodandfun,funnywhichisagoodforagoodthing"
good,I worked on the MET team there was a lot of team work to get projects done. There is deadlines but as long as you can manage your time it should be good.
good,My first store in TN was great to work in. Co-workers were the best. Moved to Fl and transferred to a store with poor management and co-workers who couldn't care less for others.
good,"Average day at work consisted of building and constructing display units to promote vendors products.  Assisting customers, and maintaining a family type work atmosphere."
good,Every team member had a great attitude and thoroughly enjoyed working there. Building and lumber manager actually worked with us and understood that it can be very busy and hard work at times.
good,Fast pace production. Very nice management. Easy to move up in the company and learn to operate all equipment in the warehouse. Employees all help one another with task.
good,My store was a fairly good place to work. Everyone did a good job collaborating and getting tasks done efficiently. The management was good at solving problems that were employee or customer related. Overall a good place to work.
good,"Tough times fun times angry customers..just laugh.."

good,"Everyday is mostly the same, with some change change every now and then. You have some things that you must do during your work day, the tasks are mostly easy. Hardest part is trying to get people to open up cards, you must ask everyone. The people are enjoyable, everyone is friendly almost like family."
good,Realm enjoyed working with employers they made me feel at home.the company treats you well.they have good health benefits as well as stock options.ect
good,"good starting job for teens. hard working environments. great management. equal opportunity."
good,Home depot was great to work at. I    was number 1 in lead Sales Generation. so I'm proud.. I loved my bosses and how they allowed me to be creative n independent.
good,"I worked Customer Service for almost year. At first it was a little difficult because there was so much to learn and not many people who knew how to teach or wanted to teach me new things. So I learned a lot on my own. I think it may be more of who you know in the store, because after being there for awhile I finally met a couple people who knew a lot about everything and anytime I had an issue or question I knew they would help me 100%. But overall it wasn’t too bad there. I interacted with a lot of customers and worked with employees, it’s definitely a teamwork makes the dream work kinda job. They also celebrated national days at the location I worked at, so for example if it was national donut day they would buy ALOT of donuts for the employees. They also try helping out employees that are going through financial issues as well as kept food in the break-room so if someone couldn’t afford their lunch they would have something to eat."
good,Outstanding team of associates. Willing to help when needed. Lots of room to advance. Management was opened to suggestions and complaints. Driving a company truck was stressful.
good,"This is a good Company to work for. I do recommend them as a great employer . You also will learn about tools, hardware and other items for sale at the store."
good,I enjoyed my time at The Home Depot its a diverse company to work for.  Home Depot's management are very innovative always forward thinking.  I enjoyed the Employee appreciation events.
good,There is always work to be done. The atmosphere is fun and very encouraging. Listening to people’s projects gets to be pretty interesting. Always be happy to help and you won’t have a problem
good,"It's a nice place to work, but customers can be a pain sometimes. Management tries their best to help out, but seems like the store is often times under staffed."
good,"Opportunists to lean and advance are there for the motivated."
good,"The workplace is very fast paced, with around 4-6 aisles dedicated to two or three associates at any given time. While majority of the workday consists of preparing the product, cleaning the aisles, and in Lumber and building materials you must flat stack and bring down lifts of lumber with a forklift. Providing excellent customer service is a must, trying to personalize the  shopping experience while providing effective and efficient  advice. The bonds you make with the customers is the best part at working at The Home Depot and that's really what makes it stand out from other retail stores"
good,"Enjoyed the Environment and fellow employees. Would suggest a more consistent work schedule. More ongoing training. "
good,"una compania pro-empleados y clientes, innovadora. dedicada al servicio al cliente.  Sus sistemas de trabajo muy actualizados, se especializa en entrenamiemto a sus empleados."
good,"The Home Depot is a good place they gave me experience in different topics like time management, and how to deal with difficult customers. I really enjoyed my time there"
good,"We had a great team work and I was able to learn 3 different apartments the whole year i worked there.  I was a cashier from there I went prodesk doing payments over the phone and customer services,"
good,I was attending college and they worked around my school schedule. It was close to school and they were easy to get along with. I enjoyed my time and the people were great.

good,"great place to work, management was cool and supportive, pay is really low unless you have been there for years or have special certifications or licenses."
good,It was a ok job I just didn’t have enough time to think when this gob was going on. This job also had poor management at the time I was a employee . Other than that there is no complaints.
good,"This is a tight-knit team that constantly strives to be the best they can be. Some great perks are short-day Fridays year round, yoga at the office, birthday celebrations, work outings and overall an energetic, positive, ever-evolving workplace."
good,"home depot is a great place to work, I really enjoy meeting different people, help customers as well as giving outstanding customer service,"
good,I like working for The Home Depot. It's a family experience everyone is open arms an there when needed. They have open schedule flexable time. An you move up on the business that's how i got fun time.
good,The hardest part about the job there is dealing and helping the customers with what they need. Sometimes they ask you for the craziest thing and get mad when we don't have their desired product
good,"Your Coworkers are not your competitors. You can go to them for feedback on a design or ask them to take care of your customer while you are on vacation. Pleasant work environment. Only way to advance would be to leave kitchen design and become management, which some people do. Pay raises are tiny and incremental, but you have fantastic health benefits, 401K, Stock Options and Profit sharing. It is a sweet package."
good,"I loved working at Home Depot because I love to help customers. Management is awesome and will work with you as long as you have a valid reason. If you do your best and show that you have the ability to move up in the company, doing so is fairly easy."
good,Teammates works good together employees assisted customers with any concerns or complaints big work environment. Breaks are to short good place to buy home improvements merchandise
good,The days went by smoothly as long as your worked and always seemed busy. I learned to read labels and use some technology to check the products. The management is very helpful and friendly. The workplace is very upbeat and fun to be around. Hardest part of the job is having to stay on top of the freight coming in and knowing where to place it.
good,Love to work in Home Depot managers and employees very nice and friendly the only problem is they pay you to little and it's not enough hours and if you work part-time there's no benefits

good,It is nice working at the Home Depot. The employees and the people there are lovely and nice. The job isn’t bad and the management is good. It’s is just the lack of hours and money that pull away a lot from this job. That is all.
good,I would work for the company again. It was a wonderful experience working in a wearhouse. I got to learn new things. And how to use the machine's. Hours was great . The staff worked together.
good,"It was a good first job , it opened some doors for me learning new things getting certified in some places giving me the ability to use that in the future."
good,"I would highly recommend this company for someone starting their first job, seasonal, or second income. You don't receive store discounts, but you have perks that's discounted on phones, travel, fitness, buying a car,  or house, etc... Management is reasonable. You could automatically start your 401(K) and stock market"
good,"Really like working there,  specially if you love helping customers and co-worker. Work was very busy all the time, which I like because made time go by fast. The company took care of employees by providing things for the summer heat, as well as working gloves."

good,"I enjoyed working at the Home Depot.  It was the perfect part time job."
good,As a kitchen designer I was well treated and well respected. Advancement and raises were appropriate. My sacrifices in personal time to satisfy customer needs was appreciated and compensated for.
good,This is another job that I worked outside for. Most of the employees and management understand that it is hot and are perfectly okay with you taking a few extra breaks and a few extra minutes for each break.
good,"I enjoyed early morning start times; very busy during the summer, fun helping people with their gardening needs & caring for all nursery stock."

good,I love the culture of the Home Depot.  The benefits are great.  They could be a little more competitive with the pay though. Management seems to really care about the employees. We're like family there.
good,"The only problem I’m having is trying to get rehired. I quit to relocate and they are saying I abandoned my position. Which I didn’t, I gave a notice, my mother, which has custody of my son, had to move to get out of a bad situation with my stepfather, so we did move and so I did give a week notice. But I didn’t abandon my position. I enjoyed my job here."
good,Very professional.  Positive feedback by managers.  Warm reception.  Pleasant environment.  Family-oriented.  Results-oriented.  Room for growth.  A respected company with values.
good,"I like my job at Home Depot, i just cant support myself on their salary. They have great management and push and encourage their employees to advance."
good,Company is customer oriented.  They realize the associale in the store is the most important employee because they are the face of the company.  They are who the customer see as the company.
good,"If you like a fun and fast pace of customer service this is the place to work, also something new to learn and exciting customers to meet, management and schedules are flexible, pay is competive."
good,"Home Depot is a family oriented type of work environment.  Management has an open door policy and is very supportive.  Customer service is a very challenging work environment, but with the right attitude, you stay busy and it can be mostly enjoyable.  The pay is low to start, as with most retail jobs, but the benefits available and room for advancement are a very good opportunity for young people starting out or as a part time job for someone who is retired or looking for a little extra money."
good,They gave benefits to both full time and part time associates but raises were not very high. Very team coordinated and customer service was a must have skill.
good,Home Depot provides a great work experience and career opportunity. With stable and gainful employment as well as health and aid and a healthy work environment your able to excell as a team member knowing that your status and position as an employee is secure.
good,"Great place to work over all. Management needs a better communication tact. the hourly pay and hours are fair when you are going to school, they definitely work around your schedule."
good,Its fun job but the pay and responsibilities you have don't match up. The only way to get better pay is by moving up. There is good chances you can get promoted with in if you really want it.
good,Home Depot is a great family environment from associates to customers. I don’t have anything bad to say about the company . I had a great experience from helping other departments as well as catering to each customer that walked through my department (lumber& bld mats)
good,As a sales associate I feel this is a good company to work for and would recommend anyone looking for an entry level job that pays decent and has flexible schedule
good,Good place to work and good team.  Stretches everyday.  Everyone is friendly.  Managers are very reasonable and fair. Lots of room for advancement. Lots of diversity.
good,"Working at Home Depot will have its pros and cons. On the pro side, you receive good benefits, you have paid time off, flexible scheduling (somewhat), 2 15 min PAID breaks minimum, and if you worked over 8 hours in your shift, you were given 2 15 minute breaks AND a 1 hour unpaid break. It was relaxing, and easy to catch onto things depending on your department, and it was very easy to receive hours if you really wanted them. Also, you would receive 3 weeks work of schedule so you won't ever have to wonder if you work."
good,"There are MANY good people at Home Depot who are a joy to work with and for. However, they do have a few ""bad apples"" that management always seems reluctant to get rid of. If your stuck with one of them, your screwed."
good,"A good place to start your career after serving in the Armed Services. "
good,I enjoy working at my store because everyone works as a team. We know how to get the job done safely and effectively.  Every night there will be a truck ready to unload and we work assembly line moving all products to the floor.  We complete the night with unloading boxes and filling overhead in proper departments.
good,"Home Depot is an awesome place to work. Management has a lot to do with the work ethic of the store. Some stores are managed better than others. When everyone is willing to work together a store can be totally awesome. Favoritism has no place in a workplace. If everybody came to work to work, life in some Home Depots would be a lot better."
good,Every day at the home depot is simple. It helped me communicate with others. The managers are friendly and are there to help when needed. The hardest part of the job at times is too many things going on at one time such as customers and projects that need to be done. The most enjoyable part is being able to get the job done nice and easy.
good,Would only get a few days a week with less than 8 hours. Benefits were good. There is plenty of room for advancement. But was pressured a lot to push their credit card since we had to meet a monthly quota.
good,Satisfactory overall but their communication regarding policy changes needs improvement.  Employees are not informed until after the changes are already made.
good,"The management is probably the thing that needs to be worked on the most, it lacks leadership but all in all the managers that do work there come through. They treat their staff very well, great opportunities to build your experience and job, and they host many great events. There is not a lot of staff on the floor, so when busy you can sometimes miss your lunches or breaks. They do need to have more coverage."
good,"Most of your tume will be spent helping customers throughout the store complete their shopping experience.  You will be assigned a department, be in charge of keeping product stocked on the shelves but mostly it will be your responsibility to make sure the customers have a positive shopping experience."
good,"The Home Depot is a great company with a great culture of doing the right things for the associates, customers, and share holders."
good,"It was a decent amount of work for a starting salary of minimum wage.  Many of the younger employees are part time, and you can tell that they aren’t motivated to work effectively and efficiently, this would lead to having to fix the mistakes or carelessness of others. More of a ‘can’t wait to get out of here’ attitude. That’s not to say that Everyone feels the same way, I really enjoyed working with a handful of people there. Management was always friendly."
good,"It reminded me a lot of buying your first car. They would take in people, dust them off, stand them on their feet and we'd all make some money. They listen to their people. Take the front line associates opinion seriously. Very well run business, I just wish they could pay more."
good,At the Home Depot you will learn a lot about home repair and dealing with customers. This company is great if your in college because HD will work around your schedule. Also there is a program that will reimburse you for your college expenses.
good,Good people with a friendly work environment with great safety standards. Management was fair and understanding. Job load was fairly easy to manage hardest part was unloading 1600 pieces off trucks.
good,Nice people to work with and positive outlook on community.  Have social gathering and information on how to work together and succeed.  Good benefits for par time and fulltime associates.
good,"There's always something to do at work, which always keeps you on your toes and helps you stay busy. MET projects are versatile and can be distributed to facilitate the skills of everyone on the team."
good,"not a bad place to work, work enviroment can get hot at times. good peple to work with, management needs a little attention to helping out other assciates when needed,"
good,the home depot is a good friendly work environment. the staff all works together to assist all customers in sales. the managers work closely with the staff to ensure all orders and product sales are accurate.
good,Very educational. I worked in hardware and really liked it. Most customers were Great to work with. I was working two jobs and left to go full time at my day job.  Good company to work for.
good,"Relaxed work attire, great supervisors, overall laid back environment. Found out about a lot of new easy innovative home improvement methods and tools."
good,"-Lots of opportunity to learn new things and to apply yourself in new ways"
good,Just like any job this is your basic customer service. Super easy is your looking for a minimum base pay. All you do it check out customers or manage self checkout
good,Home Depot does have great benefits compared to most 9-5 jobs you will find. They also have many opportunities to advance in the company if that is a personal goal.
good,"Working at Home Depot was a good first job , it wasn’t bad at all it was pretty easy. They had very good benefits but the hours weren’t good at all that was the only bad thing."
good,An awesome place to work! There are great benefits and the work environment is safe and fun! I would easily recommended this job for others even if you've never worked in a call center before.
good,"All Sales Associates are nice persons, they do a hard job and the company really work hard for making you feel good, you have about two annual bonuses that increase depending on your performance and a lot of more incentives."
good,When i first started at home depot i knew nothing about home improvement. This job has classes that teach you everything you need to know about your position and more. If you apply yourself and work hard tou can easily stand out and move up in the ranks. Within my first year i was a team leader and only 2 and a half years in i became a supervisor.
good,"Management is great. Feel like I can approach any manager and they have time to listen and have positive feedback. Flexible on hours and days you can work if part time and pay is good. Working at the service desk is stressful and a lot more is required for the same amount of pay as just being a cashier, so I think that should be addressed. Friendly atmosphere and we all love helping people which makes the Simpsonville location such a success in my opinion."
good,one of the best jobs I have had. I loved my coworkers and the job duties. it was such a joy to assist customers with projects and help them find the right tools and equipment to finish a job.
good,I will never forget that specific day that i went to work. I was standing on my register and  the costumer was having a bad day and took it out on me .Inew how to make  the costumers come  down and make him leave the store with a smile on there face. The manger was observing me in that specific moment and when the costumer left he came up to me and told me that my costumer service was amazing to keep ir up like that i kept on moving up .
good,"Like all big retailers home depot can be stressful, especially in the lumber department. But if you just stick to your department and try to do your best there, time should fly by."
good,I worked at the homedepot for 2 years. I started off as a cashier and soon learned just about every department. The management was fun and had a great work ethic. They had opportunities to rise through the ranks and gave pair time off even for parttimers. It is a very fasted paced job though. You will constantly be moving about.
good,"As an associate the consistent schedule is awesome, unfortunately, Supervisors/Management get various shifts. Pay is competitive for retail. Culture is very friendly and family oriented. Can be stressful at times with no coverage, also rewarding to help customers with all types of projects. Tons of advancement opportunities within comany outside of the store."
good,"Co workers are the best, eveyone is very friendly.  I like meeting all the contractors too. Management is helpful, I like working in different departments"
good,The work environment is a place where you don't have to stress going to because you're surrounded by people who appreciate their job and who are at ease in what they do.
good,It helped me too learn Spanish and helped me with my professional speaking. I would recommend this job too more people. I enjoyed my time here. you meet a lot of people and have fun.
good,This was my favorite job to work at! Its something about the people and the environment there. I felt like they really care! I enjoyed working hard with the people at this job
good,"Home Depot hires a diverse amount of employees. Despite differences in cultural backgrounds, fellow associates are always nice and respectful. However, it is difficult to move from a part-time associate to full-time."
good,"Gives proper training, autonomous entrepreneurship, great working environment. Great benefits and ability to succeed. Allows associates to try new things and departments."
good,Good company to work for they look out for fellow associate. You also two bonus checks from the company if u fall on hard times they have programs that will help you
good,"i worked customer service desk, therefor it was very fast paced and i had to make sure i kept track of my customers, i really liked helping all the customers and learned all the systems"
good,It’s a good company.  They do care about their workers.  I would recommend people to work there.  Overall it was a pleasant experience.  I appreciate the chance to work there
good,Too much pack-down during busy hours and this should have been done the night before the next day. The management should have weekly plans that should have tracked everyday activities to accomplish sales targets.
good,"Management is great, the only sad thing is that working part time is not something you’d enjoy doing especially if you’re someone who really needs money. The hours vary and can leave you working only 8 hours per week."
good,"Great first job workplace, and coworkers. Great benefits, and able to pick your job schedule. The hardest part of the job is Black Friday. The day goes by fast."
good,They will give a good training about the company and your job position. Help you to move up the latter. I am enjoying the culture of the Home Depot. I always focus in helping customers to have a great shopping experience by providing them with a premier customer service.
good,Good to be able to help customers. Pay is not great but it’s fairly easy work. It’s important to gain as much knowledge about the products as possible. Coworkers were always helpful whenever I had problems.
good,They offer great benefits and decent pay. If you show dedication to the company they will show it in return. They care about their employees and strive to take care of their people and customers.
good,"Honestly, working at The Home Depot was very nice. The Job environment is fantastic and management is always really quick to assess situations and fix them as quickly and as timely as possible. We were always able to cater to the customers needs in a timely and professional manner. It never really infringed on my outside life either. It was really easy to work around the times given to me, and if I needed a change it would be implemented at the earliest convenience. The only issue is the pay. The job itself isn't directly difficult but the work load is tremendous. Overall it just doesn't pay enough for the work required to maintain it. That would be my only nitpick at THD. Other than that its an amazing place to work and I would highly recommend others to try to work there."
good,"The Home Depot is an excellent place to work. The people are friendly and the managers are great. It’s a really good environment. The job isn’t difficult and the pay is above others. Really, a great place."
good,"For the most part, my coworkers and I got along. I mean, occasionally there were little disagreements about things but generally everyone works together. You have to know who's your friend and who's not."
good,"Starting working at The Home Depot I was surprised to see just how much the values of the company are upheld by management (at my store at least) I saw that we truly do put our customers first and then they take care of us before themselves. "
good,Working at Home Depot was a very nice experience. Hours were consistent and money was nice. The bosses were very kind and understanding when it came to school or other personal issues.
good,"its a great company, you learn a lot about the home improvement industry especially, and how to provide great guest service. recommended for any new graduate or high schooler."
good,"All of the management is super nice and really boost your moral whenever they can, they offer their support and help as often as you need it. Willing to accommodate with your needs as long as you don't betray their trust, great workers and great management."
good,"It was a pleasant experience and i recommend the job to anyone.Stocking was a good job and enjoyed the fact that the managers were pleasant , everything was pleasant"
good,"Looooovvvveeee"
good,it was a good job when i worked there i had a baby in the teething stage it was hard to get up and be there at 530 am after being up with the baby. they are fun and depending on the job could get overtime i was MET team
good,The Home Depot is a really fun place to be. The database is so expansive I couldn't even grasp everything that was in the MyApron dashboard. There were so many opportunities to learn about everything from volunteering to retirement plans. I felt very safe at Home Depot and my associates were cared for.
good,"I enjoyed working there tremendously. Management is under a lot of stress, but the pressure is not shared downwards. Job is extremely easy and enjoyable if you handle responsibilities efficently.  It is a job for someone who loves people."
good,Home Depot was great work environment. Great work team. The customer service experience was great. I would totally recommend it to either friends or family to work there.

good,The Home Depot is a job that can better your knowledge of household products and teach you how to do DIY projects. The atmosphere is dependant on the associates and management.
good,I loved the job and the work environment I just didn’t keep the job for only 4 months do to moving but I would work there again if I could. Everyone was nice and willing to help out a new employee.
good,"I really enjoy working at HD. I meet new people, i learn new information about my job and i just enjoy the overall vibe with my team mates. Everyday is different."
good,"A typical day at work : shelf maintenance, stock shelves with incoming new merchandise, assist customers and try to up-sell merchandise [ accessories ] they may need to complete project at hand.  Openers have to make sure the store safety checklist is done daily, ensuring no overhead stock is protruding from racking, areas that are supposed to be under lock and key - are.   Make sure that there is no garbage on sales floor [ trip hazards ] and other items are done on checklist. The biggest item of all is keeping the customers happy and wanting to make 'your store' a destination they want to come back to."

good,Friendly good people customers customer friendly nice store managers fair competitive work place in a good way pleasure to go to work would love to go back
good,I started as a part time cashier hoping to move into a full time management role over time.  i was told because of my ada accommodations that this wasnt possible. Very unfortunate because i am a very hard worker with excellent attendance.
good,It's a fun company to work for Relaxing environment friendly people whom you are working aside that will help you with anything. Customers are very kind and generous and the management team is great you can go to them at anytime to get assistance on any projects that are are working on.
good,"It could be fun to work there depending who you worked with on your shift. As most managers, ours preferred smooth sailing and detested when someone rocked the boat. I am a natural born boat rocker. It also seemed that the managers played there favorites by their skill set."
good,I didn't work for them I worked with them. I was the account manager who dealt with all of their store-customer deliveries. They were generally good to work with
good,My review was superb considering I had a medical emergency with my left kidney. I had a cyst on my left kidney that was giving me a great deal of problem. I'm so grateful that my workplace gave me the opportunity to take care of my myself.
good,Unload trucks put freight on shelf fet rid of garbage bring down stock . drive machines help customers with their needs in every department help customers load

good,"the job is laid back it would be a great job for people , they have great benefits and they will work with you on your hours , it’s a fun job if you get the job you’ll like it..."
good,Management is not hovering over you at all times. A very laid back environment but installs hard work. Managers are understanding. Good hours depending on which department you're in.
good,Great company with great benefits with above average pay across the board. Management is very helpful and if shown that you can and will work hard and willing to learn they will give you an opportunity to advance within the ranks and you can do it fast.
good,I've worked several sales verticals over the years.... as far as brick and mortar retail sales goes it is a good company to work and for those first timers a good learning platform.

Management has improved since I first started working there. Management and other employees are always willing to work with you when you need help."
good,Some of the staff was rude and management did nothing about it. Otherwise a majority of the staff was wonderful. Working at home depot is a very slow job.

good,Takes time but with the right amount of worth and if your truly dedicated you will succeed. Very respectful staff and very knowledgeable on product and locations
good,"Everyone was really nice. The managers seemed like they genuinely wanted to help if you had a problem and they weren't intimidating. Other staff were also very nice, no brooding edgy kid, or intimidating big guy who doesn't talk, everyone was just nice."
good,"not enough help in all departments, very poor security against theft.  People just walk right out the door with high dollar items and you can't stop them.  Cost the company hundred of thousands of dollars every month."
good,Home Depot is a good company to work for. Good culture and great people to work with. Lots of different personalities. I dont think I would enjoy a position as a store associate but working on the MET team is usually fun and a more family feel within the team. It can be a physically demanding job at times but for the most part its a decent job and I'd do it again.
good,I worked at the paint department mixing paint and helping customers with the paint problems I learned a lot about paint and the quality of the different type of paint
good,I enjoyed it. Every few days or so they would bring food in and feed all the employees. I worked in the back with a small team so we were pretty good friends outside of work. It's what you choose to make of it.
good,"Decent hours, opportunities to advance in the company, we’ll payed. I received multiple certifications and pay raises while I worked here. Great company."
good,"Busy place "
good,"I found HD a very pleasant job to work at. I started as an Assistant Kitchen Designer with plenty of training in house, able to satisfy my customers with the best service and product for them. I was then given a raise and promotion to Lead Generator which involved combing the store helping customers with a company from HD to fix or install their needs. It was gratifying to be able to help so many customers."
good,Home depot is a great place to work. They have taught me a lot about warehouse business. I have learn very fast. I started has an overnight freight team to sale person.

good,I am the opener for the flooring department I am always there and on time. Every morning I walk my department and make sure everything looks safe and able to be shopped by our customers. I walk my department once again to see what I need to pack down so the customer is capable to shop. making sure to greet customers at all times even when i am doing my daily pack down. At times it might get a bit hectic with not having enough coverage and having to deal with bringing pallets down. I am capable to drive the reach with no problem which helps me out a lot when it comes to helping out customers and my fellow co-workers.
good,Productive work days when not in slow season. Always willing to give overtime when available. Great management and room for advancement. Fun atmosphere overall.
good,"Great management team, employees work well together, fast paced during day shift, slower paced at night with mild rushes, busy during holiday seasons."
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for. There are a lot of great benefits, aside from just health, dental, vision, and 401k. Women get 12 weeks of paid maternity leave, and men get 6 weeks of paid parental leave. That's rare no matter where you go, and it's awesome that a retail company can offer that. The job can be stressful at times because you're in customer service dealing with the public, and let's face it, people aren't always nice."
good,Our store is family orientated. We treat each other with respect. I enjoy working here and I would recommend  it to anyone. Im supported with the decisions I've made and I love it.
good,It was a great job for me it was only temporary so never experienced much but occasionally they would bring food for the employees. Stay with the company but make sure you find a department you will enjoy.
good,la carga no es tan grande a excepciona de los días cuando hay demasiados clientes y poco personal
good,"This company is a great way for a teenager , retired or any individual who doesn't have any work experience to start off. Wish that due to the amount of hard work the associates put in, there needs to be at least a $2 raise for the employees,especially the Lot associates and cashiers."
good,Good place to work at and management was good. I am a concientious and resourceful worker. Was awrded cashier of the month three times within a six month period.
good,"Lots to learn and do small advancements but not alot of chances to go higher. Enjoyed working there just needed a change of pace, many demands on time ."
good,"Ok place to work,  no room to move up in the company. When you are on the floor it is difficult to get help and often times you have to do most of the work yourself."
good,"As long as you are busy, management is cool."
good,I believe that The Home Depot has a strong set of core values. I try to apply these values to my life outside of The Home Depot. The company structure made it an enjoyable place to work.
good,"f For 18 months of the 2 years that I worked at Home Depot I was continually harassed by a coworker. Went to management several times about it which invariably made the situation for me worse. The harassing coworker would be reprimanded and then turn around and harrssed me worse. I said some words to him, he reported me and I got fired. His position in the company was more valued than was mine. He drove a reach truck, I didn't."
good,I loved working here and would recommend it to anyone looking for a job. I worked in various departments but I started in the parking lot loading cars and pushing carts. The workplace culture was incredible as if everyone who worked there was family. The hardest part about the job is attendance in that they are very strict about time punches and being late. The most enjoyable part of the job again was the community.
good,"Es una empresa con excelente ambiente de trabajo, prestaciones, crecimiento personal y laboral"
good,A typical night is emptying the freight carts by filling up the empty shelves with the freight that came in. Learning all the products in the store and the isles is good so you can help the customer find what they are looking for in a fast and convenient way. Management is understanding to the employees needs and wants they also work along side the employees on the floor.
good,"Flexible hours,lots of training,fun environment, multi task jobs from one department to another, Big on customer Service, Bonus, provided many meal team building experiences, Great with community"
good,"Overall great learning experience, will take knowledge gained into personal growth. There was plenty of room for growth and switching positions was an option if you are not content."
good,"55+ hours a week for salaried managers."
good,"* production"
good,"They were great to me while I was part time and in school.  Compensation is fair, easy enough to get on day shift.  Management is great, most take the time to get to know you and can be helpful when needed."
good,"Assisted customers with finding products, stocked shelves, and provided excellent customer service per company standards.Consistently, demonstrated the highest level of ethical conduct when dealing with customer, team members, and management."
good,"Great place to work, tons of benefits and generally friendly work environment. The problem is the wide range of shift times, it's impossible to get used to the hours unless you're one of the few employees to get consistent time slots. Also, Lot Associates should expect to feel like the bottom of the food chain."
good,It was an ok place to work was fast paced slow some days stressful management could’ve been better always expecting things that couldn’t be done to be done
good,"Being at the home depot was good . They had good pay everyone was kept busy , the manager worked with you . All associates were very helpful with each other ."
good,No job is perfect but when it comes to Home Depot they know family is a big deal and family is what we were. There’s room to move up and people get a lot of recognition for things they do.
good,As a first time job the Home Depot prepared me for the working lifestyle. I always got advice from my managers and they were helpful whenever I made a mistake
good,"There is always work that needs doing, easy to keep oneself busy with. Never a dull moment in the workplace. Customer Satisfaction is key. Nothing too demanding."
good,"Good place to work, nice people clean facility  someone always willing to answer questions or help you when you get stuck on something you may be helping a customer with"
good,Home Depot has made a lot of changes since I first started working there.  The general overall practices are not as stressful and the way of doing things has gotten better.  Also the scheduling has got better.
good,"i love home depot it is a very fun place to work and i have learned a lot. they have sharpened my skills greatly working there over the past few months, it is a great experience"
good,The Home Depot for me was an amazing experience. I learned so many new things about home improvement and the managers always took care of me when I needed help with a customer.
good,The only thing I really cared about was that Home Depot worked with my college schedule. They did that for all four years. They were always flexible and put my schooling first.
good,"Working at here is a fun and friendly environment...here has alot of room for growth and success, if your looking for something long term and fun this is where you should work"
good,"Overall, the company is a good one to work for.  The benefits offered to full time associates are very competitive.  Unfortunately, the company no longer offers health insurance to part time associates.  Pay scales are average at best.  The company culture encourages a supportive environment among the associates and each store also tries to involve itself in the community at large. "
good,"Home Depot was a quick fast paced slot and moving, stacking and loading pallet and putting merchandise in its location and my time there was enjoyable"
good,Great place to work. co workers were great to work with. All staff were friendly and helped everyone. Lots of great team work. would definitely work there again
good,Great culture. They are a people organization and embrace all culture. the work hours are flexible and they have great health benefits which can be great for you and your family
good,After 11 years of hoping for the right chance and applying for multiple positions. I finally got discouraged by the mismanagement of employees and resources available to help sales floor employees.
good,I felt like the company as a whole did care about their employees. They tend to hire within. I liked how The Home Depot paid higher than the average. On average I was happy working at The Home Depot.
good,I was just a teenager when I started working at Home Depot the start off pay was awesome. The benefits where good and l meet a lot of good people at Home Depot. This is where I really learned customer service.

good,"Enjoyed working  with the public and coworkers. Also enjoyed the hours and days that I worked. Management was also a plus. If I ever wanted another part time job, I would go back there."
good,Very good company to work for besides the fact of not having decent department heads. Would work there again if there were more motivated people staffed.
good,Manage the front end with great customer service. Making sure that the customers and associates were satisfied with everything. I open and close the registers depending on which shift I am working. I make sure there is a clean and friendly environment.
good,Home Depot provided an excellent work force and the ability to move up within the company for those qualified.  Their training programs were second to none and offered me the benefit of learning new skills while employed there.
good,"There's two main shifts 8pm to 7am(4, 10hour shifts) and 5am to 2pm (5 , 8hour shifts)  the night shift does resets and bay maintenance. Day shift general service and price changes."
good,"The Coworkers really tip the scale in the jobs favor, otherwise its pretty decent overall. The Culture is one of self improvement and project interest. My team has been fantastic, and the other teams in the store have as far as i've seen been pretty good as well!"
good,"productive and workplace "
good,"busy but relaxing"
good,With in the employees that worked here the community was nice. as a cashier when we didn't have any costumers to help people would chat about life and how they were doing. The company did a lot to make us feel special they would randomly throw us parties or give us treats to thank us for our hard work.
good,The home depot truly cares about their associates. The workplace culture is very upbeat and positive. They offer a lot of opportunities to grow and further your development.
good,This job didn't stand out but provided a good work environment and stable employment during my time. I would recommend this job position to anyone who is looking for a flexible schedule but is also willing to work nights.

good,Home Depot is a great company to work for and there is always a lot of room for advancement.  There is a family environment in the store and they offer many benefits that are unseen at other places.
good,"Great place to work in the beginning when management cared, not so much now, never enough employees to work a shift, not enough qualified employees or employers, too many lazy workers, drama, butt kissing to get advanced "
good,"I am currently a full time student, so having a flexible schedule was very important to me. They worked with the days that I was available and that was very important to me"
good,"HOME DEPOT - APPLIANCES SALES ASSOCIATE - (November 2017 - Current) - part-time"
good,"I liked The Home Depot. Great fast paced location. Customers always needed a hand so you got to learn alot about the products which is handy at all times even in regular day life. Good Benefits, good management and great co workers. I'd recommend this place"
good,"I liked the management and the people, disliked the benefits and how the would work me full time hours but never recognized me as a full time employee."
good,The Home Depot is a very skilled and fast paced work environment. You are required to be in your feet 80% of the time and be active. You come across a wide variety of workers and customers.
good,"The Home Depot is a great working environment,  you see different customers every with different questions,  working there was a good experience for me."
good,"Everyday is a  busy day at Home Depot. I go to work early and the day flies by with packing down product and customer service."
good,"honest job. easy work. standard expectations for a retail position. easy because you are just stocking, up and down. willing to be flexible if you are a student."
good,always liked everyone i worked with. my direct supervisors were almost always easy to get along with. although you could tell that our complaints about certain things were falling on deaf ears to upper management. they would change our ways of doing things for no real reason. even if we would tell them the way we were doing it was the best way and a change was'nt needed. overall i liked working there i liked my coworkers and got along with all my bosses
good,I love my job but every place has there problems. They are very strict on getting credit cards and VOA. But every holiday our manager feeds us and every year we have a company Christmas party.
good,"I enjoyed everyday at work waking up 3am in the morning and getting to work at 5am and leaving at 3:30pm. I loved the co workers and honestly if i would, id re apply to work at this place, but i want to pursue more and find more of my interest. but overall its a great place, makes you learn and experience how the real world is."
good,Great place to work at and a lot of opportunities to grow within the company. I've learned how to become a supervisor and to guide others to be their best.
good,"great place to work, everything was about working as a team and hitting goals for bonuses, everyone looks out for each other and helps whenever you need it"
good,The job certainly is not easy. You have to be able to learn about new things but once you get the hang of it then it can be pretty fun. Hours are flexible and they are always trying to help you succeed.
good,"A typical day at the home depot was very interesting because you have to be very outgoing and very polite, you have to help customers with whatever they need help with. also you will learn things from the customers and also you will teach customers things they never knew about. the hardest part would be remembering where everything is and being able to call it out to customers while helping another."
good,Se trabajo para esta compañia mas no directamente solo se construyo
good,"I've worked her for years as a merchandiser and it's a very laid back job at times and other your going from this side to that side of the store, like for sets such as Christmas or Halloween. Would recommend to the young adults or anybody at that point hours are flexible for part time"
good,"Es una empresa que cuida a su gente, excelente prestaciones de ley igual que sueldos competitivos."
good,I enjoyed working at home depot. Great enviroment although one problem with supervisor but management overall is good and fair they helped me alot when I need time for school they're understanding and helpful one of the best company to work for
good,"The position was easy going and independent, even though I collaborated with all departments to complete orders. The workload would get heavy at times, but for the most part it was easy going order picking."
good,not a bad place to work if you can get full time. a typical day is getting everyone ready and out to do general service and projects. dont really know what else to write on this
good,"I like the job  , I can learn a lot ,business is good and busy , they changed different role for me  , I like learning , but it's temporary job for me , can't stay longer , I need to find steady and full time job now ."
good,"Great place for a job but not a career to be happy with. Very few managers (assistant and GMs) were actually happy with their career choice. Luckily, my store was a top-grossing store that usually made sales plan with bonus's for the managers. Benefits were good."
good,"Great place to work if your full time. You get benefits and 401K and the possibility of overtime. As a part time employee, you don't get alot of hours. But the managers are pretty cool and laid back. Overall, a good place to work."
good,The job itself was cool the pay was 14 a hour so that was cool but the hours sucked only 20 a week but besides that everything was cool the work load was cool so nights a little harder than other but that’s everywhere
good,"day to day helping with customer service "
good,"Operated on a cash register, responsible for monies received and collected"
good,Really enjoy working with my coworkers. The team is very energetic and completes task in a timely manner. Our department manager leads by example and delegates responsibilities to associates so that they are well versed in their growth in the company.
good,Everyday was different.  Learned about all aspects of flooring. Hardest part was meeting quota every month. There was was some favoritism among mgrs and employees
good,As a sales associate it pretty much means you try drive sales to meet your goals. When met Home Depot gives all employees a bonus. You're charge of a certain department and ensure that it cleans and free of any hazards. They give opportunities to learn how to operate machinery which is always a plus to know.
good,"I've worked for The Home Depot since 2005 to present day, with an almost 4 year gap from 2012 to 2016.  I had always been part time, as I have an issue standing all day  because of physical limitations.  That hinders my advancement in the store and the company.  They try to stay pretty flexible with the schedules for the part-timers.   The company also caters different events throughout the year for the employees. Cookouts in the summertime, and subs and pizza parties for holidays.  There is an extensive benefit package for both full and part time employees both receiving paid sick/personal time and vacation time. All in all it's a decent company to work for."
good,I work on the forklift and pick up lumber put it in the rack helping other people in the area  nd I also flagged when we needed also we put lumber in all different trailers
good,"The work atmosphere is what you make of it, just like any other place of employment. Many people will complain but if you utilize all the benefits and opportunities available to you, full time or part time you can make this job worthwhile."
good,good company to work. pair programming environment. good job security. lots of sports room in the office. excellent environment to grow. ideal for someone who like challenges
good,Home Depot is an excellent company to work for. Your opportunity for growth depends on your attitude and willingness to learn. You are encourage to cross train and learn other departments.
good,I was a front end manager and there was good days and then they was bad days. I learned alot  about  everything in the store and my manager always had my back.
good,i would drive out to customers houses and go out do a measurement of their flooring for every customers everything was done through a CAD program on a Tablet that The Home Depot provided and than we would send the calculations of the measurements to the bidding department so they would give them an estimate of what it would cost each and every customer for the carpet to be installed.
good,not a lot of pay but overall good place to work with good people. management is cool and are always looking for good workers to move up in the company.
good,"It was a fun place to work and had a lot of positives but the negatives are below cost of living wages, and too political when it comes to advancement opportunities."
good,The says was long with heavy lifting and customer services. Able to assist customer/customers with a lot of materials/store items. Good opportunity to help others and with other associates.
good,"It's a great place to work at while going to school. it can be overwhelming sometimes because you don't realize how stupid people are until you work retail. I think everyone should work a retail job to give them a taste of how not to treat people and realize how easy it is to not be a terrible  person. As far as management, it varies store by store. You either have some that lead by example and others that dump work on you all day. The pay for supervisors is hard to live off of as well as being given too high of an expectation with very limited resources. if the pay was better i would've stayed but it's time to find a job that can actually pay the rent."
good,"el ambiente es bueno, los compañeros amigables. todos se ayudan."
good,"This is a friendly environment in both locations that I was in, in FL and in NY. the offered to hold and transfer my job from FL to NY when I needed to relocate"
good,"We have 3 assistant managers and one store manager, I got along with the store manager and one of the assistant store manager's but there really is no reason to have the other two."
good,This place is very fast pace the employees we are more like a family and treat people with respect it’s certain people in management that just does not act right they talk to people any kind of way the bring a lot of outside problems in the work place
good,"chiffre de travail allant de 4h a 9h."
good,A good place for individuals to develop skills and to learn. Work culture is great and there are always people willing to assist new hires. Recommended for those who are trying to enter the Financial Industry
good,Very welcoming staff and crew. The company is driven around its employees and customers to make their experience worth every minute spent in any store.
good,"A typical day at work is working with the customer service; gathering all the work that are needed to be accomplished in a timely matter. "
good,I worked a part-time position with Home Depot Ellicott City Maryland.  I was a cashier and met some really nice people at work and as customers.  Always had cook outs or luncheons.  Would have stayed but couldn’t for my own health reasons.
good,"It was a very fun place to work, I had great coworkers, every one on the over night team worked together, very great work experience, took care of the employees"
good,"a typical day at work would be coming in, greeting your coworkers before clocking in. i would learn how to better myself with stocking and helping customers. The hardest part of my job was being able to balance customers with working at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to say that you did everything you planned to do that day at work."
good,Tienen muy buen ambiente laboral y buenos beneficios
good,"Flexible hours however the time spent there can be very busy. punctuality is very important. The current store manager tends to speak to employees in a very condescending manner, however the assistant managers at this location are excellent."

good,"Quiet and pleasure work days.  Learned how work in a large scale company.  Management is clear on expectations and helps you to grow.  Culture is great, feels like your at home.  Hardest part is working in a demanding eCommerce industry.  Very much enjoy the family like atmosphere."
good,The mangers at Home Depot treated everyone the same. One of the best retail stores I worked for. Benefits were awesome and did not regret working for them. I would highly recommend them to my friends
good,"- Everyday was quite the same with helping out consumers with there needs"
good,"I can honestly say The Home Depot teach me a lot great leadership, work environment, culture. its only up to you if you are wiling to meet the expectations or just go in for a pay check. I learned a lot with them and all that knowledge has help me a lot."
good,Greeting and helping customers when they enter the store. checking Customers out when they are ready to leave. Scaning and receive payment for item purchased.

good,"The Home Depot really does care for their associates, fast advancement, great training in each department. Company profit sharing, health benefits, including medical and dental."
good,"Good place to work.  Managers were good, friendly people to work with.  It was a seasonal job; therefore, I only was able to work a few months.  I asked for a job inside, but there was nothing available."
good,Fun place to work very good place to improve also has many awesome people and the hours there are pretty good for someone that’s looking into full time or part time
good,"The job didn't pay enough money for what was required. I was the store greeter, which I did very well.They didn't want me to advance from that position because I did such a good job. There is no way to survive, working 4 hours a day 5 days a week."
good,"Great friendly place to work where the employees are placed first."
good,"Designing and implementing a strategic sales plan that expands customer base and ensure it's strong presence. Managing recruiting, coaching and perfor,"
good,If you're just starting out it's a great place to learn the ropes and see what you can deal with and what you need to work on. But the pay is minimal and the hours and perks aren't competitive.
good,"When I was hired on, this store was great, but we're severely understaffed now and it's hard to enjoy my job like I used to. Front End management has changed quite a few times, but the heads now are lovely people, and the other front end workers are great to be around too. Everyone comes into work and helps customers the best that they can despite their hardships."

good,"It’s a good place to work for part time stay at home parents."
good,I worked selling Windows and doors to contractors and home owners helping them custom build what they needed great customer service was definitely needed to work my position you had to work part time for the first ninety days before full time
good,The most important objective is to put the customer first. the company train you on the designated department and if ask you can get training on register or other departments. Management try to show they care for the employee.
good,Home Depot is a great part time job but not a good full time job. You really don’t receive the proper training but you will easily get written up for things you were never taught.
good,In Puerto Rico this company hire only temporary employees for 4 months and then don't renew contract and hire another group of people. I don't undersand why they cant just hire and keep the employees.
good,Home depot is a great company to work for. The people are amazing and very professional and fun to be around which makes for a great work environment.
good,I was in charge of distributing merchandise to all departments in a timely manner and packing down my dept. to fill in merchandise and material handling management at the time was great and always made work and enjoyable
good,It's a good place to work. Co-employees are fun to work with. Good benefits and nice working environment.You get profit sharing every quarter and there is room for growth and developent.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers.  Contractors come in several times a day and you can joke and say this feels like dejavue.  We also have a few customers that can bring in their furry friends and it is allowed.
good,"Assisted customers with find items in the store and returns. "
good,"Home Depot is an amazing employer for career advancement, they often promote from within and always reward good work ethic. Working for them was a positive and beneficial experience, they are flexible with scheduling and the pay is not too bad."

good,The job was super fun but just had to better myself. They gave you many different opportunities and different levels of management were cool to work with.
good,Working both as a cashier and a Vault Assistant was a challenge. Since both were dealing with cash and then balancing the daily sales.  Management was very workable with scheduling issue if needed.
good,"Amazing people to build a great comunity and working environment. I learned many things at Home Depot one was responsibility , how to get along with a team full of different culture."
good,Helped in the plumbing department answering questions for guest that would come in. I sometime also helped in lumber. I would also help stock shelves as well.
good,A typical day at work is 8 hours of preventing theft and fraud internally and externally. There is a low ceiling for Asset Protection Specialists. The hardest part of the job was too many policy changes. The best part of the job was preventing theft.
good,Learned things i've never thought i would ever get into learning. Job can be challenging but it was also rewarding at the end when helping customers with complicated orders or finding a solution to their problems.
good,"The Home Depot is an overwhelmingly positive place to work, and they make a point of being that way. Management is always friendly and willing to help, and the company does plenty to make employees feel appreciated and taken care of. They offer full time benefits as well as part time benefits, and competitive rewards programs. "
good,"Short hours, but the work, team members were great and made the nights go by faster, over night stocking sometimes gets tiring but with my team there it made everything go by fast"
good,Life working for Home Depot is fast pace and there is always things to keep busy doing. The hours can be better and the pay but overall the athomphere is good people and great customers that are DIY. We do our best to show them how to complete projects on your own... 👍🏼 Fun communicating with different people and solving their problems.😄
good,"good company to work for. On the average day, you would clock in, listen to the morning meeting and get start working. This job was good and it is a great place,"
good,"Overall, I really enjoyed my time at Home Depot. I worked on the MET team and our hours were Mon-Fri 5am-1pm. The store employees were jealous because they most often had to work weekends. I enjoyed working with that group and I made many friends there."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at The Home Depot, I have interests in another career field, which is my reason for wanting to leave. This company has been good to me and is a good place to work if you like to work with others and learn a lot about home improvement as well."
good,"The staff and helping customers made my day, everyday. The variety of different tasks for the day was stimulating a pleasure to do. The hours we're that consistent, but the pay made up for it, which, in itself wasn't that impressive either, but the quality of work kept me around. Each day had it's own joys and opportunities to learn and grow as a person and also in the customer service industry. I definitely recommend anyone that wants a change and a chance to work with a fun and driven team."
good,"Working at home depot was fun, I like that I was able to stay busy at work so the time went by faster. There was a lot of people working there so it stayed interesting. If it had more consistent hours I probably would have stayed."
good,"Got the hours I wanted, worked as much as I wanted and when i needed less hours they reduced my work week, everyone is nice and helps out, pay is great."
good,"Good and face paced job, everyone around was always willing to help if you had question. There was a lot of favoritism though. Overall I would recommend this job."
good,"#1 home improvement retailer.   If you like to help people, then you will be ok here.   Otherwise go find a warehouse job.   Very competitive and fast paced."
good,"It gets very busy, especially on the weekends. Environment is not too healthy, as you are exposed to dust and chemicals daily. Good coworkers. You get food and bonus checks every once in while."
good,"Top management in my store is excellent. Department heads vary and some are great, others not so good. It depends on what department you work in. A normal day at work as a cashier is checking customers out, giving the veteran discount, checking that store credit is in the person's name who is using it, looking up items that do not have bar codes, answering questions. directing customers to the aisle in the store where a product is located, asking if customers would like to sign up for a Home Depot credit card. The hardest part of this job is dealing with difficult customers or rude customers, trying to find barcodes for some items in the online cashier look up system. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people, interacting with them, and learning about products from the customer such as what project they are doing or what they are going to use their items on. One family bought a bunch of moving boxes and they were going to build an indoor fort/playhouse for their kids. The kid's workshop is fun and interesting to see what they make. The culture varies and there are all different types of people working there from different backgrounds and the customers are very different. Many different countries represented from where people are from and they speak different languages. I had 2 men speaking Greek and I asked them what language it was as it was not familiar to me.Lots of active duty military and veterans. Somebody always has a story to tell and I find the customers very interesting."
good,It was an okay experience believe a team would of been better with the management. Although the team members and the employees were hard workig there were no direction from the higher ups
good,i liked the work environment customers were friendly i got my breaks and lunches as promised. management lacked compassion at times to people with disablities
good,Loved working here a great employee environment. Was responsible for the lot and assisting customers in product load outs. Customers were friendly and would say the same for my co-workers. Overall a great place to work at.
good,"Its an ok job, i mean you dont get paid well for what you do and while there is an opportunity for advancement, most people still need to work a second job."
good,"Great leadership team that wants to promote talent"
good,"Very open-minded, high energy, fast paced environment, competitive. Many different shifts available as well as departments to work in. Opportunities for career advancements"
good,"Daily routine would be monitoring the paint department. It was decent, good work crew. The only thing that it would make it better, would be a better pay."
good,work was hard everyday no time really to rest had to have work done quick and on time manger would watch over you the hole time I didn't like they didn't have enough works
good,"I learned something new at the home depot everyday. I enjoyed working at home depot and loved my customers. Great place to work, if your a student or for part timre work."
good,The pay sucks here . Such a big company should consider paying employees more money to retain them. Instead of having to rehire mor people to fill the void and spen a lot of money training them.
good,"great environment work area, team work, proactive everyday, the hardest part is unloading a big truck on summer time, the most enjoyable is unload truck and stocking store"
good,"retail position, cashier , customer service, nothing special about the job...it was ok, I don't want to work retail and that is why I left.  nothing really  negative to say"
good,Definitely a great set of people you work with. Very much into helping the community. Catered lunches during the holidays. Some management was great to talk to others would ignore you.
good,I started out part time and was quickly promoted to full time because I made my wishes known and worked hard. The management staff is amazing and are really focused on helping the associates feel good about working there.
good,Apart of MET Team and it was really laid back and relaxed. Great people to work with. Had fun on the job because of the people working there. Great place to work!
good,Fun place to work with good people. Good pay overall good place. Very helpful co workers and managements. Provided anything  needed while working. i would recommend this work place to a friend.
good,"Check in, say hello to other co-workers, proceed to locker and put the Apron on...Clock in"
good,i learned alot of new skills working there. great coworkers and knowlegable supervision. i feel that the customer service in this store is much better than other stores i have shopped at.
good,"You have the opportunity to make what you want of this job.  It can be a part time job, or you can make this a career and grow within the company through hard work and dedication."
good,Could have been better. People were fire frequently. Bosses weren't very open minded. Fired a lady who worked with them for 3 years because her car broke down and she missed three days.
good,"Fast-paced warehouse environment"
good,"Managers treat every employee like a family member, they do fun events every quarter so it gives their employees a reason to enjoy the workplace, if you have any problems they are quick to help out no matter what it may be"
good,"Working as a cashier, the role is very important you have to make sure the customer found everything they were looking for. Always smile and have a positive attitude. "
good,"Enjoyed working at Home Depot it was kinda fun but yet heard work. I also worked in the garden shop, and I enjoyed  helping people that had questions about the merchandise we sold."
good,The Merchandising Execution Team (night shift) is a really fun job. It's new and challenging every night. Its too bad the pay is beyond underwhelming.
good,Home Depot is a good company to work for. They provide great insurance and benefits. Promotion changes are available there and hard works makes it easier for you to move up.
good,its a great place to work at u have great bosses and the are always checking on you to see if you are alright cause at the home depot its like a second family cause we look out for each other.
good,Fun place to work. Good team to work with. The only problem is the work schedule. Never know what days your working and hours. I had a regular schedule when I worked there.
good,The Home Depot is a good place to work since it offers so many areas of opportunity.  You can work in corporate in many of the departments or within the store in various departments as well.
good,Great experience working with different type of customers helping with their home improvement needs. Great team that help you learn and are patient. Great place to work.
good,A typical day is pretty lenient there is always something to do and the people are always fun to talk to. I learned a lot about home day's and how to's and over all a better undertanding of things that need to be fixed and installed in common households.
good,I was working here I learned how to reset for seasonal reset I had to stock all products onto the shelf in reorder things they need that wasn't there etc.
good,"Like any retail job the hours can be inconsistent. They focus very heavily on Customer Service and Employee satisfaction. They utilize a Servant Leadership style with what they call a reverse pyramid model. Customers and Associates are at the majority of the focus then management then corporate. Overall the Company is great to work for, as long as you are willing to work hard and continually do more you can grow as high as you want with the company. Most managers started out as lot attendants or cashiers."
good,Helped me get through college. Many different departments and chances for advancement. The stores offer many employment opportunities. Easy place to advance.
good,My typical work day started off buy cleaning my department and making sure that it was in safe working and shopping conditions. As my day progressed I had the duty too maintain my department and provide costumers with information that would be of help too their shopping experience.

good,"easy performing tasks to help make the day go by faster, friendly associates available to help others out, good amount of breaks to help make work easy"
good,"No stress environment, minimum goals for credit card sign ups in appliances- otherwise no pressure for sales which was nice. Have a 'homer kitchen' in the breakroom for when payday is short and employees need help getting something to eat."
good,"I've been with the company for over 17 years, and have been a Department Supervisor for over 8 of those. Some of the management teams that I've worked under have been absolutely great, and others, not so much. I've watched others while I've been at my store, and those that have worked hard, and with a good work ethic, have moved from PT to FT, been promoted from associate to DS/DH, or even higher. Hard work will get you where you want to go... IF you have the right management team. Take a read on your Assistant managers and Department Supervisors. Are they who they seem to be? Do they follow up words with actions? If so, you're on the right side, and you can go places. During the recession of 2008 and on, people would ask me how my day was going... I would answer ""I've still got a job, many do not, and I have a roof over my head and food in my stomach, I'm having a great day"". How you look at a place depends on your situation. Job security has been good for me, and I have treated the company right. There are times when I feel we are chasing our tail, much like a dog. The corporate directive is to do ""this"". Well, you know for a fact that ""this"" has been tried before, multiple times, but... It's their directive, and we do what we're told, even after they change the word from ""this"" to ""that"". It's the same thing, but it's a job."
good,The Home Depot fosters a team environment. It is a great place to learn about building materials as well as retail sales. You interact closely with DIY and professional customers.
good,"This is a good job to get successfully complete jobs outside of work to home, whether that was working on a contract building or to working at home doing kitchen and bath works."
good,"Très bonne entreprise, mais salaire peut compétitif"
good,"Home Depot was a good job, they helped me understand the aspect of selling which wS AMAZIN, and it has furthered my ideas in the future with my life.."
good,Pretty good place to work. I have learned about new products. Not a place to work for. I got along with others. gained customer service experience. I learned a lot.
good,"A lot of downtime and not a high demanding job. Wanted to be more productive with my time while at work, not a competitive job. Most customers wanted that time to shop."
good,I really enjoy working at The Home Depot. Everyone is very nice and always helpful. The managers work with you when needed and co-workers were pleasant.
good,"The people you work with are great, they are friendly. The management staff is easy to get along with and easy to go to. Lots of friendly customers. Always on your feet and moving constantly."
good,"Cons"
good,"Although dealing with customers at a place like this is an acquired taste, the coworkers are almost entirely helpful and great to be around. This is absolutely a place to work at if you're looking to learn while working."
good,"The pace varied from day to day."
good,The Home Depot is a great company to work for they offer alot of perks and benefits. Home Depot is a great place to learn about house/home improvement projects .they offer DIY programs
good,I worked in the flooring and garden departments. Flooring was ok but I wasn't much of a seller but garden was amazing. When the sun was out it was always so nice and it made working outside so much better.
good,The work culture is great here. The care for the customers and employees can be seen on a daily basis. I would definitely recommend The Home Depot to someone looking for a new career
good,Very busy place to work. Able to learn about many products used in the market place. management team worked hard right along side of the hourly associates. Hard to keep store organized with so many customers in and out; but it was great to be able to help so many people with their purchases.
good,"buen ambiente laboral"
good,good place to work. excellent for a first job for teens and young adults now starting off in the work environment. Benefits are good and work advancement are a big possibility
good,"*Some days were slow, some were long"
good,"I have started as a garden associate, move to the greeter position. My last position was paint associate before i start working for lowes that offers a higher pay"
good,"The Home Depot has provided me the opportunity to explore sales, retail management, inventory management, and customer service-type situations of a nature far different from my teaching and church ministry days.  Although the hourly wages could be improved and the hours for part-time employees increased, not to mention the available benefits for part-timers, the sales associate position is one that can be learned and improved on as time and experience allow."
good,none the job is a great job but just like any other job it has its ups and downs. the managers are great and some of them do try to work with you and understand your needs
good,to start off your day you would have a short meeting you would also check the overhead aisles for safety issues.You would then do your department downstocking  list
good,"Not a bad place to earn a little extra, but if your trying to move up it's is a cut throat. You need to know someone to move on up and raises are based on who you are if your liked and there's favoritism then you get a raise and maybe a created title to go with it, if your not to popular than you get the store policy on raises explained to you on how they give rasies and then have to wait yet another year or two. Another place no one wants to train you because then you might do their job better so your on your own."
good,"The hours for this job are 5 am to 2 pm, there was no time for anything else during the day. Rules constantly changing and the management always felt the need to blame others for things he was clearly responsible for."
good,Good place but has no financial future.  Has growth opportunities but does not encourage growth.  Would like to see more management opportunities in management.  Not enough monetary enticement for future employment.
good,"As a cashier, you have your fast-paced days and your low-paced days. When there are many customers, you have to work quickly so people won't get irritated waiting. However, it is a fun place because you get to meet many people and everyone helps each other when needed."
good,Home Depot is a great place to learn the corporate environment. They really promote employee growth and learning. They offer flexibility and a great work environment
good,"Never a dull moment, tons of cross training, management is usually very adept at their jobs, lots of room for advancement/department shifts, performance rewards, decent coverage for sick days, usually not a problem to swap shifts, great place, really enjoyed working here."
good,"Enjoy working here. Get to meet a lot of new people from all over the world... It's a great place to work for, just not enough hours for me. Management is good.. they really look out for their employees."
good,I think Home Depot is a good place to start out as a career and basically learn a new experience a Home Depot has a good health plan good benefits that come along with it as well
good,I would say that the distribution for home depot is a very laid out job. Meaning that if you go to work and work you will be perfectly fine! Its Great
good,"This was honestly a pretty good first job. Starting out my very first job with $10 an hour was amazing, and when I left it was $11. The training is very good, but it really is a job you fully adapt to by doing it hands on. It's a little overwhelming in the beginning. There's a lot you need to know as a cashier that you don't expect to have to know. But all the cashiers were so, so helpful and never made you feel like you couldn't ask for help. I started working here right before Hurricane Harvey hit and after it did we received really great bonuses for about 3 months. Then, about a year or so later I started asking about going full time. At first I was working part time because I wanted to go to school, but changed my mind and wanted to just work and save up some more. They told me they weren't really looking for full time, but they were still hiring cashiers. I also didn't like how the full time workers didn't have a set schedule.Then I learned a lot of peoples hours were starting to get lower and lower, mines included. I tried to stick it out a little bit more, but requested time off for a Thanksgiving family trip. They denied my time off, and I quickly found a small temp. job and left the store. It was honestly not a bad first job, but towards the end I could see everyone and everything starting to go downhill so I needed out. Also, for females out there, you will get hit on. By many old guys. It happened to me and so many of my female co-workers. Older guys wanting to ask you out, older guys wanting to be your sugar daddy and take you to nice places. You'd be surprised by"
good,"Working at Home Depot definately depends on you, there’s room for improvement and bonuses are available, just go to work and adhere to organizational policies and ensure your customers are satisfied and the sky is the limit"
good,My biggest regret was leaving this place for more money. The culture was great. The benefits were pretty good and the pay was decent for the job that you did.
good,The only thing I don't like are the hours constantly change from week to week.  One day you may start at 6 a.m. and the next 6 p.m.  It's difficult to plan anything.
good,I really enjoy my time at Home Depot one of the best job I ever had definitely would recommend to a friend we was great on team work cleanness and overall a great working environment
good,"Entraba muy pronto en la manana."
good,"Fast-paced, fun environment with room to share your ideas.  There is a clear vision for the future of the company and the leaders are driven to achieve the vision."
good,"Lifting of heavy freight can become quite back breaking and repetitive stress can become painful. Keeping shelves stocked so customers can find what they need is rewarding, however"
good,I loved working here. Just wished they had more fulltime positions instead of rotating outpart time temp workers. Great benefits and can make a GREAT resume filler.
good,"lovely company, lovely people, lovely customers. i enjoyed working with all of the staff, they was wonderful, i mean they was really great working with them"
good,"I truly enjoyed my time working at the Home Depot. Although their were times that management was poor, it was the employees that made it worth it. I learned so many home improvements and along with that I learned that delivering customer service gives one pride. The bonuses are always a plus but also it is a great place for someone young to start."
good,"a typical day will start by clocking in and going straight to returns. "
good,It was a really nice place to work. You got to meet different people and learn lot about home improvements among other things. They do believe in promoting within the company first.
good,"you basically had a list of projects to do for the day, then once you got done with that you helped other team members achieve their list. I learned about different products the THD sells which are great products. Parts of management could be on the floor more frequent, ready to assist customers. Great place to work at. Most people did their jobs correctly, but the ones that didn't should of been held accountable for. Meeting people was great."
good,"Very fast paced place with lots to learn, friendly customers, and great vendors and associates."
good,"Excelente clima de trabajo y cultura de valores, apoyo e importancia por los trabajadores que estan ahi y vivencias de convivios para fortalecer el crecimiento laboral."
good,Worked here while going to school. Good job at the time with excellent benefits. However the same benefits are not offered at this time and the work environment had become stressful
good,Fun place to work. Staff was very friendly. Quick and easy job to learn.  Would have stayed but there was an accident with my car that caused me to leave because I no longer had a way of getting to work
good,I have no opinion. II just started there. Other than not getting enough hours it seems just fine. I don't have a problem with home depot but I'm not very happy with Indeed.com for making me write this review.
good,"I came too work and performed customer service to the best of my ability, we had a team of merchandisers that handled specific jobs/duties in the store relating to price changes, stocking, building and setting up displays..."
good,"This job is perfect for bringing in extra cash, working through school, or better benefits. I probably won't recommend wanting to move up in the company. it's added un-necessary stress."
good,you meet a lot of new people all the workers there are like family. I like that its pet friendly. The managers always get things done. You start to like you job more and more every single day.
good,Home Depot Freight/ Receiving is fast pace but relaxed and fun work environment. Management is fair and the employees are welcoming and easy to get along with.
good,I am part time would like more hours. People I work with are nice to me. They offer courses on the computer to learn new departments. I have a job coach and she helps me through some of the hardest part of my job. Friendly atmosphere.
good,I loved the work environment that was created by the store manager with the help of all his staff. we are a Fast past place. great people made for even better team work.
good,I would reccomend this job to anybody looking for a start to their working career. It's a fast paced environment with hard working employees that will help you along the way.
good,Great job to move up in the company. pays well and get annual raises. they hold a lot of store events and parties for employees. fun work place and great people.
good,"Working in customer service , i learned patience, understanding , commitment, dedication , and to always remain polite at all times . i didnt stay long to get a full better experience but the experience i have im greatful for"
good,The Home Depot is a great company to work for. They offer great benefits and additional discounts for various vendors. The company respects its employees and encourages volunteerism.
good,"Overall a good company to work for, pay is lacking for the work required but the opportunity for advancement is promising and most associates are fun to work with. Flexible schedules for students are available. Vacation hours for part-time associates are also available."
good,If you have no degree or don't plan on furthering education. There is room for advancement good benefits. If you want better you must do better. There IS opportunity also many locations.
good,"Great place to work if you are a student or looking for part time employment. Willing to work around your needs and schedule when needed, which is hard to find within many stores or plants."
good,"I enjoyed working here. There wasn't any conflict other than getting less hours than needed, which lead to a second part time job. Everything else here was great."
good,This job was very enjoyable. Pro would include the interaction with many people. Con would be the lack of hours. Overall experience was positive and have never regretted a single day working there.
good,"I enjoy company willingness to help an associates and all the amazing benefits n in store events as well as the community service, no negative every company has its flaws."
good,No a bad place very fast paced. Some of the managers were amazing. Ping pong tables. Basket ball hoops. Parties for major holidays. The vision insurance was really good
good,For anyone who wanted a real good job and willing to put real work in.i honestly think that they should work on their scheduling though. Honestly. Nice.
good,great place to work. helping the customers succeed in what the came there for. it is good to assist anyone that needs help in what they plan on doing. It is the greatest place to work
good,"Atypical work day could be hard or simple, its what you make it at the end of the day. Learning this job threw the academy under duress.  Management has its moments and its regulations. All nationalities are on this job. The hardest thing about this job is the population of bd of ed. The enjoyable part of this job is the summer months working short hours and enjoying time off."
good,"Being a specialist you work the busy parts of the day 8-5, 9-6, or 10-7. It all depends on the store location. I enjoyed learning at a fast past so I was able to understand how to sale good, better, best of so many different products. This position also gives you the opportunity to get in front of a computer  make outbound phones calls while also getting some inbound. If left on the department alone it may get a little crazy."
good,"Provide an excellent customer experience by"
good,"Home Depot is an interesting place of employment. You can look to always stay busy and you are welcome to assist customers. Always have something to stock, always staying busy."
good,Friendly team environment. We work hard and have fun at the same time. Also a great place to work if you're looking for a successful retail career. Easy
good,the days were average.learned to hone my social skills.management was very poor.the culture was very diverse.hardest part of the job was angry customers
good,"I was part of the freight team, and everybody did something to contribute. There was always something to do even if there was no trucks that day. We had an important role because if we didn't do our jobs, what would the sales associates send."
good,"Good place to work good morals all around, alot of good people work here, the only thing I didnt like the company was caring about the employees when I first started loved the job then it all switched over to them getting more and more numbers squeezing everything little bit out of their associates"
good,"Was a great job.  The branch of the landscape supply store went out of business so the job was no long available.  The people I worked with were great, the customers were loyal.  If that branch was still around, I was for sure recommend it.  Great memories and great experiences."
good,Good Benefits. Low pay rate. this was a good job its just that they moved me through different Dept. and i never had a change in rate per hour i was working in the end for the overnight crew from 10:30pm -7:00am 4-5 days a week and was still getting paid as a cashier!
good,"I enjoyed working there, I built a amazing client list, I loved my customers and my relationships with my coworkers, the hours where great and they will work with you if anything came up."
good,"busy days, long weekends and some overnights."
good,I love working here everyone there is very helpful and is willing to help the ones that are in need and will always make sure that you have a positive work experience for that day.
good,i like my job i like working with my co workers we work together as a  team to get the job done and the supervisors are great and let no they recognize our hard work
good,"I worked at the home depot for a little more than a year, one store in Austin which I originally applied to, and a store I transferred to in Killeen after moving. My experiences with the first store varied with customers, workers and managers. The workplace flow was fast paced and very straight forward for the most part, but not always so consistent depending on the managers and workers who were scheduled on a given day. You could easily get in the hang of the positions in the store do to our weekly video training, but that didn't come to every worker so well, as management would  hardly ever take measures into their own hands when it came to going over some of the more important or complex procedures with their associates. while my work experience was over all pretty good at both locations, that didn't come with any drawbacks. Since at the time I was a minor while working at both stores I found myself getting under-looked and noticed failure of the management recognizing my efforts as an associate which lead me to become somewhat discouraged. Overall, if I could work in a workplace like the two stores with the same atmosphere I definitely would, just with some minor changes. It truly never felt like I was working with  just co-workers, but instead it felt like real teammates."
good,A basic work day was unloading a truck. Stocking shelves with products. Then placing overstock in overhead compartments. While doing this I learned how to operate a stand up forklift and also an order picker. I learned this with the help of great management and structure.
good,"I loved working at Home Depot, i knew quite a few regular customers, loved to see them. The store was a good place to work, some of the management were a bit hard to deal with, but i would go back in a heartbeat."
good,Overall I would say that the home depot is a great place to work. I was there for 6 years and although some management seems incompetent there are others that make up for it.
good,The only reason for leaving was a job closer to home. The company offered a lot of benefits and perks. You were able to get a lot of overtime during the holiday season which was a big plus.
good,"Good place to work, good people, challenging but fun, when you move up the chain they mostly hire from within.  Work becomes a lot more challenging and a lot more responsibility."
good,i felt really god while working for home depot. made a lot of friends. every shift went by easy with talking to people while cruising the warehouse. I'd work for them again.
good,A great place to work. Everyone is friendly and tries to work together the best of their ability. You are recognized for many things you do right. Great Company to work for.
good,"PROS;"

good,"I worked for HD for almost 10years! I enjoyed my job(s) and especially working with an excellent crew of great people!! I learned so much about providing excellent Customer Service!! When it comes to working for HD the biggest opportunity with them is you can advance...if you are a reliable, hard-working and want to climb the corporate ladder...they will back you! Negatives...walking that cold concrete floor 8hrs a day! Hard to get Full time!"
good,Not a bad Place for someone in High School or College.  Get to learn a lot about what goes into the construction and remodeling of real estate and repairing miscellaneous household items.
good,"Time seems to fly by because I am always busy, either unloading truck or putting away stock. My co workers are ""entertaining"" and easy to talk to. Customer basically already know what they want and need. they just need to be pointed in the right direction."
good,"I love this job very much. It was my first job and it was A great experience with somewhat good pay. They were fair, helpful and very friendly people to work with."
good,I loved working at Home Depot. The team was great and friendly. Everyone worked together and made the work easy. I got raises every few months and the awards for good work are well worth the effort.
good,Great place to work however hours are long and people do not appreciate what you have to offer as a manager. Multiple times strethcing yourself thin will not get you any advancement and it is not valued.
good,Was a good place to work if you're just getting by. may be a little rough the first few weeks but eventually it will get better.They have flexible ours but not enough hours to live on your own.
good,you are going to deal with the public a lot. it was easier for me because i was well versed in home improvement. lots of experience coming in. good part time job and the employee training is actually helpful and insightful.
good,"Home Depot taught me how to provide superior customer service on a consistent basis! I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company for 10 years."

good,Learned to work with a diverse group of people and helped the community with projects. Excellent associates willing to go above the norm to help customers.
good,"You called vendors, customers, stores, other associates to help the customers' problems and solve all quickly as possible. You are a cashier, place orders, check on orders, help customers all day. Sometimes the associate is asked to assemble items. Other times you can assist your associates in other departments."
good,"Nice place to work, good management. just hard to make a living. The call center is really a good environment but I need to make more money to survive."
good,"the home depot was a nice place to work. the people was great,and managers was nice. it was a fast pace job. the only thing wrong was it was only a part time job, not full time."
good,"Loved my time with this company! You work hard, but it is very rewarding! I loved being able to help people solve their home improvement dilemmas and have the autonomy to truly make a difference for people. Had life not taken me in a different direction, I would still be working for them."
good,"This company provided a great wage and allowed you to advance with the company.  Great management team, great schedule to work and a good atmosphere. Everyone seemed to help when needed, which made it a great place to work."

good,"Very interesting and informative job, learned a whole lot and was glad to have experienced such a place. the schedule was flexible and for the most part customers were great."
good,Provided top quality service to customers while ensuring merchandise was properly placed and stocked on shelves and the store area was always kept clean.
good,"Never worked in such a fast paced warehouse before, and its a very strenuous job. Very disciplined job that had the employess stretching before the shift even started."
good,"The atmosphere was nice at The Home Depot, everyone wore a smile and management was friendly. There is a lot of information to learn from this company."
good,"Home Depot has a continuous improvement focus that encourages change.  It is customer oriented, but with a culture that encourages individual development, recognition, training, and fun."
good,"This is a good place to work for those who are starting their job search for the first time.  Also good for those individuals who are retired and need extra income or want to do something.  Great job for college kids and just in general those seeking temp work or extra money for the holidays.  Flexible work schedule, pay benefits and vacation time with paid days off.  Offers discounts for associates online and team atmosphere."
good,Home Depot is pretty self explanatory. The hardest part about the job is memorizing where products are located and knowing what tools will be needed. Besides that it lots of busy work and helping customers
good,General customer services. Cash register. Stock handling and relocating.  A lot of standing and walking. Worked very few hours every week. Not worth staying for the pay.
good,"Great place to work. Management respect the employees. I enjoy being able to help customers. Company works with your scheduling needs. A typical work day would be find a hole, fill a hole. This mean making sure the shelves are stocked for the customers. Always ask the customers can you help them find what they need, or are they finding everything ok."
good,"Overall I liked working at Home Depot. I worked overnights, which works perfectly with my schedule at the time. I would still be there if I had not received a better offer."
good,"Home Depot is all business You work your shift, helping customers, and when not helping customers, you are re=stocking shelves. In this manner you are busy all the time till your shift ends..Supervisors never bother you if you know your business."
good,"I don't think there never was a typical day at home Depot They always would move me to were they were short handed. witch i did enjoy. "
good,"I enjoyed helping and communicating with customers.I enjoyed my co-workers,they played a major part in helping me concerning *on the job training*.It was a delightful experience."
good,I learned a lot just by helping people look for what they where looking for in the store. Employees help a lot with things your not understanding. They have employee holiday celebration and end of quarter celebrations. They give out awards for example employee of the month. cashier of the month and many more.
good,"Working for the Home Depot can be whatever you want it to be. Whether you are looking for something for the summer, for 7 years, or for 30 years. Advancement withing the company is possible, with hard work, dedication, and willingness to learn and go above expectations. Most of the District level management started around the same level I started at. And while The Home Depot may not have the highest wages right off the bat, they make up for it with benefits, such as giving all associates bonuses off of Sales vs. Sales Plan."
good,"The majority of co-workers and management were great. Mostly fast paced days, but still able to have fun and connect with customers. Overall a great place."
good,I have worked for the company numerous times at multiple stores in different positions up to training for an assistant manager position. Some of the mentality you will encounter is male driven business but a woman who applies herself can succeed. Depending on the management is what makes the job. I met and exceeded expectations every time and learned as much as I could at each role I had in the company. Advancement is there given you put yourself up in front of those who will promote you or do the hiring.
good,Home depot was a store that I had no knowledge of when I got the job so had to learned new things. training was great and very informational for the job. good management and staff had been with this company for a long time. that help new employee.

good,I have enjoyed working at the Home Depot for the last three years however I feel with my skill set and past experience I am ready to move on to move on to next endeavor that more challenges me.
good,It's a great place to work at. I've been here for two years.  I'm glad I got the chance to work for them because I learned something new. It's the first job I ever had in my whole life. Being a cashier isn't so bad. I love to help each and every customer.
good,Coworkers for the most part are really great and other then the problem customers is not a bad place to work. Sometimes though it feels as if im expected to do a little too much.
good,There is constant training from the moment you start. The work environment is very pleasant and there are constant development opportunities which motivate to stay there. Constant activities and incentives.
good,"Company was driven by sales and customer service.  Typical retail hours, long and demanding.  Great opportunity to grow and learn. Downside is the demanding work load and changing work shifts."
good,working at home depot was a very challenging job because i had no experience in my department but with the help of my co worker is was able to learned the tasks i needed to know.

good,"Bay maintenance, shelf sequencing, and price changes, build displays and key machine. Electric ladder to retrieve product from over-head bays. Inventory of various departments, customer service. Team work with communication skills, time management & organizing skills."

good,"Good people to worked with. Very supportive management, instilling a culture of 'customer first' to every employees - rewards employees for hardwork. Working at night shift (9pm to 5:30am) is a challenge maybe because I haven't worked in the graveyard shift for the longest time."

good,Good atmosphere and nice workers. They feed you often and are always there to answer questions. You learn about different projects and what stuff is for.
good,The Tool Tech position requires that one be highly self motivated and capable of diagnosing and solving various problems throughout the work day. For general associates most will be required to work flexible shifts Monday -Sunday. If your interested in a career in retail then Home Depot would be a great place for you with opportunity for advancement.
good,"Home depot is great to work at, you get good pay and benefits. The job is fairly easy and fast paced but you get decent breaks for food and rest. My only grievance is with the coworkers, some of who were less than desirable to work with but it doesn't affect your job performance"
good,I loved this job. This is probably the only job I've ever had where I could say that truthfully. Granted I did not enjoy the management so much but going to work each day was actually enjoyable.
good,"Se preocupan por ti y lo que pasa a tu alrededor, se te capacita minimo 4 horas al mes por lo cual puedes aprender muchas mas cosas al entrar a esta empresa."
good,"Same as above - very good company to work for - unfortunately, District team dictates a lot of the mid-guided directives. Spent 15 years with company, not all bad, just when the district team changed."
good,"Great Company, with many opportunities especially if you are willing to relocate. Company offers training and always looks out for the associates beat interest."
good,The Home Depot has a great training program and availability to grow with the company. The compensation is competitive and fair for what you want to get out of it. The benefits all around are outstanding.
good,"Its been a while since i have work there, however I do remember the Managers were great and so were my coworkers.  I personally was able to advance is positions quickly,  and many employees are still there 13 years later.  This place seems to be ideal as a  long term option if you have the freedom to work day or night.  I do know that  the CEO did change while i was there and I cant really speak for the way things are running there these days.  They  are still around, even with great competition out there, that says alot."
good,"- Enjoyed working at home depot"
good,"great place to work, good pay.job security.room for advancement if dedicated.co workers are supportive and helpful.management is approachable for the most part.there are incentives for a job well done."
good,The Home Depot is a great place to build a career. You can move up in the company fairly easily with the right training. They have plenty of perks and bonuses.
good,Good place to work. Supervisors are very helpful. Customers are outstanding. Associates from other departments are very helpful. Often celebrates employees with free lunches or employees bring in surprise dishes to share for low prices and money is donated to the employee Christmas fund.
good,"My time at Home Depot was interesting to say the least, the people you run Into are definitely what’s most stressful about working there. Other than that it’s a great place to work and the atmosphere there is incredible"
good,"All the employees were always ready to give a helping hand to a newie.  The work was sometimes difficult, especially pulling large online orders for customers for delivery."
good,"Great for learning home renovation. Hands on job training with Forklift and other warehouse equipment. Great benefits, friendly work environment and fair pay."
good,I loved working at The Home Depot. I had great coworkers and great managers. The only con was the low pay. It was a fast paced work environment but with the pay being as low as it was it left employees unsatisfied.
good,"From my experience with the Home Depot I learned how to build lasting relationships with my customers and colleagues, as well as how to be a team leader. I was given the opportunity to learn more about kitchen and bath and other areas of work."
good,We had a casual dress code. Enjoyed meeting new people and helping the customers. We were given promotions after taking classes to get certified. Everyone always helped each department as needed.
good,I liked working at Home Depot because it was a good learning experience for me. You also worked with good people that were willing to work as a team and help.
good,Stable work environment with a strong staff relationship. Large focus on customer service and department knowledge. The culture is diverse and the company encourages advancement opportunities.
good,"Awesome staff, friendly.  Would recomment anyone to work for Home depot even thought there is no union.  Room for advancement and recognition for excellence."
good,This was a great place to work.  The people were fun the management team was very invested in the employees and recognized when someone did good work and rewarded them.
good,"My overall experience with Home Depot was very positive.  This is an environment in which performance is the only currency.  Most associates who remain for any serious period of time understand this and work, both individually and collaboratively to accomplish the core goals of the organization.  Most of the Management staff were focused on getting product to customers, and helping or directing associates in whatever was required to accomplish this."
good,People i work with are easy to get along. They train me things i need to know about. The company really give credit to their workers. Just a good place to be
good,Family atmosphere with friendly associates that ready and willing to help every customer and teach other associates.  Most days are very busy and face paced.
good,"i liked the job just wasnt enough hours, and the back room was very hot but even with that being said i enjoyed working there just wish it was a full time position"
good,The people were nice to work with and I enjoyed getting to know regulars. Working with the order system along with the customers on the phone can sometimes mangle communication.
good,"Operations Supervisor"
good,"great opportunity for work with customers, learn ,  work in different positions, give the opportunity to demonstrate what you learn and give the opportunity for apply for others positions on the company and grow on it."
good,"Home Depot is a descent place to work. Typical retail responsibilities. Customer assistance, zoning aisle, inventory and cashiering. The atmosphere is friendly with both co-workers and customers. During the slow seasons it can be a bit boring, making for long days. The floors are concrete so good insoles are a must to avoid pain."
good,"I walked in not knowing anything about hardware, I was scared, I was nervous, but with great supervisors I soon became one of the best hardware associates there, with the ability to do all things from helping with tools and what accessories work best, to what nail is best suitable for the job you're doing. Home Depot helped me a lot! I would definitely work there again."
good,I was an assistant store manager of operations. Is a good place to work with good benefits and decent pay but you have to know when to say no to moving up within the company. Once you move up you can't go back down.
good,"Home Depot Warehouse Was A Good Place I Enjoyed Working At.It Was A Smooth Pace. Then I Started Working By Myself. Only Because I Was Fast Paced, Not That I Wanted To Get Done Fast, I Was Just Serous About My Job Every Job"
good,"All the cashiers were dependent on each other, so we were very much like a family. We were able to count on one another, except for when someone called out, but that happens. The hardest part was dealing with customers and being able to manage breaks and lunches and the customer lines when a coworker called out."
good,"Receiving all goods and keeping customer service number one, learned how to handle multiple situations at once and angry people and how to use and sale people the correct items needed for their home improvement needs, nothing was hard, but the most enjoyable part was meeting the needs of the store and servicing the many customers"
good,"There are always lazy individuals, that lack personal motivation, who seem to soak up hours at the home depot.  For those who like to keep busy, while receiving a fair amount of pay and benefits, have no fear because there are plenty of customers and tasks to keep you busy.  Your commitment will depend entirely on how well you can stomach the inadequate amount of hours provided by corporate for staffing the store, paired with customer feedback based on their expectations for service, and how well you receive feedback from management that you have to be more productive as an individual without more support."
good,Your typical warehouse position. Easy enough job to do. A lot of lifting and moving product. Stocking goods. Unloading containers. Time usually flies.
good,"Everyone has their job and when they're done right like Home Depot, good things happen. All the other employees were happy and understanding, I never felt I wasn't apart of the team."
good,I loved working for Home Depot call center. My manager and most managers are very helpful and easy going. The only thing I would have to complain about are the hours. They are willing to work with you but its very hard to get approved for what you would prefer.  The working environment is amazing.
good,It’s a very nice and fun place to work. Just a lot of people always telling you to do something for then instead of asking you to help them with their project.
good,"worked as kitchen and bath designer is always fun for me I love what I do and give much information to the installer how and why what you design and what parts will be attached to it, once the project is complete and customer praise their kitchen or bath is beautifully design I feel that I got my reward."
good,I would recommended this company for someone looking to work for them. I enjoyed working here! I've been with this comany now for about 7 months and i'm forklift certified.
good,I would open the department check paint dispensers fill if necessary log on to the machines inspect operation of the dispensers by running sample test. Attend daily meetings with management for information on the department and any special sales in the store. Home Depot keeps the store clean and safe environment for employees and customers. The hardest part of the job was lifting 5 gallon paint buckets. The most enjoyable part of the job was to help customers. I also trained to use the sit down forklift and the Reach truck as well for bringing down products from the over head and to assist with customer loads into their vehicles.
good,A large company so they offer pretty good benefits. There is definitely room for growth because they usually hire management from within. Hard work doesn't go unrecognized.
good,"Standard customer service retail experience. The customer's are the worst and management can be difficult sometimes. If you're good at your job and you know what you're doing, it will be a great place to work. The hours are flexible and depending on management, they are almost always able to work with your schedule (within reason)."
good,"the regular customers and staff always keeps the day going by fast, meaning there's always someone to talk to. employees and management are nice and very knowledgeable about the store."
good,Very laidback  atmosphere. They promote from within and offer training so that you can be used in multiple positions which makes it easier to advance in the company.

good,"I enjoyed the service projects The Home Depot were greatly involved in. We not only serviced the people in our store, but we also helped those in need"
good,"The job is really easy, but it is a dice roll what manager you get. Calls are busy during Sale weeks. Approximately 30 calls per day on an average non-sale week."
good,"This place is great. Management is very professional and friendly. my typical night would consist of overnight stocking, unloading trucks, organizing merchandise."
good,The pay is pretty good at $10/hr. The job gets really hectic at the times of 11 AM-2PM. The hardest part of the job is not knowing where everything is.
good,"Would recommend Home Depot to a friend, very friendly with their open door policy. Had a great time with the staff and customers, from training to working on the floor very great."
good,"Management and HR were incredibly difficult to get ahold of regarding any work conflicts. Otherwise, working here was fantastic. All other part-time employees were great, and the job itself was as enjoyable as expected."
good,"Unless you intend to go corporate, or into management, it sucks to be a part timer, and worse as a full timer, at least at the store I worked at. "
good,Really take care of employees. culture is fantastic.  they allow you to grow personally and professionally!  work/life balance not all that good.  very rewarding financially.
good,les possibilités davancement ne sont pas interesentes meme dans les departements de conception
good,"Typical work days can vary between light work duties and heavy lifting on a constant basis. After orientation you must complete an extensive amount of training before you are given an apron and are allowed to begin on the sales floor. The work place culture is great for college students who need a part time job. The home depot has a ""fun committee"" that plans cook outs and celebrations. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new things and assisting customers."
good,Home depot has a friendly working environment where we are all like a family. we work as a team and we help each other to achieve our company goals. its a great place to be because everybody is appreciated at the end of the day.
good,Good part time job.  Worked around my school schedule.  Would definitely recommend working for this company.  Decent money for the amount of work you do.
good,"Working at the Home Depot is different depending on where you work. It could be a fun fast paced environment, or a slow stressful crawl. Usually you would get cross trained in other departments other than your own, which in my opinion is a good thing. Management at about half of the locations i've worked at played favorites among employees so be mindful of that."
good,"Makes customers the first priority, seeks to fully understand the customers needs and project.Acts with integrity, maintains professional appearance works effectively with others, resolves conflict.I enjoyed receive costumers orders online,and communicating to manager on duty of freight being received."
good,"If you want more hours they are more than willing to give them to you. There's also a lot of room for growth within the company if you want to stay with them. Additionally, there are very generous benefits when it comes to breaks and overtime pay."

good,"Greeting and assisting customers with their home improvement project. You will learn tips from the professionals that has been doing for years. To the people that would like to save money and do it themselves. The managers are great help and encourage you to learn the trade. Whether in your department or others. The hardest part of the job is when a short staff in a department occurs. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home with a smile, satisfied, and with no injuries."
good,serve the customer as the best that we can. No matter what happen Customer always right. and I was trying to do my best every day in home depot.as a cashier we help customer to if they ask something regarding supplies that they may need.

good,"Would recommend to anyone looking for a fast pace and friendly"

good,"unload  truck ,replenish shelves ,keep floor clean and safe, of debris and merchandise, cashier when store becomes busy  and good customer service to shoppers"
good,"A typical day with working with customers is to help customers with usually painting their new or current homes. Dying or repainting their driveways, patios, or fences. I learned the certain materials, paints, ways of knowing how to paint a patio, fence, or house properly. The hardest was remembering to learning and remembering every detail about the project."
good,"A lot of the associates there do not really like to work so they spend most of their time in the break room or hiding. While the goal was to offer impeccable customer service, a lot of the associates do not enjoy heavy lifting or manual labor what so ever."

good,"Home Depot offers many great benefits is very flexible on working hours however depending on which department you work it becomes difficult to truly work because there is never enough workers and management refuses to hire more workers because they must maintain a certain budget. Overall a very good company with tons of benefits and life skills. People are often friendly, with all this hard work, tons of benefits are included."
good,"Assist customers with the selection of paint and paint products.  "
good,"It's very fast paced, management is always there for you and very helpful. There's always someone helping you to move up the ladder. The most enjoyable part would be working and training my head cashiers, cashiers and meeting new people."
good,its a slow passed job in most departments that require good customer communication skills. the incentive to do good is a fun part of the job. they give you a badge for your achievements that lead to rewards.
good,I loved using the fork lift and standing machine fork lift. Days would go by fast due to the fast pace demand there. Had fun made lots of friends. Would love to go back and work there great job.
good,A fun loving work environment with a caring management team and family oriented staff members. The company prioritizes customer service and career growth for its employee.  I personally enjoy interacting with the customers and building a relationship with them. My customers are dear to me and are treated like a part of the family at the workplace.
good,"Once you learn where everything in the store goes there really isn't that much else to learn except how to operate the machines. The management is fantastic, they are true leaders who lead from the front and are great to work with."

good,"True to its founding values, the Home Depot strives to give it's employees the opportunities of growth and advancement to associates at all levels. A store buggy pusher can rise to CEO within the organization if they spend their time networking, taking advantage of training opportunities,  put on the effort needed to advance their career. It's a great place to work and add new skills."
good,"Home Depot was a new thing for me. Hard work and fast moving job. They had incentives for extra pay on employees who had worked the longest. I earned my first year but, sadly never received my bonus. Not good fort trust."
good,I enjoy the people and the place. Ive worked for competitors and Home Depot treats there employees way better.You will find that yes your schedule rotates and you may work every weekend but if you can get passed that Home Depot is an exceptional job in retail to have.

It provides a level of experience that will prepare people who are new in the work field to know how to give good customer service and also people who just want to settle down until retirement and have something to do in the meanwhile. The family environment is great and you always feel welcomed. Now I will say, it's not a perfect place but it's nothing that can't be improved in the meantime but those are personal experiences people have and there's always room for improvement. Overall, it's a great company to work for."
good,"It’s retail and you have to like working with customers and people. Fast pace, sometimes short staffed. Fellow associates are great to work  work environment is great"

good,typical day at work is put on your apron and walk around and help customers. I worked in the floor and wall department. It was difficult at first because I knew nothing about that stuff but was very easy to learn
good,The Home Depot is very tight-knit and they are very welcoming. I would suggest to almost anyone that they apply there if they are looking for a decent job with friendly people.
good,"I truly enjoyed working for The Home Depot as an assistant manager. There was a lot of work but the benefits were very good. And bonuses twice a year helped too. "
good,"The Home Depot is the cream of the crop when it comes to starting out one's professional career. It offers flexible hours, a solid learning environment for training and personal growth, and ample opportunity for acquiring new skills. I only wish that pay could be renegotiated to help compensate for the increasing cost of living in my area."
good,stressfull to be honest the pay was not that great at all. the workers and co workers and managers were not the nicest to me. the people overall hated eachotheer

good,Had really great managemnet and helped alot with family  where very good mangemnet but will fire for anything very quickly . Had great food and great schudels for family
good,"The bottom line is that you can go as far as you want to go with Home Depot if you apply yourself. If you want to remain hourly and just do your job, have at it. If you genuinely want to move up, then it is on you to take that direction, and they will help you get there if you are willing to work toward it."
good,"As a company the values of the Home Depot are associate centered and can make for a great work experience. Whether or not the management team and other associates uphold these values will affect your experience. I've had great managers and not so great managers, great co-workers and not so great co-workers. Whether or not you uphold the values of the company will also greatly affect your experience. In short it is what you make it."
good,"Youre always putting stuff on shelf. always taking stuff out of boxes and restocking, always same all the time, but pay is always there. I had to leave because the job wasn't teaching me anyting."
good,Benefits are great but could be better as hard as we work I think we deserve a little better pay. To be honest I do love working with my team but for me I need more responsibility. I am a hard worker and once I get used to the job and learned what I needed got learn. I am always looking for more ways to improve and go above and beyond.

good,"Fun place to work and the atmosphere is great. You begin to learn so many things at the store, it does actually prepare yourself to take care of yourself and to solve all the struggles; hardware, painting, electric, plumbing, etc. I cannot imagine without Home Depot by my side and the experience I have from the company I would not be responsible to take care of my household and other properties around me."
good,Easy to work and go to school. Pay is minimum but great place to learn how to use equipment. Possible chances of moving up in the business. Workplace is mix of young and older generation.
good,It was hard labor but definitely fun and not for everyone as i worked in the lumber department. The management wasn't the best and led to a lot of day working alone in an entire department. Other than that it was a place i would love to work again.

I learned a lot between every department such good knowledge to know. The managers their were fair not to bad, the hardest part of it was on the weekends we would be super busy and I would get the carts and put them for customers convenience and in about 20-30min there was no more because they were all around the store being used by customers and sometimes we would be so backed up they'd only have 1-2 loading assistants and most likely we'd either be busy with load outs or getting carts tried the best we could to stay on top with the carts but they didn't have too many for everyone to use one. the most enjoyable time was breaks, lunch, then getting to go home."

On a typical work day I would ensure that we were properly staffed and ready to assist our customers finding everything they needed for their projects. I learned how to manage and problem solve. The hardest part of my job was when I would sit in on a employee termination. The most enjoyable put of my job was make sure our customers were satisfied with their shopping experience and doing employee appreciation thing/gestures throughout the work week to keep employees motivated.

good,"I love the associates and the customers. It is very fast paced and challenging. You have to be able to assist customers in every department and be very flexible.

good,"Working as a special service agent I have a thorough knowledge of all policies, procedures, and duties related to customer transactions, cash handling and the Service Desk."

good,"Home depot is a nice place to work, but they hold you responsible for voc's and opening credit cards, which is not fair. The employees see nothing of any value from opening the cards, while management see's financial proceeds and bonuses. The raises are not fair, they pay us just enough, but not enough to make a living. Please do better by your employees"
good,"Pretty relaxed, would be nice as large and well established they are, they would offer full time employment. Will work with after hours activities, religious beliefs. Some stores will provide meals."
good,"spent most of night stocking shelves with product, sometimes special projects,work alone and as part of a team,management very good to work for, hardest part of the job is pace,best part is knowing you got it done"
good,"Its fun once you get the hang of everything, at times it can be frustrating but overall if you work hard there nothing you cant do. it's very easy to move up in the company."
good,"Overall a great company to work for; with a positive overall trajectory.   However, management does not address senior leaders that are very poor leaders / contrary to company values; so they linger and block / hold back career advancement for others."
good,Opportunities were very good. You can transfer to other stores fairly easily. If you apply for a position you will be interviewed. Which gives anyone a chance at a new position.
good,I love fixing all the tools that folks break. I liked the people I worked with and for the most part I liked THD because of all the benefits they have for everyone.

good,the company takes it time to train there associate well for their task. There's always something new to learn and do. The managers take their time to hear out what associates have to say for improvement
good,"As an in-store promoter, the company could have taken some very sound advice and corrected certain issues with the position. However, management decided to go in the opposite direction and ruined the position's essential function."
good,Is was a really good workplace. The was ups  and downs I liked working there. Most of the people there were friendly and kind. It really didn't pay for the complete expenses  of everything but it was a income coming in
good,The Home Depot is a company where I gained supervisor experience  in a role of management and gained high quality skills in customer service and computers.
good,it was ok I guess I liked working there! just wasn't room to advance. or it had to be someone you knew to do so. but they need to pay more as well . but it was cool.
good,If you have worked retail in any other location you've worked it here. This is a standard retail job with all the pros and cons that come with that. You know what to expect.

Most days are spent at a register checking out and helping customers find products they need for projects in the store.

good,"Working at the Home Depot was a fast-paced experience with enough structure for comfort but enough variety to keep it interesting. The managers had a concern for our well-being and performance to such a degree that I never felt pressured to meet demands quicker than I could. Other associates were very helpful, but most work could easily be completed alone."
good,"I did order fulfillment. I worked on a team with 3 other guys. Would come in and sometimes the pick list would be full, during the summer it is. And if you're alone the rest of the day can be a hassle. But if you're with someone, the day can be too easy. I always have something to do, so the days go by quick."
good,I like the whole environment and no one is telling me what to say i love the people that i work with because even if i mess up they lift me right back up and is really kind to me

good,"Assisting customers with their purchases, moving heavy objects, and maintaining a clean and efficient workplace. I learned many skills in the fields of construction, landscaping, and wood working. Hardest part of the job was working closely with contractors and coordinating between them. The most enjoyable part of the job was my fellow employees."

good,"A typical day at the Home Depot entails restocking returned merchandise, attending to customers on sales floor and pulling pallets down using heavy machinery (i.e. forklift, reach, etc.) whilst maintaining a safe working environment and managing time efficiently."
good,Great place to work. Only issue is they won't allow you to move departments for 6 months even if you have a justifiable excuse. I needed to change my schedule because of classes and they basically said no so I quit.

good,My typical day starts off with a check list that has to get done everyday then once thats complete you move on to the orders.I learned working at the customer service desk you need patience and calmness and not to let customer or issues get to you and that its just a job and you shouldn't have to take on big responsibility by your self and that theirs others that are willing to help you out. Best part of the job is getting to help customers with there issues and be able to get them in and out in timely matter since that makes all customer happy.

good,"I loved it at Home Depot, I wish I worked inside but being a lit attendant wasn’t bad. I always had water/Gatorade. The managers were flexible and considerate when making schedules"
good,Good position for someone interested in merchandising/marketing. Great workplace cultural centered around teamwork. A typical day consists of following corporate plans for product placement within the store.
good,"It was a fun work environment. Customers are nice/cool people if you do your job right which is common sense. The stories about rude customers is usually because the associate him/herself isn't doing their job right. Overall great job, only negative is PAY. Pay is too low to stay there too long"
good,"A normal day at Home depot is coming in and going to the manager or supervisor on the shift and asking what task needs to get done this day. Usually we would have about 5 to 6 charts a night full of electrical and its our job to be able to put as much out in the four hours that we work each night. The workplace culture is very laid back and all is understanding and have own objectives to do for each department. One of the hardest parts on the job is when we get more freight then usual and we have hardly anyone scheduled that night. It makes the day longer and we have to do more then our own position and department because theirs not enough employees to work each day. Therefore if we were not understaffed then stuff like this would not occur all the time. I enjoy that we do not have to work on weekends therefore, we can enjoy the end of the week."

good,"The Home Depot is a great company because it offers an open and success driven work environment for anyone that has the motivation to do well. They take care of their employees, even if said employee only works 15 hours a week. They have great talent development programs in place and are willing to promote the hard working."
good,"Great place to learn and interact with customers. Nice environment. Good training, fast paced. Growth opportunities. Balanced time off. Good culture. Enjoyed it."
good,"Good job, people expect you to never mess up and comply with everything they tell you. The Home Depot has a good message and a good venue but the manual labor doesn't compensate for the pay. It is hard to move up and hard to communicate with the management."
good,Lots of responsibilities given to employees that made you feel a sense of pride in your work. You were let to handle many tasks on your own and to use your best judgement in completing them.
good,Working at Home Depot is a fun experience.  I am learning on a daily basis of all the things inside the store.  All the management people are very supportive with everyone.
good,"Generally, you meet all manner of clients in a retail environment. In the Home Depot, that is no exception, however, you also meet interesting co-workers as well. The culture in the stores are usually camaraderie, granted it is not too busy. Overall there is more good than bad about working at Home Depot."

good,I worked with Home Depot in the Holland Michigan store from the time it was brand new in 2006 to about 4 months before they closed in mid 2011. I miss the staff most. the customers were usually pretty level headed.  From the time I started work was constant. The more experience you have in home building and products the better. There was a shift in responsibilities near the housing crash of 2008. We took this added work with little to no change in hourly wages. Ordering products for the store and managing the inventories were added to the normal helping customers in the daily work. Most of the management was great and miss working with them.
good,"I enjoy meeting customers of diverse cultures and levels of education and always helping them to buy the right product for their project , Its a good place to work ."
good,At first glance The Home Depot could be an intimidating environment via the amount of merchandise and product knowledge required to best help customers with personal and business needs and goals. But through the tedious work load and high demand customers The Home Depot supplies its employees with monthly classes and mentorships by the outstanding staff. The Home Depot also gives its employees a six month bonus check through our success sharing program.

good,I had very good days at home depot. I learned how to drive sales and credit. The management team needed better training. The hardest part of the job was when it would get busy with not enough associates to help with the amount of customer that would come through the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was the monthly meetings and how the company would reward the associates every month.
good,"It was a great group.  Good management and peers. Like minded people."
good,"· As a cashier I was providing customers with fast, friendly accurate and safe service.  I was responsible for the money in my register & it's balancing on a daily basis.

In golidays we have the time to enjoy a little bit while working, there is aleays something going on such as bbqs or some food the manager made and offer the workers"
good,"Often in large corporations, what is desired at the top does not translate to what happens at the grass roots.  Overall, though, the company does a really good job of trying to do the right thing, usually not at the expense of the employee.  Individual managers have various levels of competencies, and some are put in positions before they are ready to lead."

good,"Se puede laborar relajadamente ,  con un buen equipo de trabajo"
good,"A typical day at work consists of me putting on my apron, reporting to my supervisor and doing my daily tasks. My daily tasks consists of loading construction materials into contractors vehicles, bringing carriages and flat beds to the store entrance and greeting customers as they leave and enter the store. I learned a lot about the policies and regulations for employees within the store. For example never chase or initiate physical contact with people trying to steal merchandise. Never harass or discriminate other people. If employees do violate these rules, you could be fired. The hardest part is being on my feet for so long. It's very tiring standing for so long. I think the culture and management are great. I have no complaints about how the store is run. The most enjoyable part in my opinion is assisting customers in multiple different ways such as moving heavy items and finding items in the store."
good,The company is very understanding and will work with you if you need accommodations to anything. Every employee is given a list of tasks to finish within their shift range and employees are rewarded for hard work.

good,"I was first worked in call center to providing quality customer service to associates and managers by researching and resolving associate pay and human resources escalation issues including leave of absence and payroll law inquiries in a timely manner.  Contacts made through inbound or outbound calls, fax or emails.  I was promoted to an HR center research associate where I resolved mostly leave of absence and legal issues for managers and associates.  Having been in a corporate environment, Home Depot proved to be one of the best culture wise.  I felt they sincerely cared about their associates and would highly recommend this company.  Hardest part of the job was the attention to detail.  You really had to make sure you were doing everything by the book because decisions were pay impacting as well as determining the livelihood of associates."
good,Every morning they have a employee rally to boost morale. Super bosses and everyone works together creating a wonderful environment. Helping customers was always fun for me because I am very Knowledgeable about all their items. Knowledge is courage!
good,"Must have common courtesy, must pay attention to details "

good,Great thing about HOME DEPOT is the profit sharing (success) party's they had every 6 months and the profit sharing checks and the associates are great along with the customers
good,"Good place to work where hard work is recognized and rewarded. A physical environment in a warehouse setting, with a variety of ""Do-it-yourself"" and /or contractor products."
good,"Clean bays, set up or reset bays according to planograms, set up new displays, change pricing tags.  You standing, walking and moving your whole shift, physical but not bad. I learned how stores are set up by merchant and how to work with a team.  My manager was very nice, took his job seriously but treated employees well.  Co worked were nice. Culture is casual, client service friendly.  Most enjoyable, the atmosphere. very casual, lots to do, day went very fast.  Hardest part was not having enough time to fix bays properly, only about 5 min in each bay, so trying to find missing stock in a short amount of time could be stressful since it rarely was where it was suppose to be."
good,"An ambitious, goal oriented individual with extensive years of Sales experience. Demonstrated"
good,"Great company to work for but they have to pay their qualified employees much higher.  If you are not management, you need two jobs to live.  If they paid higher, I would still be there for life."
good,For the most part and positive place to work. Did have some issues around scheduling there for was moved from one department to another white management help me fit into each department that are working
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at The Home Depot. Everyone was nice and help was always easy to find if needed. During my time working there, I can honestly say that I learned a lot that can be used in my future."
good,"This is a very fast paced and productive environment. This job is not for the lazy...men could do this with one hand tied behind their back. It can be VERY hard on a woman to lift 50,60, 70 pounds for 10 hours a day, sometimes having to lift the boxes above you're head. Would be nice if they had something alil less strenuous for a woman. Other than that job is great, pay is fine."
good,I worked here as a cashier and also worked in other departments. Working here wasn't stressful but they pay was low. The manager was easy to get along with.
good,I only left because the hours got to be to demanding as I was working it on my days off from a full time job.  It was a good job and overall good management.
good,It was a job I appreciated it the staff was amazing they work with you if you need help if you was to have a tragic loss they would match dollar amount. If I had to or needed to go back I wouldn’t have a problem doing so
good,"Good experience, enjoyed working here for the time being but not a place I was planning to stay at. Definitely has good benefits and good working environment, but not the best pay"
good,"I enjoyed working here, the pay was good.  What I didn't like was that I had to travel over 50 miles each way to get to my store.  I loved learning about all the products"
good,"Good place to start or finish your career however if this company really wants to achieve it's goal better pay and better workers and change of environment will need to take place."
good,Un buen empleo para estudiantes que buscan un ingreso extra para pagar sus estudios.
good,I had an excellent 4 years working at The Home-Depot and gained valuable skills from my time there. I would recommend this job to anyone who wants to work part time and go to school since the scheduling is very flexible.
good,"Long hours standing"
good,"productive with opportunities to grow within the company,  but it takes time to move up with a store. some employee get in a close net group with management and those are the ones with more opportunities."
good,"company and management really care about the people, work schedule is great, some employees don't work as hard as others, got trained on pacer, clamp and reach truck"
good,A typical day could be easy or hard depending on whether you open the story by yourself or not. On the likely chance that you are by yourself in the morning you have to be at the store an hour before the store opens which can be as early as 5 am. You have to clean your section of the store and do safety checks that are due by the time the store open's for customers. You get backup in our section around 10-12 pm and by then your schedule to take a lunch. The hardest part was finding the drive to keep up with the work load when by yourself. Everything that needs to be done is at least a two person job. The best part of the job was the co-workers.
good,"Paid fairly"
good,To earned a living for the family. Be patient in facing different costumers. Be honest even without the presence of the superior and report any damages occured during our work. The hardest job is being a delivery driver. The mist enjoyable part is receiving our bunoses and anniversary of the company every year like trip to boracay.
good,"quick paced work with coworkers willing to help out, management is most of the time great, every now and then you'll get a manager that is rude and doesn't really seem to care about your issues."
good,home depot cares about us and about our custumer. all the associates works on team and they always put the customer first. the hours are from 6 am to 9pm

good,My typical day at work revolves around assisting customers in finding proper hardware for basic home improvements. From this position I have established reputation in cultivating positive relationships with clients and peers.
good,"I learned a lot about different departments. I loved working here because I learned how to drive a forklift, how to work with different types of Lumber, and I loved working with customers with whatever questions they had for me."
good,Just wish we had more hours I had learned alot from this place I enjoy working here but sometimes is hard when staff calls off then we short on staff and it becomes messy
good,"positive environment, employees respectful and very helpful to one another.  excellent customer service performed by everyone.  lots of fun activities from time to time.  great benefits and perks.  Management is very fair and very hands on.  Home Depot is very diverse, non discriminative against the disabled, race, gender, color or creed.  The hardest part of the job is standing for long hours on the concrete floor."
good,I enjoyed working at the Home Depot. I learned a lot. I was able to obtain my Fork Lift certification. I met a lot of new acquaintances . I enjoyed helping others.
good,"son empresa de retos diarios y con mucho apegos a procesos buscan tener a su personal bien, aprendí a la toma de decisiones a desarrollar gente y a cuidar y administrar los gastos del departamento de embarques así como capacitación de varios compañeros de otras plazas, la gerencia te brindaba el apoyo para que te desenvolvieras correctamente en tus labores, la cultura laboral es buena pero creo que puede mejorar en la actitud de servicio, lo mas difícil es tomar la desicion de dejarla, la relación que tuve con mucha gente tanto asociados como directivos"
good,"It's a good place to work at. Sometimes it can be difficult due to customers having different home projects, but over time you'll gain knowledge to answer most of their questions."
good,"the staff and management were nice. A fun environment, helping others improve their homes was satisfying since most people work hard for their homes and take great pride in their accomplishments"
good,Soy una muy responsable con su trabajo y muy comprometida
good,The day consists of helping customers and creating a bond with them. To help customers projects run smoothly and give the best customer service you can.
good,it was good at first. some of the wokers were really rude especially when i was pregnant. sometimes i did not get enough hours. the other workers were very friendly.
good,"Typical day is busy and lots of customers with lots of questions, fast paced but sometimes slow. Good managers, some care. Good starting pay, better than most places"
good,"I worked for Home Depot for seven years. Unfortunately, I witnessed an extremely high turn-over rate within management alone. The opportunity for growth and advancement is continuously present. I consider myself having ""grown up"" while working for an overall amazing company. The demand for work results is ever-present, however, compensation for hard work and effort is more than provided."
good,"Provided customer service, stand for long periods of a time, communication between associates, competitiveness when getting a credit card, be able to help multiple customers when products"
good,home depot supports their staff very well. They are also very flexible with school schedules building you up and giving you ever lasting support. Theres also lots of room to grow.

good,Working for a competitive company. I learned something new everyday. Management was always helpful. The hardest thing was being on my feet all day but I enjoyed meeting new people daily
good,"Its not always the great but I really love the work environment. Hardest part of my job would be the customers just because they can be nasty, but that's retail."
good,"Very Good company to work with very slow paced environment to work in , easy promotions pay was alright and hours was very good , paid vacation was a plus"
good,"Home Depot was a great company to work for. I enjoyed my experience with home depot, they are great opportunity for there employers. It is a well keep up school for the employee and the customers"
good,"La cultura, el entorno y la estabilidad que ofrece esta empresa hacen de ella una excelente opcion laboral."
good,"A typical day for me at the beginning of the week is to get paper work done, customer service, smart list, accuse report done, put paint freight away, meeting in the afternoon. The rest of the week is customer service, mixing paint, pack down to fill holes on shelves, putting freight away. Helping in other departments when they need help. I learned a lot about how to color, match paint. How paint works on different areas. The management part was hard for me when I had 1 employee that didn't want to work with me. The hardest part of the job was them expecting some of us good workers to do more than others. I enjoyed working with most of the other employees, customers, learning all I've learned."
good,The Home Depot provides  the opportunity for advancement at all levels. They have excellent benefits and they believe their people as their best assets.
good,This was a very relaxing job. I was able to gain valuable information regarding constructions and customer service. Most of the customers that visited The Home Depot Knew what they were doing so it was fairly easy to let them shop.
good,Must be able to adapt to change easily and know the customer.  Perform in accordance with the company's customer service policy.  Able to work under pressure. Provide support to Management Team when required.
good,I like The Home Depot i just rather have another type of work.  I dont like warehouse work.  I do good at factory type of work and that is what i am trying to go for.
good,For the most part the store I worked at had a good working culture or atmosphere.  The staff for the most part were very supportive and mutually helpful for each other .
good,Typical work day for managers are 10-12 hours.  Sometimes hard to see advancement opportunities.  Home Depot doesn't provide enough time off for their salary managers.
good,I really enjoyed working at Home Depot. It was a great place to develop skills and work ethics. A great place to interact with customers and help them with any questions or recommendations.
good,It is a good experience and good working atmosphere.Great working conditions and friendly employees and managers. The location is in a business park with close to expressway and rural roads.
good,"Great benefits, but they do not pay their hourly associates enough. Management is generally pretty good, but it does differ from store to store. Full time associates have set hours, but not set days. Managers work whatever times that they are scheduled."
good,A typical work day at the Home Depot varies dependent upon the department that you are in. The garden and seasonal department usually has the highest workload through out the year and requires the most attenion.
good,"good place to work. Very Busy, fast paced  distribution warehouse. Learn a lot about different aspects of the distribution business. Good shifts available."
good,"I work with customers finding products, recommending better products and processing customers sales transactions and returns. Also assisted customers with their concerns."
good,I started out as a lot associate then promoted to stocker.  The lot associate I placed all carts back in Home Depot and helped customers put merchandise in their car.  I enjoyed working as a stocker because it was always busy and high paced
good,I still work here on the weekends it is a great part time job I would not recommend working here full time because its only about 10 dollars an hour bit its fine if youre parttime.
good,"You really can grow as much as you want to with this company. Like most retail places, some managers are great, some are soso. Only negative I have is, raises are hard to negotiate."
good,Enjoyed the environment that was created within the stores. Company has gone through a lot of change some being good and some being a learning experience.
good,"Home Depot was a nice place to work. It has a very friendly and family oriented environment. Everything about this job is great, except for advancement. Advancement often seems susceptible to favoritism. Also, the manager defines your experience. An attentive manager is the best manager. Also, because the job environment is almost completely teamwork oriented, having lazy coworkers that take shortcuts will bring you and the rest of the team down."
good,Good place to work and learn they treat everyone great there and are willing to cross train and help people grow the job into a career. but at the end of the day its a retail job.
good,Cashing out customers and helping customers find or get information on products that they may need for a project or personal needs. Good work environment and customer service.
good,"I personally like working there, however it is not what I would want to do for the rest of my life unless I was in management.  I have been in management all my life so taking the big step backwards has been hard.  There are great people that run the place."
good,"Work is fun and enjoyable, the environment is friendly and usually at a fast pace. However, they rarely promote people and they pay minimum wage for positions that should be paid more, such as Appliances sales."
good,"I worked at two different Home Depots in the 3 years I was employed by them. Great place to work, always places to move up and advance to. The different shifts can be challenging but not impossible."
good,good job to start your working career as I did fun working staff hardest part of the job that I did was unloading trailers other tan that the job was easy
good,This job allowed me to improve my customer services skills while learning a great deal about the products they sell.  As a full time student they were able to provide me with a work schedule they worked well with my school schedule.
good,"Quick paced and on the move. "
good,"Always something to do, plenty of room for advancement if you are willing to relocate. Clear and concise objectives. Love working here, and love the people that I work with."
good,"They do extensive training and are a fair employer."
good,Once you get hired you can essentially make your own schedule which for me is one of the big perks of working at this company. My department was great and I got along well with everyone. Even the managers were very nice. I often got very good reviews and was offered a full time position on many occasions (I could not accept it because I am involved in full time volunteer work as well). The benefits are nice and competitive with similar companies. The hourly wage in my opinion is poor and is a big drawback of working for this company. Another drawback is the managers work very long hours and are required to occasionally work the overnight shift. I very often feel bad for my managers who in my opinion are worked like slaves. Although I hear they get paid well but I wouldn’t know. For me working full time for many years at a very low income to become a decently paid manager who is a slave does not sound the slightest bit appealing to me. So although I have been somewhat happy working with this company for a few years I don’t really see a future with this company and will be looking elsewhere.
good,very excited to work for this company and would love to work for them again. I learned a lot and feel like there is opportunity to grow within the company.
good,"good to learn new things "
good,"Good and established company that is nationally know with many employees both full and part time.  I would recommend working for this company, as i have been."
good,"It's a good place to work, but the hours and days to work are constantly changing. Sometimes the number of hours can dip below 20. My department was fast-paced and I never knew boredom. I had a lovely Dept. Supervisor."
good,"Overnight work stocking shelves.  Easy job with no brain work required, great for students.  A lot of people can not handle working over night however.  Management support is good and if I was looking for full time this place has growth potential."
good,"It really depends on your team, but it is a great part time job. Management is fine and it is easy to switch the type of work that you do in the store."
good,Over all a good place to work. Managers are easy to work with. You learn something new every day about the home depot.The employees are very into the job. Hardest part of the job is the overnights.
good,"Since it's been  5 years since I've worked there, workplace environments change a lot. However, I don't recall a negative work culture or poor management. Again, my co-workers were just co-workers."
good,Working for Home Depot was fun and I would recommend to anyone in need of part-time work or even full-time. I was able to work in several departments all of which give the employees a chance to learn something new.
good,The only reason I left was because school was starting up and I couldn’t balance the two.  I would absolutely recommend Home Depot to anyone who asks.
good,"Overall a great place to work. Pretty flexible with schedules.  Offer great benefits, vacation, sick/personal time.  Good pay, bonuses."
good,"The best part about working at home depot is the relationships you build with your customers and fellow associates. Decent opportunities for bonuses every half, but limited opportunities for advancement to management without relocation."
good,I'd give The RLC I was employed at at 6 Out of 10 rateing. The hours are great. The facility needed to improve its parking. Overall a good place to work.
good,As a cashier you have to greet tge customers as they come in the door. If you have a problem you should always call the manager to help you with a situation. If you know what a product is you can call a manager out their department for assistant.
good,"Relaxed atmosphere for a developer to start his/her career. less pressure, No unrealistic deadlines will be give for the story. You have freedom and trust while you work."
good,I enjoyed meeting new people and helping them solve household problems with the products Home Depot had to offer. Suggesting repairs and how - to classes. Customer Service oriented job.  Very satisfying.
good,"My job includes mostly unloading freight and sorting inventory by aisle. It was a very nice part time job, and everyone was very helpful and polite even management."
good,the people and management that I worked for were all very nice. Hardest part of the job was customers not all were bad some just had a vision of what they wanted but didn't know how to explain it.
good,"Very enjoyable place to work. The culture is very fun and upbeat. Physical labor can be quite demanding, but customer provide balance to the workplace. Benefits are very competitive. Pay is suitable."
good,The Home Depot is a place where people go the extra mile to address customer concerns. My coworkers are always studying policies in order to keep up with customer demands.
good,good place to work if you need a flexible schedule. I worked with wood and enjoyed working with everyone and getting a chance to do more with my hands as well as customer service.
good,"Met Team , was an overnight job where I handle putting things together such as seasonal displays and workshop projects. It was a great experience working overnight."
good,"A very great place to work in.  The environment is friendly and very helpful. The management team is enthusiastic, helpful, hardworking, and very fast-paced"
good,"My time at Home Depot has been nothing but learning and great experience for my future endeavors. With becoming certified with a forklift and learning the ropes of the job, I am ready to move on in my career. I have acquired many skills that I will be bringing with me to my future job. With looking for full time work and better pay, I am ready to excel at another workplace."
good,"Lots of physical work. Had to help customers load up 60-80 pounds of concrete bags, mostly in sets of at least 10. Sometimes 30 or more! Had to move quickly as multiple customers requested for help with loading their product into their vehicles. Had to maintain parking lot by returning regular shopping carts and lumber cats. I also pitched in from time to time to help out with cashiering. Pitched in with cutting lumber for customers, and trees around Christmas time. Snow shoveling in the winter time. Lots and lots a physical and hard work."
good,This location is staffed with great hard working people who believe in the team concept.  The store was sometimes short staffed so helping all the customers was frustrating.
good,If you show that you have a good work ethic you will get good hours/shifts. Also you can move up in the company as long as you have skills and determination.
good,"Fun and fast pace work environment. Tons of room for advancement, great management and coworkers everyone helpful and skilled employees eager to help and train"
good,"Very fun place to work, great coworkers and management that made you feel like one big family. Only left to pursue my nursing career, would have stayed otherwise."
good,It was a fun and productive job for the most part. The customers were friendly and easily satisfied. The work environment was fast paced and coworkers were very helpful.
good,"Although it took me a long time to get hired.  The hiring process took quite some time.  I enjoyed working there, the work pace was fast and they had incentives for work well done."
good,"Nice people. A lot of work to accomplish in a short period of time. I would have enjoyed more autonomy. Overall, a good experience. I thought that the structure was perfect."
good,fun workplace but for me it was more temporary and part time until my next move. Nice group of people to work with. there is room for advancement supervisor manager department head if thats the route you would like to take
good,A typical day at home depot could be very productive. I learned to work at a steady pace. The workplace is very chilled everybody get's along with everybody.
good,A friendly and good place to work... working with amazing people and helping customers get what they want. The Home Depot also helps improve your skills in the Job that you do
good,I had a good relationship with the majority of my coworkers but we did not have enough staff or time to accomplish daily tasks. The culture of the store seems very positive but everyone was overwhelmed.
good,"Honestly, Home Depot has treated me the best so far out of all of my employment options. I was originally able to advance very quickly and the pay isn't too bad. The longer that I work there the more I realize that so long as you don't try to cheat the system, management will do their absolute best to work with you. The most difficult parts of the job are the training kind of sucks and people want to take advantage of the good workers."
good,Working for Home Depot is a step above what ive done in the past. Its relatively simple and exciting work at times. I feel confident in the fact that everyday i go to work. Im doing something new. Or ecountering a new problem to solve.  But i have seen the same issuses i see at so many other jobs.  Favoritism and lack of unity among the group.  Overall i like Home Depot but dont see it as a place to stay for many unless you can move up the coporate ladder quickly.
good,This was a great place to work and learn. The experience in the larger retailer was balanced and supportive to community engagement and building. There were lots great customers.
good,"Provide customer service call for new/existing calls."
good,"I go in, put my apron on, get carts and bring them back from the parking lot, help customers load and unload vehicles, as well as take care of the garbage at the end of the night. I learned that, associates are all on the same team. we all strive for the same goal; to advance, to have a career. The management is good in the store but only in the store where I work(mainly because I've never met upper management). I love the associates, they're a good crowd. the hardest part of the job I would have to say is dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable part is knowing at the end of your shift, you still have a job to go back to the next day"
good,Esta bastante bn la compañía puedes conocer muchos lugares q no conoces en P.A
good,"Home Depot is a very busy place. You need to be a people person."
good,"Great place to work specifically for the location, Yuma AZ is extremely hot and this job provided a temperature controlled environment. Young management team"
good,Fun environment but very physically demanding.  People who were built more for the physical labor tended to be lazy and not willing to help.  For the most part Home Depot was a great place to work.
good,Fun place to work. Liked the people that I worked with.Learned some things to make inventory better. Workimg with the customers was also a plus as I enjoy helping people.
good,"Productive workplace with lots of benefits and perks.There is great potential for training and college education from strategic partners like Kaplan University, Bellevue and Phoenix University to mention a few."
good,"The home depot is an excellent company to work for. whether you want to earn a quick dollar, or grow within the company itself, home depot puts the power in your hands. a typical day at work consist of working the schedules for the store, processing interview packets and answering any calls that comes through the phone. I've learned how to manage my time and how to effectively work alongside cooperate and management to get a job done and overlook the needs of the business. The most enjoyable part of working for the home depot is being able to help the associates along with management and making a difference in the lives of my associates."
good,recommend to anyone for part time work great work atmosphere. it was a very enjoyable experience learned a lot of product information. The hardest part was the dust .

good,Working at the home depot store was fun. I met and interacted with new people every day. There were the customers that were regulars at the home depot. I was always willing to learn whatever I could to further my career advancement. Management was always willing to lend a hand dealing with certain customers and always understanding. One of the hardest parts of the job is dealing with angry customers. I say this because no one wants to deal with them including management. But that's a part of the job and no matter what you always have to listen patiently and calmly. Because it's not always your fault for them to be angry but they might take it out on you.
good,"I love this jobs, good skills, definitely recommend this place to work in armory, happy place, good pay and remunerations. Excellent memories and skills"
good,"A typical day would start at night restocking, then would transition to sales associate in the flooring department. Management was great, very nice and caring people. Hardest part of the job was leaving."
good,the work life was pretty easy in comparison to most jobs. you only work about 8-10 hours a day and the work isn't too hard. the only downside is walking on concrete floors all day.
good,"I worked for the Home Depot DC for a period of 2 weeks. I would have stayed on longer if it were possible. The management was very nice and friendly. They offered a great benefits package, very neat and clean working environment. Company adhered to all saftey rules and reagulations. Management showed a genuine concern for the employees. The only thing negative I have to say about the Home Depot DC is that the position I was hired on for was just too physically demanding on my body. Lifting  and carrying products which weight in range of 10 - 80 lbs for 10 hours for four days out of the week is rigorus work to the body. The nature of the work injuried me and I had to resign because they would not allow me to transfer to another department."
good,"As a retail store, Home Depot is mostly about quick and efficient service to your guests. Easy to move up the ladder as long as you learn certain areas and equipment, and interact with people daily."

good,"Sales associate. Basic job functions are assisting customers, restocking product and keeping dept clean. Day goes by fast if you stay busy. Can learn a lot here."
good,"You learn a lot here if you listen to others.  If you don't know the answer to a customer question, just find someone who does but stay and listen to the answer. It's the fastest way to learn.  If you enjoy doing diy or home improvement projects you will enjoy working here.  You get to hear about the projects people do and a lot of times they will show you the end result."
good,"excellent work place they provide benefits, health care ,and also provide a lot of ways to move forward in the company. overall its a nice place to work"
good,Overall it’s a nice place to work at. Everyone is helpful and friendly. They often provide free meals and even have company parties. They really teach you a lot and help you grow in the company.
good,"This job was a traveling job, full of adventure. Work started at 11:00p.m. and ended around 7-7:30 every morning. Mainly we replaced old isle structures and displays for the new."
good,worked as a cashier greeted guests rung up items and took payments and processed returns rotate different departments like paint home lawn and garden .
good,It had its ups and downs but I enjoyed working or them. Great people. Good environment. Very fun. They would start off their days with a team meeting. We would discuss the goals for each day. I learned a ton about customer satisfaction. Management was very understanding for the most part. The workplace was very fast-paced but ran smoothly 9/10 times. The hardest part was dealing with angry customers.
good,"A typical work day would start with making sure our departments are neat and clean with shelves fully stocked ready to provide great customer service, proceeding with assisting customers and other associates. We learned about each product in our department allowing us to provide accurate information to our customers. The workplace environment was full of determined and hard working associates.

good,"A typical day would include restocking and customer service"
good,"working for homedepot is a stable job and you will know what your job is on a regular basis.  however i do not recommend going in with a career in mind.  compensation is slow to grow, and you will spend a large portion of your time dealing with difficult people and situations, so you will rarely feel properly compensated."
good,I loved the work environment but I felt like I was stuck in my position with no chance of position change or advancement. My coworkers were kind people and most customers were a joy to work with.

good,I like working with my fellow employees. I like helping the customers and solving there problems. The management is helpful and encouraging. The training is very helpful.
good,"tasks are usually simple, once in a while unusual tasks come up but many resources to teach you new things. Book keeping department is usually repetetive, not too much opportunity for advancement unless you work in a different department."
good,decent place to work if you dont mind working in customer service. Learned a lot about home improvement. management was fine. family style workplace. hardest part was customer service. love the people i work with
good,"my review of the company goes as following"
good,Learned a lot working in the garden department.  It was physically demanding at times and boring at others.  Overall it was an enjoyable experience and I recommend it as a part time job.
good,I was the opener for home depot. Flooring and gardening  department. Enjoyed the accountability..   learned a lot about flooring and gardening process and product. As well as getting certified for machinery such as forklift.
good,I enjoyed my time working at The Home Depot.  They require you to show interest in being successful before they really embrace you but once you get in the companies good graces they do really look out for you.  It's the type of place where having the right attitude goes a long way.
good,A typical day at Home Depot it was always something to do or learn so it always had you on your toes. When coming to work at Home Depot there was new always something new to learn or a new product we had to learn and know about to sell to the customers. Working at Home Depot was one of the best jobs I had because it was always a learning experience and I love the customers and the people I worked with it was really great.
good,"Home Depot (Danbury, CT) was a good place to work. I learned a lot about the retail business, especially with regard to home improvement and construction projects."
good,"I really enjoyed my time with the company.  The work was physical and fast-paced, but it made the day just fly by.  They treat their associates extremely well and promote a positive culture."
good,its good but most times its annoying because of the angry customers and sometimes were bored. Sometimes I feel like I should just leave but I don't know what holding me back
good,My morning started with communicating with my waterers to make sure how things are moving along for the product. Then checking in with managers with make sure sale items are labeled and marked and are neat and presentable for customers. One of the hardest points of the day was the simplest things like moving pallets of plants if there was not any jacks available. Also finding sign holders which were always short handed of. I learned most importantly that communication was the biggest deals of that job in particular.
good,"The job is fast paced, but it can be fun if you allow it to be. The interaction with the public is great, and it's right down your alley if you're a ""people person"". At present, the supervisor is great, and I hope it doesn't change for awhile."

good,"I like to move around, Be involved with more interaction with Customers. Lead Generator position was dismissed. became cashier. I work Part-time works well for me."
good,"My time here has been great so far. I knew what type of job this was and I didn't expect to make a whole lot but at the same time I didn't know what to expect. Overall it's great and I've advanced quite fast within the company. A typical day is punching in and assisting someone as soon as I walk through the aisles. Everyday I learn more about product and the different types of specialties we offer to the customers. The management is great overall and they are very helpful and make it feel that it is okay to ask any questions. It can often be a fast paced environment, and if it's not there's always something to do in order to keep busy. I would have to say that the most difficult part has to be dealing with some of the customers that I have had. It doesn't happen too often, but there have been times where I have been sexullay harassed by male customers and it's always a baffling situation and it's extremely embarrassing and degrading. You would think that by now people are accustomed to that fact that women also work in home improvement stores and we also need to be respected. What do you even say to those types of customers? I for one tell them to please leave me alone or I'll be forced to call security or management. But what about the younger female associates that don't know what to do? Like I said this doesn't happen too often but it still happens. Overall the most enjoyable part of the job has to be helping customers."
good,"The Home Depot was an enjoyable working experience. Easy to pick up hours from co-workers, customers are appreciative and grateful, and pay is descent."

good,good company to work for. great associates. online training can be lengthy. clean and friendly environment. lots of senior management that are very knowledgeable.
good,"I helped out more on customer service. I did a lot of interpreting, as well as cashier work. I helped in all departments, I stocked, also helped in inventory."
good,I liked working there it was just a temp assignment and they always laid us off but they also  would call us back to work. I would go back to work there if I was given a opportunity.
good,sometimes there will be no one in the store and sometimes the store will be packed. you can never find anyone to help and management expects you to know and do everything
good,"Good company to work for. Care about employees and family. Benefits, compinsation, associates first. Always putting you before the management. Pay and Benifits"
good,"They were understaffed when i was working there so i was asked to do more than usally,                   "
good,"A typical day would be a fast paced day helping customers. There weren't really any hard parts about the job , everything is pretty much common sense."

good,Working at Home Depot is actually so much fun. You learn so much everyday and your co-workers are like your best friends from date one. Management is so easy to talk to as well and it's a great place to work!
good,"My experience at the Home Depot overall has been a great experience; I, however, was a little disenchanted with the fact that there was very little room for internal professional growth. New Assistant Management are usually hired from other institutions and aren't used to the Home Depot's policies or ethics. As an employee who has management experience from other companies it is very alarming that the a company would hire someone that is accustomed to culture or environment that is the Home Depot."
good,"I enjoyed working for Home Depot, the management helped me to strive and do better for myself. I learned a lot about warehouse shipping and receiving procedures."

good,"I loved my time at The Home Depot. I worked a customer service representative. I helped customer with special order door, garages, tubs , toilets, sinks etc. At my time of employment, I learned about all of the departments in the store which helped me still to this day in my own home."
good,"It was moving day and it became a productive day, it felt like it was hard until I stopped and told myself to plan and organize the task that I'm trying to do. I learned it'll work out better that way than to just move and place things anywhere. My workspace culture was my family and that made it enjoyable."
good,"working as the receiving superviser was very strainouse both mentally and physical, and also everything that came to the store or shipped out i was responsible for physically and paperwork wise. At inventory it was stressful because all material received and shipped paperwork wise had to be maintained by the receiving superviser."
good,It was a good place to work. Pretty fast paced and hard work. A lot of time on your feet and I usually put in 10 miles a day. The management team was really good.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of checking customers out, assisting with loading customers items into their cars, and rallying carts in the parking lot. I learned to talk to customers and become more sociable with strangers. The management was often friendly and supportive. The workplace culture consisted of mostly friendly customers and associates with some instances of less than friendly customers and grouchy employees. The hardest part of the job was having to stand around and wait for customers to check-out. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with friendly associates and meeting the customers."

good,The Home Depot is very flexible for part timers (many of which are in school). They have many options to move up on their corporate ladder and have many benefits.
good,It is Really task and customer service based work. Customers come first and then depending on the time of year your tasks may change from Packing up the last seasons products and merchandising the current seasons products. There is always something to do  wether it be replenishing stock or simply cleaning up the department and if you have completed things in your own department there is always someone else to assist.

good,This was a temp job from the very beginning. I took this job for the money because money was in short supply. Since this was a seasonal job it just didnt last.
good,"typical day, quite easy picks up around noonish get some customers thats friendly then  most,  learned majority about building & installing . management as a group horrible, individually cooler then most"
good,"Home depot is a great place to work they have good pay and benefits, sometimes it can be a fun place to work but lets face it every job needs to be serious sometime. Career advancement was a little slow, managers do not always set goals with yearly review, so employees do not always now where they need work for promotions."

During that time I learned a lot about the different departments within the store and made good friends. The Home Depot is a very established company and makes a good, friendly place to work."
good,home depot is well known and great to work for. they value their hard working employees and see their value. given opportunities to advance and move up is great
good,I worked receiving and I unloaded the truck when it got there. I had about 2 to 4 trucks a week.

Interactions with customers also gave me great experience in learning how to communicate with people and provide the best service possible."
good,I enjoy working with people. I did not like that many times I was left as the MOD when my department was the front end. I also did not like that you would page an associate for a price check and they would not come to the front.
good,"enjor workign with customers/helping them also helping answering questions and getting the job done.ales associates with The Home Depot typically provide customer service, including directing customers to products, answering questions about goods, or assisting in purchase decisions. Home Depot sales associates may also perform stocking, organizing, and cleaning duties at the request of the management team."
good,"The Home Depot is a good place to work, good benefits and flexible hours if your looking for part-time work but full-time positions are hard to come by. You can learn a lot and you can work in many different departments but they will always limit your hours and keep you from overtime pay."

good,"Home Depot Merchandising Execution team is a good job. there are a Day MET team and a Night Met team. The day met team services and maintains the section in each isle for the venders.

good,woking at home depot it can be slow paced and sometimes fast depending on the amount of freight comimg in. the managers and employees are nice willing to lend a hand
good,"One of the most diverse, different types of retail environments I think that there is; not easily described. Rarely dull. Extremely well managed, with great compensation. The most difficult part of the job would be have to be that the pace can sometimes be too fast to properly serve customers. For the most enjoyable part would have to be the plethora of free knowledge and training on a large range of subjects the company provided."
good,"Really easy job. Is fast paced, keeps you busy. Best one I've had so fair. There are many opportunities to learn. Everyone is super nice and everyone works together. You have some bad coworkers but most are great. Management is okay."

good,Resultó una experiencia muy grata y enriquecedora la temporada de apertura hasta llegar a la fecha de apertura. Aprendí mucho sobre cultura laboral y liderazgo
good,Company was a fun environment as long as work was done it was pretty much laid back. Got to talk to people all over the world. Solving customer problems was always a joy. Was sad and disappointed when location had to close down.

good,"I enjoy working with the Home Depot. It is a well balance work place. The company provides medical, dental, and life insurance. They also provide 401K,"
good,Not the best for having a family and/or kids. Can get stuck working a lot of nights and weekends which can cause you to miss your kids growing up.Can close one night and open the store up the very next morning. Can be under scheduled during busy times and managers not helping out.
good,"It had great benefits, part time for half of what full time received.  Lots of learning and classes.  I did hear they now only hire temporary, hopefully it's not true.  But I had a lot of fun here"
good,"great fun job, with lots of client services, events have big impact on the community and bring high spirit to the job with safety in regards to events staff and personal and people attending the event"
good,Home Depot often strived for the great culture by putting associates first. Wearing orange created a tie and all the workers present would be kind curtious and respectful. The only issues rose in management and training; much of it was computer based and the managers at this particular store were number oriented.
good,I enjoyed my time working at home depot although I might not have worked there long. The time of four months that i did work there I learned how to communicat with people more that I thought I would.
good,It was a good company to work for. They had a 401k and competitive benefits.  I enjoyed the challenge of making a reality of the idea a customer would have to build or add to their home.
good,"The work culture and coworkers at the home depot it the best part of working there. Everyone one is fun and very helpful to new comers."
good,It was a nice job for the time being but that wanted me to work over night which was impossible to me because I ride the bus. I really liked the job but it just wasn’t gonna work for my schedule because I either get a ride with my dad or take the bus. I can work pretty much all hours of the day just not at night.
good,good place to work. Management treats every employee good. I would recommend this type of work to anyone that wants to sharpen their skills in customer service and products
good,Spent 21 yrs with the company. Was at various times department head of many departments. Was an assistant manager for three years until I decided not to persue management. Was receiving associate for last 6 yrs till I retired. Overall it was a good place to work. Some small problems as you would find in any company but enjoyed my time there.
good,The work environment is laid back but can also be challenging which is okay and I like. The co-workers are awesome to work with and make it easier to get through a shift with.
good,"A typical day at home Depot would begin with a short 15 Minute ride to work. Say hi to anyone in the break room, put my apron on and then I'd clock in. Always found a way to stay busy helping customers or stocking. I honestly did learn a good amount about a lot of hand on things. Most enjoyable part was honestly lunch time."
good,Easy and great place to work. opportunities to move up are there and fair.. no complaints. wouldn't change what I learned at Home Depot.. learned a lot

good,"was very fast paced and challenging, I learn new management skills on a daily basis. it was fun dealing with different customers daily. had good support from the management team"
good,Its ok. Its fine. Most people that I work with and for are awesome. Most customers are very friendly and we are called on by first name basics. Some customers are there 3 and 4 times a day. Those are my favorite.
good,Homedepot is a very good place to learn about management. Very fast paced and you learn a lot about management and household things. The hardest part is being about to take on multiple department by yourself but its very fun and tiring but you get to learn a lot about other stuff and able to learn from it.
good,"This was a very good company to work for. We worked hard but had fun doing it. The benefits offered were fair. Incentives were given when earned, which I did often."

good,it was a good job easy work they where fair. we had another work fores in the building there where not that fun to work for they seemed there where more focused on there work then being making the plack a better work place
good,"working with contractors to make orders on certain products that werent available on site, pulling orders and directing customers to proper areas, also jumped on register to cash out customers when was short handed on cashiers"
good,"Very busy, fast paced, in charge -as Pro Sales Rep for Lumber Dept.Those of us that worked hard had to make up for those who slacked off, and there were many who slacked off. I am a conscientious employee who takes his job seriously and those who didn't take it seriously hurt the company, along with my ability to spend more time focusing on customer service and in building my contractor base."
good,"It's not a fast paced environment, and you don't really need to know much about the things they sell there for this position. In reality what the higher ups want you to be are human advertisers for the store credit line and in store programs. It's not like a regular cashier position where they check your scan times and accuracy but what is far more important is how many credit lines you open up. If you're very good at this then you'll be a perfect employee, you can mess up plenty of time and be slow if you want. Its not necessarily a bad thing but if you're expecting to just be a regular cashier its best to look somewhere else since this position does require you to be good at opening credit lines."
good,"It was an okay job for a college student. I left because they don't have advancement opportunity for someone working part time. They only promote someones who is full-time, worked there for years, I never saw anyone under 40 in a management position."
good,"fast paced but if you are willing to work hard there is advancement great benefits but there are a lot of changes happening in the top positions that could impact the company long term ,"
good,"Excellent managers, they take the time to teach you all the necessary tools you need to complete your tasks safe and efficiently. Also make work go by with ease."
good,"The Home Depot has great benefits and job security. It pays decent for its basic positions but in order to make significantly more or advance in the company you must be willing to work ridiculous hours at low pay, varying schedule, and high stress. It takes a special kind of person to make a career out of Home Depot. It can take an entire life time to reach a position with a ""comfortable"" salary if one isn't willing to go the extra mile and then some."
good,"Working at the home depot was a little like working at Walmart, only more expensive. Even though I was just a cashier, I still sometimes walked away to help people, but only by a few feet so I wouldn't get in trouble"
good,The people at the home depot store I work at were friendly and helpful.  The culture was the same way never had any problems working at home depot. The customer were usually friendly as well.  I don't know how it is at the other home depot stores but the one I work at was pleasant I like working for home depot they are fair to me.
good,friendly environment. everybody gets along. good training. and opportunity to move up in company. I would come in to work check store numbers. check the department. meet with staff.

good,I liked working there. It fit my family schedule nicely when I was a stay at home dad. It was the perfect part time job. And eventually that led into a full time position as a department head.
good,The last year has been the hardest year for me emotionally and mentally on a personal level so a lot of the passive energy I get from my manger has moved me to Want better from my next employer and has also moved me to leave the company all together
good,Working as a merchandiser for The Home Depot is a very structured and fast paced work environment that's ever changing with projects and customer service blended in. The benefits are quite nice compared to most retail establishments and having a schedule that never changes every week allows me to have a social life outside of work.
good,I enjoyed working at Home Depot but resigned because young supervisor denied time off I had requested more than a month in advance to perform my required duties as Palm Beach County Clerk at precinct.  I was only working a few hours and did not want to create problem for supervisor although I was allowed to remain employed.
good,"Continued growth for advancement opportunities. Customer focused environment and a specialist in the retail industry, Satisfaction to assist with customer needs."
good,"Night shift at Home Depot has good pay and management, however culture is bland, or essentially non existent. For a temporary job, it is quite desirable."
good,I personally loved working there and would work there again if possible its a great enviorment and great people the energy and vibe is great most of all the supervisors and managers are always there to help with everything and anything
good,"Started out in receiving and it is very easy. Just unloading freight, stack pallets, down pack freight for night crew onto carts for different departments. Must put your foot down in receiving or other people will walk all over you."
good,The company is very organized which can make a typical workday somewhat fast-paced. The one thing to mindful of is you might be on your feet a majority of your shift
good,great place to work worked on the overnight freight team then moved to the receiving deparment love the monday  to friday shift week ends off which was great and to me really there where no hard parts of the job i enjoyed it
good,"The work is hard and demanding, the pay is low, but there is a potential to advance. If you are a good worker they can train you to operate equipment.  The management is fair, It is work and it pay better then many in this field.  If you can work in a specialty department the pay improves."
good,A work day was helping people and keeping the store stocked.  The management was good.  They were there to help.  They were willing to help with any job you wanted.
good,Good place and environment to grow. They hire people of all sorts and walks of life .. this is a great diverse work place. Helping trouble shoot people's DYI  home questions is fun
good,"It was my first job. I was proud to work there; eventhough, the pay was not sufficient. I got along well with everyone, and customers recognized me on the daily basis. The hardest part of the job was busy days when the lines were long, and the occasional criminals who tried to steal things in their shopping baskets made the job a little hectic. Nevertheless, it was a great experience. I learned a lot about working in retail."
good,"I loved working on the MET Team.  I enjoyed the schedule for the positions.  My position did price changes the first 4 hours while other did resets.  After that, we did bay maintenance and reset to plan-o-grams.  I'm meticulous and love the detail work.  It was physical and I was on my feet most of the day.  I was able to drop my gym membership.  I became certified on the electric ladder and was working on other certifications."
good,It has been a lot of fun working here at the home depot - there is a lot of change at the company due the changing business requirements and online competion. But Home Depot has top senior management
good,"You are required to work hard,to be a self starter.. And customer service is number one.. Saftey is also hign on the list.. And on going training is also a plus."
good,Good place to work. Schedule and tasks varied daily which was a plus for me. Wish the schedule had been full time or at least more consistent number of hours.
good,"great company to work for, you will never be bored as there is a lot of product to stock on the overnight freight team. you will meet a lot of wonderful people."
good,A typical day at work at Home Depot really varied because it could be fast paced one minute and then the next it could be slowed down; but for the most part it was fast paced which i really enjoyed it made the time go by fast.
good,a typical day at work was taking calls at a fast paced time. the most enjoyable part was the people worked with. management does tend to the needs to help improve your call taking.
good,"For a retail company the associates are well paid above minimum wage.  They offer benefits and 401 K.  Bonuses were given to the employees when sales, customer surveys, and credit met company standards."
good,Over all working here was great and the people are there to help you. Never have to look so far for something when the company computer is there to help when no one else is able to making it a self service as well.
good,"The Home Depot was a great place to work. Met a lot of great people, learn a lot about the aspects of a business such as, merchandising, people skills, marketing, operations, career advancement and etc. Did a lot of volunteer work and helped the people of our community."
good,"Decent Job, the hours were the hardest part of the job. Expected to be at work by 5 am and stay til 2. Very hard to adjust to, but overall job quality is great."
good,Learned to appreciate customers. Profit sharing. Sometimes difficult to receive help from other employees. Management always puts bonuses back into store to boost teamwork.
good,"poorly paid employee associates created high turnover and poor customer service experience"
good,"Cashier, customer assistance, shift lead, closing down front-end, counting down cash tills, resolving customer complaints and assisted with training of new cashiers"
good,"Good place to work so far. I've only been with them, a month, so I can't give too much information. But so far it is a good place to place to work at."
good,Depending on job position hours might be limited. Good for Part-time as limited benefits are offered. Depending on shift or manager might get free food or holiday parties.
good,"Lots of customer interaction, promoting from within, ability to learn lots of new things in regards to home improvement. Great training and starting salary."

good,"Not willing to take time out to help associates  career growth, I seen managers hired from external source instead of hiring with in and I believe that unfair since there are qualified associates."
good,"Coming from another big box retailer, I enjoy what THD has to offer. My regret is not joining sooner when offered a job. With the new policy changes in AP, it does make the job harder and less rewarding."

I like working with people  and during my time at The Home Depot I have worked  3 department's  all of which  are  customer service based ,they  were customer care desk, appliance sales associate and  pro sales associate (saling to contractors, big and small businesses).

good,"I down stocked with the order picker and reach truck. Front and faced the store. Researched appliances to find the best one for my customer. Learned about plumbing so I was able to assist customers more efficiently. Apprenticed to learn about countertops so I was able to help my coworkers. When you are hired you are informed of a no tardy policy. Management told me it fell off my record every six months. They neglected to tell me that if you are written up then all of your tardies follow you for an additional six months. Once you receive your second final if you have one tardy, they terminate you. I loved working there I had plenty to keep myself busy. It had a good mix of hard work and customer service. They always made sure you did not have to always worry about food."

good,"The Home Depot is a fun productive work place, you are able to interact with customers and share you thought and ideas with  others associates.

good,I'm a cashier and the job is rewarding. they are extremely flexible with working with your schedule as most employees work here for a part time job. You are required to work a weekend. And they do require that you push for credit cards.  There is potential for growth but you have to have a couple of years under your belt to be considered. The do provide vision benefits and 401k even if you're part time.
good,"I love working for Home Depot it a fun and productive place to work, but for some position you don't get a fair pay for what you have to do and deal with."

good,"la empresa es muy buena, y tiene buenos beneficios."
good,"Aprendí socializar con mucha gente , y tener  el apoyo de gerencia en todo momento"
good,they started buy giving you hours for like a month but after that I only worked like three days five hours a day . then once later that next month I did not get any hours only 3 hours in a week
good,This is a good job for someone in college looking to make money and learn a new skill. Home Depot offers incentives to move up within the company and will help you pay for school to do so
good,Working at Home Depot is fairly average as far as retail positions go. Although I will say that you are provided with plenty of opportunities to learn valuable life skills if you pay attention.
good,Home Depot was a great experience for me. Working in the lumber department really helped me expand my knowledge on how to build and maintain projects with wood.
good,My manager at The Home Depot was great. He took the time to explain the various products and there functions. The typical day at Home Depot was fun and full of unique customers.
good,This is a great job with alot to offer it just takes alot to get what you want. It's hard to advance in this company it can be very cut throat. alot of competion.
good,"nice job culture, supportive management, co workers were awesome and helped in every aspect, good training programs to help us grow and succeed. fun place to work."
good,Offers the opportunity to learn great new skills to help in household maintenance and the opportunity to get hands on experience with the products. Certifies employees in the use of forklifts and other heavy machinery.
good,Home Depot is a better-than-average company to work for. They have stringent safety standards.  The workload is generally light considering the industry.  Company policies are average in efficiency and the company management has an attitude that will not allow Home Depot to achieve ultimate efficiency
good,"After the 2 founders left,  Bernard Marcus and  Arthur Blank the culture changed to a true ""Big Box"" mentality and became a less desirable place to work because the atmosphere had changed so...more for less so to speak,high turnover rate and the older management IE: well paid ...  was forced out and the customer paid the price. It was sad for me to watch after devoting 15+ years so I left and started my own business "
good,"The work was stressful and fast-paced, but enjoyable. Coworkers were friendly and patient as I tried to learn all the ins and outs of the computer system."
good,"hard on salary management but great to hourly associates.  They treat hourly associates fairly and compensate decently.  fast paced work enviroment, training is weak.  Need to be a quick learner."
good,It was a fast pace business I learned  a lot things and I  met a lot of nice people. Family oriented and I had a great supervisor and hopefully my daughter get's a chance to work there.
good,"great place too work"
good,Small company feel.  I enjoyed my time there.  I worked in the Distribution Center with a team of hard workers that liked to get it done.  Good times.
good,this place was so unorganized and the supervision was awful. they have changed a lot since i been there it was not a great place to work then. My review is really irrelevant because they have changed a lot of things since then i don't know if its better or worse
good,I had a wonderful environment and was paid reasonably for the cost of the living expenses my wife and I had. It pays when you have the right manager and crew. I believe this is a big part in home depot's agenda in being a great store. My experience as an employee plays a big part in why I am a customer.
good,"Very flexible with school scheduling, and as long as you're not afraid to work and do your job, you'll do fine. Depending on the store you are in and management, getting full time/pay raises can be a challenge."
good,"Administration (included but not limited to): Reconciliation of various accounts, preparation of payroll, and inventory of supplies. Maintaining databases and creating spreadsheets. Cost analysis and budgetary recommendations."
good,"Typical was fast - pace. I learned about lumber; painting and flooring materials. Being part of the management team I was able to stay up to date with new company information."
good,"Great place to work different hours and shifts. Room for growth in different departments within the company. "
good,Working at night was an interesting experience but not much more than that. i will finish this review because if i dont i wont be able to continure on.
good,It was a very great experience work place  I really like the environment they have cheap prices the associates are very nice people  Great place......
good,un buen trabajo con muy buenos empleados ya que todos trabajan en equipo y con una gran cordinacion lo que hace que el trabajo sea mas facil
good,Great place to work and great benefits in the sales associate field. They do alot of things for their employees to make the work environment fun and different. If you don't mind a little hard work and various hour then this might be the career for you.
good,Great place to start working. If you love the home improvement lifestyle then this is the place to work. The pay is not great and customers can be very nice to employess.
good,"Working at Home depot taught me a lot of things. It usually stayed busy at all hours, but a little slower at night. Weekends are crazy, and the hardest part was trying to work the service desk by yourself if you were understaffed."
good,Been a while since i worked there but it was a good place enjoyed the people i worked with mind you i worked overnight .. So yes i would recommend  working here
good,didnt get to grow with the comapny but from the short time there it was a fun fast enviroment. Majority of customers know what they are in for which makes the transactions go fast
good,There's a lot of opportunities at the Home Depot. You'll learn a lot on home improvement from the store and customers as well. Everyone is friendly and work as a team.
good,The job at times was stressful but it made time go by much faster. Typically on the weekends all of the cashier registers will be open and you have to manage your time wisely. Time management is key in order to run the front end especially when supervising the cashiers and determining their lunch and break times.
good,"Great place to work and company takes care of the associates. "
good,My manager was not good all other aspects of the job were good a solid working enviroment. Safety is Big here and rightfully so.  working with the public is challenging from time to time but it all works out.
good,The experience at the home depot is the best I've ever had. Had on of the best trainers. the customers are the best part of the job. I learned each and every department. There's nothing you can ask me and I wont know the answer. Determination is one of my best qualities.
good,typical warehouse hardware store. great career advancements available. good hours. very boring if cashier and slow. customers arent the friendliest but helps you be better
good,"in order to start one has to work hard,make progress to prove themselves for a better opportunity. I made friends at the store and its a team environment"
good,its short staff once and a while and its not good since its always a busy place. Sometimes some employers magically disappear which is common. one thing i like about the home depot it provides with what ever tool you in to get the job
good,Nice folks to work with but not enough money for the amount of heavy lifting and amount of tasks required. Close to slave labor. Very difficult to get full time or a decent wage increase. Some folks work there years only getting .25 extra.
good,I work many different department. I was a lumber cashier and a returns cashier and then I went to the MET Team. But over all it was a very busy place to work. I learned many different things about home repair and  customer service.
good,Worked in Corporate office in Atlanta GA and transferred to Store in Houston. great advancement opportunities and perks. the stock option was best for me.
good,"I learned a lot of various work skills at this job, but the management style at times made me feel like I was back in high school and you were either part of the ""in"" crowd or not. Not professional."
good,"I highly recommend working here if your just starting the work filed but not anyone with long term career plans. The people i worked with were all cool but management was a mess, scheduling was a mess, there was no good coverage. The management team let customers get away with murder..."
good,Help people load and unload. how to cut wood and sell grass seeds to people. Management was cool. The culture was cool. The hardest part was trying to cut carpet . Clocking out
good,"I love working with my coworkers, their very helpful and understanding. My managers are also always available to speak and get your point across. The customers are very nasty only think i don't like about the job."
good,"At first I did have trouble just adapting to the type of work that I was doing.  Maybe it was because prior to this one I didn't have a sustaining job since getting let go at New York Community Bank in 2014.  It took a while for me to adapt, but I always worked as hard as I could.  After a while, I had gotten used to it and when I do that I was motivated to do the job to the best of my abilities.  The people there I did have a hard time getting along with, but when I looked deep into who they are they weren't bad people.  There were some good moments and bad moments.  Either way this job was an experience.  I learned a lot."
good,"Good job overall. Be prepared for long hours and to be hot during the warmer months. Work conditions were good, and the breaks were 20 minutes a piece which was nice during a 10 hour day."
good,Being a Home Depot employee for the past two years has been nothing short of an eye opening experience. I do and always will love the values that the company upholds through their employees because that is the right way to do things and I love that the management takes time out of their days and lives to get to know their employees.
good,"Non stop on the floor with Exemplary customer service. You need to be able to multi task. The best part is being the problem solver and the pride you take at your work location. Assisting others who may not have my knowledge by teaching them hands on.  Also, although I have a long background in the Home Depot and Military service, I always manage to learn something new.  Treat all associates alike and fairly at all times!"
good,Observe cashier behaviors and ensure they are driving the customer experience.  Assist with issues and complaints.  Perform price checks on merchandise as needed.  Ensure execution of all company operating procedures.  Ensure all cashiers are knowledgeable.  Promote customer awareness and involvement in Home Depot programs such as the Home Depot Credit Card and Home Depot Protection Plans.  Hardest part of the job is ensuring the customers are paying for all purchases. Most enjoyable is meeting great people.
good,.  It can be hectic but I can handle it.  I like staying busy. Most of the managers are good to work for.  I have learned a lot there.  The only thing is that I usually work my whole 8 hours by myself without any help.
good,This company is mostly suited for students and people that want to learn and develop their business skills. The managers tend to work with people's school schedules.
good,Great company to work for very physical job. Lots of room for advancement. A very caring management team. Lots of perks based on the work force doing there jobs .
good,"Great place to work! If you are looking for a nice place to work, Home Depot is it. Just go to careers.com and apply. They offer day shifts, night shifts."
good,"This was a fun position and very educational. Employees can be trained in multiple departments and equipment as desired or needed."
good,"Home Depot  was a great place to work. I like the fact that we was able to help people that was in need o help. We were able to give back to the community in so many ways. The train I received was great and very completive. "
good,A typical work day at Home Depot consist of providing excellent customer service. I have learned a lot about the company and products. The hardest part about the job is calming down an angry customer.
good,"Good place and chilled people."
good,"-busy days "
good,Everyday was different.  I stocked shelves and relabeled merchandise.   I worked with assisting customers on a daily basis.  We took care of inventory and etc.  I love working with the public.
good,"I was in charge of designing frameworks for full Automation Suite for HomeDepot e-commerce space. "
good,Good job to work at if looking for a flexible schedule. Customers and staff are very friendly. A great place that offers a lot of benefits and discounts.
good,"work in all departments keeps u busy -can volunteer to help in community events like Habit houses, parks, raising money for select causes. Plus give to employee fund that provides assistance to employees"
good,"I feel this,was a great customer service type job where i would interact with customers and help them with thete home improvement needs,also learned alot with forklifts and cherry pickers"
good,"All one needs to do is be a good employee and you are treated like family. A good company with great values and good people. That's the ""orange life""."
good,A good place to work. work as a team to get it down. there is a lot of work to. it keep you busy. Made a lot of friends and enjoyed to work there. I learned a lot of things.
good,"El empleo era algo tedioso ya que diario era la misma rutina y los gerentes de la misma tenían un carácter algo especial, no era malo del todo ya que aprendí muchas cosas, a relacionarme con mucha gente, acomodar la mercancía de acuerdo al peso, conocí diversos puntos de la ciudad y sobre todo hice muy buenas amistades."
good,"i work morning, i would have to stock. i love to organize things and i enjoyed having to locate an item. i took it as challenge. i would recommended it to my friends"
good,"Everyone that worked here was very friendly and willing to help with just about anything you need.  Management always had an open door to employees and would discuss any problems you could possibly have, which for many employees was very few."
good,"Giving back is what the company is about! Being part of a team who values our veterans and customers leaves you feeling fulfilled. We don't just build goals, we see them through."
good,Great place to challenge yourself and advance your job title quickly if you give it 110%. Some of the management showed favoritism and it was obvious many of the employees were having relations with each other. Would return if some of the management werent there or if there were more employees that focused on the job instead of whos doing what with who.
good,The people at The Home Depot are fun and outgoing. They have parties for their employees and show that they really appreciate hard work that is put into The Home Depot. Training is very extensive and they make sure that you are ready for the job before just throwing you out on the floor. Safety is number one importance at The Home Depot and there is a safety quiz every month that you are required to take.
good,"una empresa donde se aprende mucho sobre soluciones para el hogar, los jefes se preocupan por el bienestar de cada uno de los asociados, los compañeros de trabajo crean un ambiente laboral donde se puede trabajar con dinamismo todo el dia y asi el dia no se hace monótono. Lo difícil del trabajo es tratar con clientes molestos que no han sido atendidos de forma correcta y su enojo complica las cosas, lo mas agradable del trabajo es que cada semana se reconocen los esfuerzos de cada asociado en una junta con bocadillos."
good,Good management team and CEO.  We were moved out of the corporate building which changed a lot of the moral.  I've learned a lot and the most enjoyable part of the job is working from home
good,Work is hard and pay isn't as good as it should be for the amount of work unless you are management. Most employees are friendly and open. The best part of the job is the satisfaction received from helping a customer.
good,"Great environment , especially for your first job. Quick pace and very customer friendly. mVery motivated management team, that makes employees feel empowered."
good,"Love working there, awesome employees and management is great and very flexible. Pay for my store isn't great but overall love it here you learn so much and have chance for advancement, very flexible schedule."
good,Decent place to work but not enough help.  You are expected to handle whole department by yourself...at times I was trying to help up to 10 people at once plus answer phones.  Supervisor's were great but corporate would not let them jire enough people.
good,Is a fast-growing company so you must always stand at attention to keep up with the high demands of customers. Very friendly environment. And no your product so you can better help customers
good,"Homedepot has a great culture, just looking for full time employment and higher pay, when I was hired everybody welcomed me and made me feel welcome, its a good place to work."
good,"Great place to have worked, My biggest regret is that they are not able to offer steady hours year round.  Management unfortunately changes a lot through the years."
good,They genuinely seem to care about you as a person. Higher staff ask you how you are on a personal level!!! They knew I was going through personal stuff and allowed me to take the time off when I needed to.
good,"Company is dedicated to customer satisfaction, and employee improvement, thru extensive training, community involvement & volunteering, self-help programs."
good,This was one of the better places that I have worked at .  Only problem is I had one the upper management people on my rear all of time and it was embarrassing
good,"Management could be better and the work load can be very stressful, but with the right team and people, the night goes by relatively quickly. The job is difficult and will always be difficult, but the friends that are made there tend to make it a little easier. Learning is part of the job everyday and every night. There is never a chance where you are not learning something new and how to improve on the skill that you've learned."
good,Lots of opportunity for variety in job positions. I've been able to transfer smoothly to another state and move to various positions within the company.
good,Managed accounts with general contractors to make sure all materials were staged and delivered in a timely manner.Made sure communication was my top priority.Double checked all quotes for errors before presenting them to my customers.I really enjoyed meeting people and assisting them for what was needed for there home improvement projects and getting a big thank you for my help.
good,"Bottom line is Home Depot is a great company to work for especially if you're a student or just starting out in the workforce. Great training and you genuinely learn a lot of life skills. The environment can be great but it does depend on your attitude and your ability to stay away from gossip."
good,"Quite a lot is expected of you for $10.00 an hour, but relative to other jobs, it's not bad at all. At my store, we are like family and people are very kind to each other. There is very little to no gossip, which I find to be a huge plus.   I hear other stores are different, so it depends on the location."
good,"The pay stinks and raises are only once a year and are in .10 increments which is a joke, I did however enjoy my co-workers and working with the public and operating the lift equipment."
good,Mi tiempo laborado fue excelente en el lugar un ambiente de lo mas genial la cuestionson los lideres que aveces tiene no sirve de mucho un persona que imponga en lugar de que enseñe
good,"the home depot is a great company to work for, they have great benefits, the work environment is great and they have sucess sharing which is great! the bad is management can be a little tricky and they sometimes have unrealistic goals and demands for their associates other than that i enjoy working here."
good,Really good company to connect with an stay with. They take real good care of you if you stay with the company. It's not the easiest to move up in or get a raise.
good,The day starts with walking the department to see if any products on the shelf need to be restocked. Sales are vitally important in retail. Work with customers who need product knowledge to make an informed decision of correct product to perform a job or project working on. Great interaction building rapport with customers is a must. Asking lower and higher order questions to get a clear understanding of the need of customer. Once day is over. Make sure the replenishment of the inventory is addressed to have product in retail to meet ongoing needs of product in demand.
good,"Great place to work, with a good co workers. Hours were flexable, with great benefits including health, dental, vision, and paid time off for sick or vacation."
good,"I would recommend this place of employment to anyone who is retired and needs to make some money on the side or a young teen as a first job. You learn important customer service skills, time management skills and you have the opportunity to build sales experience. They offer great benefits. I miss working there because fellow coworkers were like family, very loving, fun environment."
good,"Fun work place with amazing other emplyees.  Supervisors were easy to get along with and worked with you to schedule your work hours needed. There was a lot to learn about the different areas of the store. This is one of the hardest of your job. I enjoyed meeting a verity of customers."
good,"Great Management, Family Type Atmosphere, Good part time hours. Hardest part of the job is working nights and weekends. Most enjoyable part of the job are the people and the Home Depot family."
good,Fun workplace . Provides you the opportunity to learn a wide variety of information due to the numerous services they provide . Balanced and fun work environment for all the employees
good,"waiting on customers, making the sale that provides everything the customer needs in order to do the job. Weather it is gardening or building a home or just a repair."
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work when the right managers are put into place. The benefits are excellent. Vacation and holiday pay is awesome. You have to be willing to change for our world is at a high pace changing, Computer  & Smartphone knowledge is needed."
good,"The home depot is a great work environment to be apart of. However,  they make it incredibly hard to move up in the company and to change departments."
good,I traveled to many new places in the area and learned a lot about their products and work environment overnight. In a way you get more out of the job than what you put in. Cool job overall.
good,"Overall, a great experience working for this company.  Great benefits, including paid vacation, health insurance and 401(k) plan.  I had the opportunity to grow with the company during my time there."
good,"I moved from Houston to Huntsville after attending college there and this job allowed me to live in a nice apartment that I enjoyed very much! This was a sort of legacy job for me because my father retired from The Home Depot in 2005, and he worked in the electrical department just like I did!"
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work due to their commitment to diversity, work life balance and culture. Positions are challenging and designed to promote internal growth and success."
good,"Most of my time would be taken up by keeping theshopping carts out of the parking lot and stacked together for use for the customers. The rest of the time was used assisting customers load or unload products. There are also times my supervisor would task me with refilling the beverage coolers for customers. "
good,Mostly all GREAT people to work with!! My tasks and projects are fun and rewarding.  Most customers are great...great experiences with them....problem solving...smiling..laughing...selling...Its all been fun and rewarding. Management is mostly relaxed and fun to work with.  People that visit from other stores are also fun to meet and often very supportive and encouraging! Can you tell? I really like my job at THD
good,"Being a department supervisor, you are required to be available when others in your department are not, as well as when you are short handed. The schedule is different almost every week and you are not guaranteed certain shifts. Mostly department supervisors work a few day shifts, and a few closing shifts each week. There are also a couple of times a year that you are required to work overnights to complete overhead organization."
good,A typical day at work is very fast pace and lots of merchandise to be put in correct order. I learned the different departments and where things are and how the different merchandises work and for what. It's a very muti-cultural workplace.
good,"Me gusta el formato de la empresa, tiene puntos buenos en cuanto al apoyo a sus asociados."
good,"My main goal as a CS , was to make sure all my customers would leave with their purchased item with everything ready to go. I learned that not every customer would approve their items and i needed to find another one ASAP."

good,"- Company is moving to new paradigm of Xtreme Programming that requires Pair programming."
good,Working early in the morning was a great experience. Meeting very new people and customers that are friendly. Workplace environment above average in many ways.
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work if you are in a store that promotes excellent customer service. Unfortunately, some of the stores' management do not foster this environment or require employees to provide excellent customer service, so mistakes are made, customers get upset and complain, employees are ignorant about product knowledge, and employees do not care about their job or other people. Shop as a customer in the store before you decide whether you want to be an employee there."
good,It was an enjoyable work experience. Management was fair in their expectations on the work to be done. I worked at a store with good people so going to work wasn't ever something I feared or dreaded.
good,"Advance quickly by applying as soon as you are eligible.  Trust me, because languishing will result in burnout.  I liked working there until I began to work with some of the more experienced associates.  They tend to look down on Contractors.  So, solution:  apply for their job and move up.  They hire from within which is AWESOME!!"
good,"You wont get weekends off, but the work culture is nice almost like a 2nd family. One of the problems i had in garden was no one wanted to be outside in the Texas heat. being a lot loader i had to be out there and do garden associates job as well as my own."
good,"It's a job, you go, you make money. If you have no problem doing the same task over and over for months, then it is the job for you. "
good,"Home Depot is quite possibly one of the best places I have ever worked even with the compensation starting on the low side. The reason behind this is simple: opportunity. If you are a young person looking to get your foot in the door somewhere, Home Depot is always looking for employees to start from their stores and move up. This is a great quality and feature and if another offer had not come through sooner, I could see myself working at Home Depot corporate."
good,I learned a lot about teamwork and customer service at Home Depot. The management is very customer oriented and my fellow associates are friendly and hardworking. I'm looking forward to using these tools at another great company
good,I am very honored to be part of the Home Depot team for the past 26 months. I have learned alot and met alot of amazing people. The Home Depot is very committed to helping people and honoring our military. The women and kid workshops are such a big hit with the community and the women'workshop helps to drive sales.

good,"The home depot is a fun place to work. You get to learn a lot of new things.The job culture can be more friendly.There are many benefits and perks .No discounts on products, unfortunately ."
good,You are responsible for assisting with problems and concerns of customers. The other employees do not know much about the products and are rarely anywhere to be found when customers need help.
good,You must always be up to date and planning ahead. keeping managers up to date on the upcoming events with vendors. So they can keep the higher managers up to date.  Making sure customers are satisfied with the service they received and if they would recommend our services and/or use them again.
good,Day to day operations at The Home Depot can vary widely due to differences in the arrivals of shipments and customer purchases. You can go from days of non-stop work helping customers to days of mostly stocking and cleaning. The management genuinely cares about employees and customers.
good,"The corporate office made sure that each employee received ample training for all job title.  They are concerned about customer service and desires to keep everyone safe, customers and employees."
good,"As a young adult, it was a great job for me to learn from others. There was great communication and they were very accommodating if I had to take care of something outside of work."
good,"You get dirty and the men can be a tad sexist but overall home depot is a decent place to start. They provide good benefits, the roles all pay above minimum wage, and there is good opportunity to advance."
good,"at the repair center I worked mainly on receiving items needing repair, and once repairs were finished I would process it to be shipped out again. the had daily quotas which were reasonable. They did not micromanage which prevented much stress."
good,The work is easy and the make it a easy going environment. Management is easy to talk to and they treat you as a person not just a number. Everyone is friendly.
good,I'm 17 and work at The Home Depot. Even as a minor there are plenty of opportunities for advancement and pay raises. The 401k is open to enroll in after your 90 day grace period. My only complaint on the company (and it could just be me store) at all is that my hours aren't stable. They promise you an average of 20 hours a weeks but I'm averaging 11 right now and can't pay bills. But I'm currently resolving this issue. Other than that the store is a fun and great place to work for.
good,"Great place to work, great work life balance, good discount, room for advancement, good management, ok pay, good benefits if full time good bonus pay."

good,Much variety as I covered as many as 4 depts. at once ..... gave me good background in additional to the work experience I already had.  Made decisions on my own and could sale off items with customers.  Very good customer service in my areas as well ... received employee of the month 5 times.
good,"Come to work before 8 am. Get apron and keys to start day"
good,"Restocking and maintaining cleanliness of the aisles. Currently learning how to operate a forklift and a reach truck. Acquired the knowledge of using mobile electric ladders. Hardest part of job is having to lift strenuous weigh without proper lift equipment and searching for items in the overheads throughout the store. Most enjoyable part is satisfying the customers needs and the bond with the coworkers. Management is rather helpful, of course there are ones in my opinion that can't handle the pressure but moral support helps get them through some of their more stressful shifts."
good,"The Home Depot is a great place for hard working individuals and those looking for advancement in the retail world. Many opportunities are offered for different learning advancements. Forklift training is provided, as well as online learning in different fields. The managers help with any issue you may have and help you pursue what you're looking for."

good,Everyday you'll be able to learn something new. It was nice to be treated like family for the time I was there. Its a company where if you would like to move up its possible.
good,Very fast past and balanced. Kept you busy and on your feet. Everyone was warmloving and polite. I was always satisfied and content working here with no real live stressors.

From pro to homeowners lots of opportunities to help and learn.  I learned all I know from seeds to fruit trees to lumber and building materials.  A teamwork based store in which all hands are on deck.  The hardest part of the job is to be able to get to all customers needing assistance in a timely matter.  The most enjoyable part of the job is all you learn daily from those you work with and those you encounter daily in an always changing environment.
good,The company on a whole was good. The store manager was a problem.  When a person is really sick and cane not work.  They tell them to come.in.  it is like they don't care.

The management at home depot was great, I got along well with my managers, and they did everything they could to make sure that our jobs were easier.

good,I enjoyed my four years I spent there. i would refer a friend but I wouldn't go back. The store I worked at was successful because everyone worked together.
good,Home Depot is an interesting place to work.  A typical day was driven by a corporate driven action list that had a definite deadline.  This list took a back seat to providing on the spot customer service as you were working the action list.  I learned to prioritize and to be able to switch focus very quickly-and then to resume focus after the customer service was complete.  The hardest part of the job was having split attention.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the daily interactions with the customers.
good,"good environment, pays well, and good benefits. very easy to advance within the company. they keep things interesting and always want the best customer service provided"
good,its good most days but can become over whelming very quickly great group of employees that get along and its fun most days and when we do good as a group they feed us pizza and bbq

good,"The Home Depot has a solid moral compass. They aren't about sacrificing their ethics for the sake of a sale, which I love. They also hire a diverse group of people and give a lot back to the community. They offer a lot of benefits and little treats for their employees. Although they push their associates to meet quota, they're realistic about what can and can't be accomplished."
good,"It was a neat workplace with good hours. I learned how to work in a team environment. The pay was very nice starting at $10/hr. The managers were a little stuck up which was the only downside to an otherwise good job. Hardest part was working in the heat outside, mid summer."
good,"The staff looked after me and I felt a sense of family among them. Everyone got along well and it made the experience  lot more enjoyable. The summer is a busy season and it could get very hot, but that was not too bad. Customers could get testy every now and then but were usually diffused by good workers and management."
good,Home Depot is a great company to work for. You are able to advance within approximately a year. The benefits are good for a full- timer. You will learn a lot from the computer training and also hands on experience.
good,"I have worked for Home Depot since 2008. An It has been a real great experience from customers to associates. Every customer that comes into the Home Depot stores has there own personality form DIY customers to Pro-contractors. An providing great customer services an having great knowledge, on store products for customers needs brings customers right back into Home Depot stores. Making there next shopping experience  more comfortable an more confidence knowing store associates are there to help with there every day home improvement projects."
good,"Walk in, do stretches and talk about HR topics, go to stations and start working. Employees are friendly and easy going. Supervisors are a little more harder to talk to. Their point system for tardy(s) is a little complicated. The hardest part of the job is long hours, always standing and having to lift heavy items. The most enjoyable is their break room."
good,"Overnight shift was allowed overtime hours which was beneficial."
good,Very nice place to work great benefits and they really care for their employees the service desk and the pro desk are kind of stressful but if you have a good team you should be fine
good,"Love working on MET, but under current District Management, I can't afford to.  He agreed to more training in areas that would be helpful to the team and to my future, but after 2 months and additional requests, that has not materialized.  Recently gave reviews and while I received a good review and some positive feedback, the raise was still minimal. I love the set schedule and not having to worry about slow periods and hours being cut and I love the Hoe Depot as a company, but if I can't grow and won't receive appropriate compensation, then there is no reason to stay.  My last raise was 31 cents or 3 percent as an example."
good,I enjoyed my experience at Home Depot very much.  I had a good relationship with the management and learned how to balance life in both work and school.

good,Managment is willing to work with you on your hours and days off.the training on the equietment is very useful.the employees that have been there a while are always helping others.A great place to work and learn about hardware and other departments.
good,GREAT Job. its very possible for someone to move up in the company if you put the time and work in. The managers don't just leave you out there to dry they work while you work so you don't feel like its just someone telling you do this and that. Would recommend this job to anyone.
good,What I enjoyed most was helping customers with their home repair needs. Enjoyed working with most of the coworkers and management. I also enjoyed learning as much as I could about all the different trades they offered improvement items for.
good,Enjoyed working in the Real Estate department for Home Depot that bought and developed the locations where the big box stores where built. Very team orientated and worked in a fast pace office that included legal and construction teams also.

good,I would come in and ensure that the customers knew where they were going and what they were looking for. I learned a lot about patience because some of the customers could be hateful for no reason. The management felt a little insincere at times but I believe most of them were genuinely looking out for the employees. My favorite part of working at Home Depot was all the friends I made. There are such a wide variety of people working there it feels like a Breakfast Club situation. I still talk to a lot of people that I worked with during my time at Home Depot. My least favorite part was having to stand in the same place for eight hour shifts.
good,"un tipico dia en el trabajo, que en lo personal hay un gran equipo de trabajo en la empresa, simplente aprendi cosas nuevas y hacer mas organizado, mis compañeros un gran equipo y siempre nos apoyabamos, en lo personal me gusto el trabajo, algo nuevo para mi, aprendi mucho en esa empresa."
good,"Great place to start, but had to quit because moved to Arizona. Went to school and work schedule was fine. Co workers were cool. Wish I would of been full time."
good,Day goes by well. Training is up to par as far as the learning about store in general before one even starts involvement.  People are polite which is a trickle down from management.
good,Easy fun job with great hours and pays decent. Monday thru Friday job weekends off. Offers overtime every now and then. working most holidays but requesting time off isn't a hassle
good,Great place to get experience with home ownership related problems. Customers and employees are very informative. Some stores are hot during the summer months.
good,"A typical day at work is a very busy one but enjoyable. Over my 26 years I have learned so many things and now I am able to pass my knowledge to everyone. I work well with all managers and I am looked upon as a manager but without the title. I make my work environment fun for myself, associates, drivers and vendors. Honestly I can say my positions haven't been hard. Going to work and being with my associates, customers, vendors and drivers is what I enjoy most."
good,"Honestly, THD was and is a great company to work with. Only thing is, Theres ALOT of work to be done in every department, so work life and play life, none. Also, if you dont manage to win over the Assistant Managers, who are looked at as immortals, then youre screwed. Lucky for me, i did."
good,it's really hard to get the time off to send with family. But overall the work place was great everyone was nice and the customers(most of the time) were friendly.
good,It was a very fun experience to work for Home Depot.  the staff and management were great.  they knew everything and were trained at their job.  i enjoyed working for them.

good,"I have worked with several employees through out my time at Home Depot.  I am a hard worker who likes to get the job done.  If there is a project, I am the go to girl to get it done and done to the best of my ability.  I help to train new employees, greet and assist customers with all questions and concerns.  Place orders for customers, load their vehicles with their purchases and provide excellent customer service."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Home Depot, I just needed a full time position which they do not have very many of. Your schedule is not they will have you closing one night and opening the next morning which was very annoying."
good,"A nice place to work but my advancement and ways of moving were very rooted and stalled due to other agendas, that of personal and cutthroat ideals that were very frowned upon."
good,I was only able to work for less than a year but I did enjoy every minute of it. It felt like everyone was one big family.  I did enjoy working out in the garden since it was beautiful out but the winters were rough since the little heater barley kept it warm. But I have made several friends working there.
good,Starting work and helping customers as needed. Getting things done according to what is assigned and more if called for. I learned a lot according to what department I worked in. Management is pretty fair and they also help with the customers when needed. The hardest part is when you try answering questions for customers and sometimes you can't. The most enjoyable is helping people and making friends.
good,"Supervisor at the time made sure that everyone who worked under her was taken care of. Any sudden changes, she would make sure that the transition went as smoothly as possible. For the most part, co workers were friendly and willing to work as a team"
good,"Good Company to work for as associates, managers, and customers are nice. It can be a lot of heavy lifting depending on the job. Many associates like the flexibility they have with schedule."
good,"I worked within the store for a only a short time and left only due to lack of available hours.  However, during my time of employment, I enjoyed the team I worked with and liked the mindset of the management team and my fellow co-workers.  They are very safety oriented and the job wasn't the most physically demanding that I've had, despite the number of heavy objects/products."
good,"The home depot fosters a sense of community and cares a great deal for its associates. Hours, full time status, and compensation leave a great deal to be desired, but benefits are excellent!"

good,"The Home depot I worked at was nice.  The camaraderie with the associates and the customers didn't make it feel like a big box store, more like a mom and pop store close knit."
good,I really enjoyed working at a place where I could learn new things and work around the public and help people with home projects and repairs and see the latest items in the market
good,"HD has so many things going on that are geared towards helping customers, the community and most of all their employees. Great team building programs."
good,The Home Depot is a great workplace.  There are the regular routines and then different things to do everyday as well.  Coworkers and management are also great people.
good,Great place to work part time. Very laxed not very demanding like Walmart. I would recommend anyone looking to work few hours to come here.They are very understanding.
good,"I would also enjoy working in Home Depot , the managers are super friendly and they make sure you are happy with your job. Every six months they give you a raise. If your store exceeds the amount of money you need for the end of summer , they give a bonus after your paycheck. Home Depot is a great place to work for."
good,"Good place to work, learn alot of new things, work with many machines to help you with certain tasks in the store. nice people to work. Learn alot from different depts."
good,Home Depot overall is one of the better jobs I've had and has room for enough gor your life to coincide with your work. Most managers are willing to sit and talk with you if you have any concerns about your work. The atmosphere in the store can be describe and cheery but a little frightening at times.
good,Great opportunity to interact with customers and develop customer service skills while helping to find solutions to customer issues. The most enjoyable and rewarding part of the job was in being able to set and achieve personal goals as well as well as company goals.
good,Its a good place to work. Your fellow employees are great and there is plenty of room to advance for those who really try. I really enjoyed my time there.
good,"Work is fun but you work at a fast pace.  You have to make sure your court is accurate.  No room for error, no room for tardiness or absentees. Work is stressful and there really is no work/life balance."
good,The Home Depot is a great place to work.  They have contests at least once a month and the people there are very friendly to work with.  The hardest part about being a cashier for the home depot is that you cant do much of anything else if youre the only one there.  You have to call someone else to help the customer even if you want to help.
good,"work is what you make it. many opportunities to advance. depends on the people you work with. plenty of motivation, seems like a male culture workplace, may not be right fit for many females."
good,Many different areas to work in  gives a great flexibility on learning new things and gives a good opportunity for advancement if so desired. Great people to work with that make it feel more like a family.
good,"Enjoy the consistancy of fast pace/multitasking  company for me, I've always had a passion for merchandising, And here at the Home Depot, there's always areas that allows put to put my passion to work!"
good,"I worked here for 8 years starting the MET team as one of its founding members as a test pilot. I loved the work, the people, environment. but as we grew bigger, like most things.  politics and the dollar became more of an issue than treating people right."

good,"Great company to work for, learned a lot of valuable skills there. Always putting customers first. The management was always fair and up front with responsibilities and tasks."
good,I was helping the customers to create an order. I created quote for order to be picked up later. I do the greeter and also participate in the customer satisfaction.
good,There is always someone there to help you with your customers and questions whether it be management or associates. However you may have to wait a year or more to get to work full time.
good,Overall it is a good place to work. The management listens to associates' concerns and respond in some manner. Good benefits and profit sharing. They always keep the store neat and organized.
good,In my 3 years working for the Home Depot. I have had the privilege to enhanced my customer service skills and my love for working with people and helping when they are in need.
good,home depots i like the job its hard work place to work .the people don't  come to work on time that make work place hard to work at . the moeny is not that good

good,good place to look forward to everyday and the people their were great to work with and the learning experience was an asset to my overall experiences
good,Great company to work for. Only reason I left was because I needed better balance of family/work life.  Scheduling for department supervisors and upper management is a nightmare if your spouse doesn't have consistent scheduling as well. You are required to work overnights which didn't work well with me as my spouse also has job where nights were part of his schedule.
good,Always engaging and helping customers with their products.  Always striving to come up with new ideas for co workers to help reach company goals.  Striving to be the best in my district at our stores.  The culture is always energetic with a happy environment with co workers trying to be helpful to customers.  Sometimes try to over task and not delegating work to other employees.  The most enjoyable is having the relationship I have with my co-workers and customers.
good,"All about the customer. From management down to the employees you can expect each customer to be greeted and cared for equally. While some days can be more stressful then others mainly due to the high volume of customers and being understaffed at times, it does make the work day go buy much faster. But can get overwhelming at times."
good,"Good work environment and great opportunities to learn different work task such as receiving, shipping, replenishment, cycle counts. it has good parking lot"

good,"Great place to work. People were great and always alot of fun to be around. Very good training to get you prepared for the job, and other associates are always willing to help you if needed."
good,with every job there are pros and cons. I still feel this is a good start but its not a cake walk to promotions of new positions so you do have to work really hard and stay positive no matter the issues.
good,Everyday I learn different ways of how to deal with high volume of demanding customers with different needs. I go above and beyond to assist customers that I have a lot or little knowledge of to make them happy and satisfy their needs.

I felt like I had a sense of purpose and it was nice to hear customers tell me how great I was at my job.

good,"The Home Depot was a pleasant place to work. Since my father had used to work there prior, I was treated excellently by many of its associates. I had worked very hard in my time there and was acknowledged well for it. The work environment is dynamic, sometimes fast-paced, usually friendly and welcoming, and allows you to expand your skill-set so as to enable you to apply and work in other fields (which I deeply appreciated). Working as a Lot Associate was difficult but I was often complimented and admired by other associates and felt very happy to contribute. The management is very considerate and kind. I truly admired their style and attention to workers. There was only ever one problem with one particular associate that everyone seemed to dislike due to their behaviour but I was able to overcome any personal differences so as to create a work-environment that directs more towards productivity. A typical day at work involved receiving several calls on the work-phone they distribute to employees to help or assist in loading something, as well as managing the organization of all carts in the lot.  You would have to clear the snow from all the main entrances and salt the walkways in the Winter. The summer and spring seasons would be extremely busy and your services would be called upon throughout the entirety of the day. A typical shift would be approximately 4 to 8 hours (considering the day or whether or not you were part-time or full-time) and would allow you two breaks of 15-minutes and one 30-minute lunch. This was sufficient to allow rest and recovery so as to continue working,"
good,"The Home Depot was a wonderful place to work, the experience was one I will never forget. My co-workers were so helpful, and pleasant, ready to share a laugh. The managers were very understanding if there were ever issues they would hear you out and try and work out the problem."

All the homeowner knowledge is provided to leave you feeling confident with the information you provide to the customer. Great atmosphere and community fast pace and chaotic. The hardest part is trying to get everything done you had planned for the day. Most enjoyment comes from knowing the hard work you put in and seeing it pay off from the reaction of the customer.
good,"Management is knowledgeable and respectful of the individual, which you can rarely find in a retail establishment. One of the few customer-based employers that allows the freedom of tattoos and piercings with no judgement or attitude. The job itself is easy, and the customers are generally happy and fun- we are helping them build their companies or their dreams, or sometimes both."
good,The typical day would be assisting customers with their home improvement needs. Home Depot strives to be the number 1 in customer care in retail. I have learned to use product knowledge in order to provide options for additional needs for the customer.
good,"A typical work day involved point of sale operation, light cleaning and general customer service. Pay was fair. Management was readily available if necessary. Co-workers were friendly and knowledgeable on products found in store and store website and policies. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers to help them find all of the products they needed to start or complete a home improvement project."
good,"In my option this is a great all around job. From the people that you work with on a daily basis's, to getting the job done and reaching Goal every night."
good,A typical day involved watching servers and making sure all guest were happy. The customer was always right so I had to be a solution solver. I learned how to budget a businesses finances and manager people one on one. The hardest part of this job was to be a manager not everyones friend. The best part of this job was knowing at the end of the day I did my best.
good,"I truly enjoyed the experience,I liked the teamenship and compassion from other coworkers and the computer updates for training. I had hopd that management would have helped me relocate out of state but grateful for the opportunity that I had there."

good,"Worked for The Home Depot for a little over 3 years, Most helpful place I've ever worked, great management staff. The only drawback is there is no working your schedule around theirs as most companies do. Full time employees must be available all day both weekend days and can only have 1 schedule exception(eg. i need Tuesdays after 3pm off) If you can work with them on the schedule they will build you up in a positive way."
good,"This was a easy going company to work for. Great management, leads, and staff, not to mention the customers where always friendly."
good,"They hire anyone, which says it all, but its an amazing place to at and the environment is usually cheerful and upbringing."

The management were great, they all did their part to keep the business flowing! I got along with my co-workers really well and also trained a couple of them in the department. The hardest and exciting part of the job was not knowing how your day was going turn out and what items will I have to locate in the overheads. The most enjoyable part of the day was making sure whomever come in contact with me get all the items needed for their project! My agenda was ""If the computer said we have It in the store and it's not on the shelf; believe me I will find it and If were out of stock I will call and have the associate to hold it for you!  If there was a question I wasn't sure of I will direct you to someone who I know was sure""."
good,Home Depot is a great place to work if you enjoy helping people and working as a team. In my 15 years I have learned that the store environment and moral (therefore employee satisfaction) is very dependent on the management at each location. The hardest part of the job is keeping your cool when a customer is being unreasonable or belligerent .

Learn and discuss new ways to improve sales and prevent mark downs in the departments during weekly meetings with management. Also finding effective ways to keep cost of supplies low while demand is high. The most enjoyable part of the job is resolving customer issues while making wise decisions so both parties can end up profiting."
good,I like working for The Home Depot but it's not my dream career. I don't expect to be working there 5 years from now. I would consider moving into corporate if a position came available. There is so much turnover there it is really hard to feel comfortable in the position.

good,"Good place to work because the people were knowledgeable"
good,Good place to work if you have a partner who makes good money. Salary is average but raises are horrible. I do the same thing every single day which is boring. My boss is compared to a drill sergeant and the stores boss is a push-over. MET team works there butts off and store associates stand around and talk and flirt with each other.
good,Good environment and friendly associates. Needs more room for pay improvements and annual raises. Enjoyable part is working closely with customers. Overall and good place to work.

good,"My current position, is Hardware Assciate, I am also cashier certified, and I also work in the Paint department. In hardware, I cut and make copies of keys, cut chain, burn rope, sale tools. In Paint, I mix paint, lift 1 gallon, and 5 gallon buckets. When the check out lines are long, or there is a shortage in staff for cashier's, I jump on a register to help. Management, is always helpful, and available to help us out when we need them. As far as my co-workers, I get along with everyone I work with, and enjoy working together. The hardest part, can be, losing track of time, it stays pretty busy, which I enjoy, but when it comes time to ending my shift, it can be hard to clockout on time, if I'm in the middle of helping a customer. The most enjoyable part of my job, is definitely, learning new things, new skills, new product, and even new associate's."

Ive learned so much from being with the depot from building projects to self confidence and character. Managers are great they teach how to be responsible and accountable for your actions. They play a huge roll just as my co workers does on a day to day basis. The hardest part of my job would be to work and complete task when we are shorthanded. my job mostly requires a two man job on majority of the products we have in the lumber department, and when i am by myself it is simply just hard to get things done physically. The most enjoyable part of my job are the people and customers that come in and let me help make their day."

Home Depot's Management team transfer their values to their associates to ensure a terrific costumer services, so costumers will always put Home Depot as their preference in retail stores. I have learned how to put costumers first providing a good costumer service, leadership and team work.The hardest part of the job is when costumers are not in good mood and reflect that with the associates. Also, when there is not enough associates in the floor to take care of different aisles full of costumers. However, most of the time is an enjoyable moment at The Home Depot talking to costumers makes you learn. When a costumer return thanking you for your previous assistance in his/her project leaves you with a good feeling."
good,I enjoyed my tenure with The Home Depot.  I made lasting memories and gained some good friends.  I learned how to be a leader of a team of 20 to 30 employees.  I didn't enjoy the lack of advancement opportunities.
good,this type of warehouse was a new experience for homedepot. they had a new concept on how to ship with more efficiency to their stores.
good,"I had a good time there. I enjoyed the people I met and keep contact with some of them. Hardest part is the customers. while there is training it isn't career training. meaning that you have basic information that most people don't have (ie difference in annual and pernnials), but you are also not overly educated in great landscaping techniques. some are not willing to listen to your suggests and others want it all to be done by you. co worker are the best, though."
good,I enjoyed this company but there was a manager that came on who made me feel like I was being harassed or bullied by them so I didn't like working with this particular person.

good,"the store is good. lots of good people, some of the management is poor. but overall they look after you. great at working with any problems that do come up, and will try to work around your schedule depending on the store. busy during the summer, gets hot in the store though. main problem with management is at my store is... well they are kinda childish, throwing blame on a dept/shift that has nothing to do with the problem. Murfreesboro."
good,"As a cashier, it's exactly as it sounds. You clock in, and then stand at a register your whole shift. You do get timely breaks every 2 hours though, which is nice."
good,"I love working at the Home Depot. The managers are fair and easy-going, and the work is not very stressful. Most of the fellow employees are in good spirits and always have smiles on their faces. The biggest issue here is pay. The job pays very poorly and when the store is not that busy, your hours can get cut."
good,solo falta un poco mas de promociones para crecer dentro de ella y elevar un poco mas el salario

They offer great benefits, and is a great place to work. You have to be the type of person that wants to put in some elbow grease if you want to move up in the company."
good,Enjoyed the work in areas of my specialty.  The pay was not up to my expectations for the distance I had to drive.  Would not transfer me to a closer store.  Management was fair.  The commute was killing me.
good,"Learn a lot of everyday necessities. Gain experience handling customer problems. My job responsibilities include building relationships with customers and contractors to ensure a great customer experience and both win-win situation for the company and the customer. I have been in many difficult situations where I have to figure out solutions to different problems independently, not stopping until some resolution has been made."
good,"les journées de travail sont chargées, pleines de nouvelles choses à apprendre. J'ai développé des aptitudes d'adaptation et d'apprentissages rapide pour intégrer l'équipe.

good,"millwork clean organized well educated "
good,"A typical day when working at The Home Depot is very fast paced and must have detail and knowledge of products when fulfilling orders for customer's. The hardest part about my job is heavy lifting of lumber, concrete, and getting use to operating equipment such as forklifts and the reach operator .

good,"I have worked at Home Depot for 12 years and have a number "

I learned a lot from the older customers that would come back frequently about life and what i should look forward in my future endeavours. I also learned a lot about plants in the summer and about a lot of items in the store. Management is alright. The coworkers are fun to be around and are always happy to work. The hardest part is when it's super hot or super cold outside because you have to be outside and you don't feel like working in those conditions for a long time. The most enjoyable part about this job is the co workers,customers and the friendly events they have for the workers every so often."
good,This was a good place to get your foot in the call center jobs but they are closed. They laid everyone off and gave everyone a month of pay for the short notice.

good,"Constantly reminding us that they want to be #1 in customer serves in the world, and pushing us to do better. As a Lot Associate, I had fun being able to go where I wanted/ was needed. It was nice being able to go outside and helping people load stuff and asking about their projects. At the time, the pay was pretty lousy but I heard the minimum there was bumped up a bit. The hardest part would probably be when it was cold and rainy or snowing, pushing cold wet carts was not fun. But other than that good job for some young person."

Management varied diversely in culture, skill, and function preference. Co-workers are, perhaps, the highlight of this job. As a team, it does not take long to build friendships and feel as a welcomed member of the company. The hardest aspect of this job is adapting to the overnight schedule required of freight associates, but the most enjoyable is the autonomy afforded to employees once properly trained."

But when it comes to loading trailers, by hand was the absolute worst especially taking care of 3 trailers at once sometimes with various flow, looking at other trailers there would be some lines that wouldnt have anything coming down others would get hit non stop making it very unreasonable and unfair for some workers to have it easier while others did have it harder"

good,the people are nice there. they give enough breaks and lunches just the managers are pretty bad at there job and they got there favorites and will pick them over someone who worked there fairly amount of years. After all its a good place to work.

good,"Like any other company Home Depot has evolution in it's growth. Depending on when and where you work for them you would have had different experiences, I'm sure. At the height of there greatness there was an opportunity for associates to impact the direction of there store by sharing there ideas on how to effect the merchandising and displays. Today the direction comes down from corporate and is executed to a plan. It takes the guess work out of what needs to be done but in my opinion has removed the personality and personal community touch from the stores. Never the less it attracts great team members and was a fun place to work."
good,"This job has a lot of potential to be fun, but the retail environment definitely isn't for everyone. Retail can get tiring in a hurry. Hiring in as a sales position probably wouldn't be too bad, but trying to move up hiring in as a cashier is more difficult. They want you to be the best of the best, which can be difficult since you can't make someone take a survey or sign up for credit."

Home Depot has a great atmosphere with friendly workers. I learned so much, and had hands on experience in the retail field. I achieved great customer service skills. I put my communication skills to the test and improved it. At some point when I was cashiering, there seems to be a lack of management and scheduling. It was rushed work, but if management was a bit more organized, it would be less chaotic. There were also some occurrences with customers not being happy or came off as rude, but I learned to find was to solve their problems easily without getting any emotions in the way.

good,"Retail is not the greatest job in the world ever. Methods of measuring success are short sighted at best. But as retail goes this is probably one of the best places to work. Almost nobody starts at minimum wage. Your supervisors approach problems in a more appropriate manner than other places and then don't take it out on their associates. People are friendly and understanding. It still happens that we are all too shorthanded on a regular basis but, that's retail. It is still a careful process of trying to get people to show up to work and keep profits high so everyone involved can get paid."

good,"The day to day life style in the receiving of the Home Depot is like being a gate keeper. Where every department is trying to take over your land by dropping their product off and leaving it as quick fix. My job as the receiving associate is to empower my associates as well as my self to creatively think of possible ways they could utilize those items in their department instead of dumping it into receiving as a quick fix and to never come back for the item again. While unloading trucks, sending out donations/transfers, processing RTV's, and processing credits from visiting vendors to the store. The hardest part of the job is to keep the managers motivated to work and approve the RTV's so that they don't build up so we don't loose money. Receiving is the area that holds a lot of the money and in order to keep track of every penny, the product has to be worked on a daily basis.

At 6AM the doors open and it is time to get to work. With a forklift operator handy I am constantly running in and out of the store helping customers and contractors get and load their merchandise as well as answering any questions that are being thrown my way. Although this is not the toughest job in the world you do however need to be able to have a nac for multitasking and problem solving. You must be fast yet safe at all hours of the day because there is only a small window of leisure and that is only on your lunch break which comes a lot faster than you'd believe, and who would want an incident happening right before their lunch break? So you must work as a team or independently but you MUST work efficiently in this work environment."

Create customer trust by taking order correctly the first time, interact with the customer to understand their design philosophy and what they are trying to achieve with their project. Management is really easy going. Their goal is to make customers happy, so remember CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT!. The manager on duty will tell you what to do during their shift, if they have any projects make sure you do it ASAP, that will make them like you. Be creative and step outside the box by partnering up with the sign maker so he/she can help you enhance the displays in your department. Co-workers are supper nice, they all have a story to tell and skills to show. I truly enjoyed interacting with all my co-workwerks.

Management was great. I had the privileged of working under a supervisor who recognizes hard work and ensure reward of it.

good,As a head cashier a typical day at work involved me opening or closing all 11 registers and making sure they all balanced out and had enough change for the shift or next work day. Once the cashiers arrived I was in charge of assigning them to their work area and monitoring when they would go to break and lunch so that no schedules interfered with one another. I had to make sure the front end of the store was always running smoothly. My management team did a great job of always helping out when it was needed and always being available to all employees when we had any inquiries about the job. I had the privilege to work with very enthusiastic people that really enjoyed what they did. almost half of all the employees had been with the company for ten years or more.My job had no real hard part however the most stressful part of my job was when we were going to have a corporate visit.

good,I love my co-worker best part of the job to me. no two days are the same so hard to say you can learn about home improvement on the daily hardest part of the job is the rude customers  management has improve its up and down some times. the company tries to take care the worker as much as it can
good,"Fun, I was always on the go. "
good,"Typical day includes working with the diverse population of customers and associates. The environment is laid back, but associates are constantly looking for new innovative projects. Turn over rate seems to be high, but if you work hard and enjoy your job you will last a long time. The hardest part about the job is different shifts in your work schedule. However, Home Depot is a great college job and the company works around schedules."
good,"Its a great place to work. Great people. One of the better retail companies to work for. The expectations are high but not unreasonable. Management could be better, not a lot of communication occurs. The hardest part of the job is not knowing whether or not I am doing what is expected of me. I never get complaints but I dont get compliments either"
good,I find at home depot they are very willing to assist with work life balance.  Being a part time employee I get a fair amount of hours and the company's management team works well together.
good,"It is a fun environment to work due to having new customers. The hardest part of the job is the urgency of getting things done. The most enjoyable part is to be able to help people and have a safe and clean environment for them to shop."
good,"The Home Depot is a good company to work for except for the erratic work schedule.  Hardest part of the job is maintaining tools (cleaning, inspecting, minor maintenance, etc.).  Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers and assist them with the completion of their projects by making sure they have the right tool for the job and providing technical assistance."
good,"Great communication skills, friendly positive attitude, work well under pressure, team player and motivator ability to multi - task, self motivated."
good,Home depot is a place where you can get your feet wet in whatever field you may want o pursue in the future. what i mean is that with how much they promote you can actually make it to upper management within a couple of years.Most of the time you will start as a part time floor associate and from there you must prove yourself in order to get promoted. due to these promotions (part skill and part being in the right place at the right time) I discovered my knack for selling.
good,"Atender al cliente, cobrar la mercancia que llevan "
good,"Fun place, strict attendance. Managers are nice, people are cool, basic call center. Have good benefits, HR is really nice. You can tell that you're replaceable though. Good place to work."
good,this was such a great place to work even if it was just for the season
good,"El llegar a esta empresa fue un reto ya que es una cultura de trabajo un tanto diferente a la maquila, primero fue acostumbrarme a ser multifuncional ya que en la empresa anterior eran puestos especializados, pero poco a poco fue adquiriendo la cultura de la empresa la cual se distingue por preocuparse primero por las necesidades del personal tratando de apoyarlos en la medida de lo posible en las diferentes situaciones que se les presentan."

good,"Every day we are replenishing stock, building displays, resetting product placement, and ensuring the store looks completely neat."
good,"All in all, the Home Depot is one of the most rewarding jobs I have had. Most of the managers actually care about what you have to say, and even ask for feedback on things happening around the store. A typical day for me will most likely be different for you because I have to control nearly 1/3 of the store by myself. This includes restocking the shelves, working the freight, and sweeping every aisle to ensure the store looks grand opening ready for the next business day."
good,"in all it is a great place to work, friendly co workers, good starting pay, and good benefits"
good,"wonderful work environment and friendly associates, lots to learn (tools, product use/installation, making paint, calculating flooring, carpet and tile installation etc.) best part of the job was definitely meeting all the different types of customers and people coming to the store."
good,I was able to learn different skills working at this company.
good,Customers always come first. Work delegation. Team player.
good,"A typical day at work is to constantly monitor any online or special orders. Walk around the store and talk to customers and see if I can help them with something. Having 1 or several customers asking me if we have a product, where can I find this product, answer any questions or concerns they may have. Management will tell you if you need to change directions or help them with something. The store is diverse as far as culturally, and from a customer service prospective I think it is awesome. I have met some great people and learned several things that will help me going forward. The hardest part about my job is expecting others to work like me and HD has FT, and PT Employees, some are trying to build a career and many have retired from careers already and they are here to stay busy. Everybody works but I have always thrived in a team environment and I always want to be the best team and that's a little harder when you can't get everyone to kick it up a notch so we can be the best, or beat this goal. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help so many customers, face to face on a daily basis. I have been in customer service in so many arenas, and this is fun  because I have the ability to change that customers opinion of Home Depot going forward."

good,"For a cashier at The Home Depot, a typical day consists of staying at your register, awaiting customers and their merchandise for you to ring up and assist with the transaction(s) of their purchase(s). Occasionally, they would help the main floor associates with putting up their products on the shelf, or train to be certified in knowledge of certain areas like lumber, plumbing and paint. It was a common occurrence to see a supervisor, the assistant manager or the store manager walk the floor and greet the customers, and make sure all departments are running smoothly. The co-workers would help in other departments, and, occasionally, if they had no work on their plate at that time, they would take a short 15-minute break. The hardest thing about the job was standing on concrete floor all day in practically one spot for several hours. Meeting new customers and returning customers and just making small talk with them while ringing up their merchandise was probably the most enjoyable aspect of the job."
good,"Sales associate, electrical department. Very valuable experience. Many skilled and professional people in home field gave me an lifetime of experience."
good,"Having to do five or six jobs cause we dont have enough workers for shift."
good,"I work in a fast paced environment, I lead by example. Customer service is a key factor in my position.  I work well alone or as a team."
good,I've been working at The Home Depot on and off since 2004. I really enjoy the fast past and enjoy helping customers find what they need. Home Depot is a great company to work for because there is room for growth. At times it can get hard when a customer is unhappy with the customer service but I always find a way to change the mood.
good,"no fue ameno pero supe sobrellevar la situacion , era pesimo laborar ahi."
good,"Home Depot IS the number 1 Home Improvement Retailer in the world for 2 good reason, the Product they sell and the excellent Associates they have to help the customers' needs.  I've enjoyed working for The Home Depot but I need a job now that will better fit my life style and family time."
good,"Go to work on Monday's and Tuesday's to write the schedule for the employees to be published by Tuesday at noon.  The rest of the week is to help employees with understanding benefits, helping with their development, organizing and maintaining various work areas, and setting up interviews and hiring in in employees."
good,I worked at Home Depot for 3 years. i was still in High School for my first year and they worked very well with scheduling. It was very hard to move up in the company unless you knew someone. Other than that working there was great.
good,Unload trucks as well as other items then load truck back with items.I looking for an entry level job the management at this location was good
good,"I just got a millwork position. I did not know anything about that department. I had no one to train me or show me the information for months, but then we got a new ASM and he realize one day I did not know anything. He was nice about it. So he mad sure I got the training right away. So I was able to be more helpful. It was hard but I enjoyed that I got to know my information and not telling customers sorry that I could not help them out. Besides that it's a good friendly company."
good,"My typical day at work is a steady paste speed at Home Depot. I learned how to always interact with different customers with different attitudes. I learned how to respond with patience, and how to relax especially when it came to hostile customers. The hardest part of the job was when i came across a few customers who didn't know the English language very well. They did not come with a translator or we had no one at work at the time who spoke their language. Another challenge was when a customer needed help with a specific item especially when i had no knowledge of that certain item. The most enjoyable part of the job was being outside in the garden center. I enjoyed being around nature while doing my work."
good,Everyone was so friendly and welcomed me with open arms. they are also knowledgeable and experienced in their departments
good,"Great flexibility in work schedule for students, co-workers work as a team, the  most enjoyable paer of the job for me was assisting customers & helping them find the best bargain."
good,"Good compensation: however no balance of work life, hours were too unpredictable"
good,"Over all The Home Depot provided for me a great deal in the years I was with them.  If you work hard and show initiative, the sky is the limit at what you can do within the company.  They promote from within so the extra work usually pays off if/when you get promoted.  Working with the people was probably the best part of the job, especially the crews I worked alongside with."
good,"a good place to work"
good,Home depot is good place to work. They have a great work environment. This was one of my favorite jobs I've had.
good,"Everyday was different but it resulted in a good outcome. I got along with every associate and manager because we trusted each other's skills and personality. The hardest part of the job would be multi-tasking because there are some tasks that you have to do while you're already working on another one. The most enjoyable part of the job would be interacting with the customers while you're assisting them with their product carry-outs because you can build a good reputation from not only the customers, but the associates and managers as well. What i've learned was that you should take your time with all of your tasks because trying to rush through them will be a lot more difficult to complete."
good,"great team work and great management experience,in a fast and working retail store"
good,Love the people worked with and the benefits too ..it's just management were never communication between them.. to much favoritism

I was often one of a few associates who knew how to special order everything.  The hours are based on a computer program that determines how much was sold on a certain day going back five years. This computer model seems logical but didn't work for retail.  Managment kept sending people home because we were over hours even when customers needed help. I usually got to stay because of my special skills but I was selling outside of my department so often my hours were actually cut because my own department didn't sell enough to support me. Catch 22? paradox? Because I could sell anywhere in the sture I got to stay but because I didn't sell in my area my overall hours were cut, somtimes 0-6 hours a week. "

good,A typical day at work at The Home Depot varies.  The workday can start as early as 5 or 6:00am until 2:00pm or you might work an evening shift 3:00pm until 11:00pm. I have previous experience in both retail sales and construction work so the new experience was provided by the customers.  Dealing with some customers requires that you be alert and careful.  Such as the customer who came into our store and asked for assistance in installing a gas log into and artificial fire place. Explaining to this customer that this was dangerous and should not be done was a difficult task.  The customer was very determined. But I explained both the fire risk and the carbon monoxide poisoning risk to the man until he understood that he needed a real fire place with a proper vent before he could install a gas log or build a fire. I would say that explains the hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable.  It is sometimes hard to get customers to do the job the proper way but it always feels good to know you may have saved a life.

They offered good benefits, good wages, a fair work load, they had good management, and they exceeded in putting a sense of value into all of their employees by using awards and other incentives for a ""job well done."" The only reason I left this company was because as a full-time associate you cannot request any specific schedule, you have to be fully flexible which required me to work a lot of weekends and evenings. Although I do not have an issue with being flexible, the amount of times I was scheduled on the weekends or during an evening shift cut into my much valued family time with my young children.

good,"Retail is never easy.  Often not enough support from management.  It becomes tedious when customers are always assumed to be right in all situations, when often not the case."
good,Consistently learning new fact about home improvement and products to help Contractor and do-it-yourselfers complete projects. Management was always a call away incase of issues that arose or if manager approval was required. At times thing got difficult when there were many customers who needed assistance and we did not have enough associates to assist them in a quick manner.  All and All the good definitely out weighs the bad.

My hardest part of the job is not having a set schedule it changes week to week. My most enjoyable part is the people I work with.
good,Positive work environment. Every day consists of helping customers in their do it yourself project needs. Provide them with the tools and product knowledge so that they will be successful with their projects. The management is pretty good and willing to help their associates succeed. The best part about the job was when customers returned to tell you and show you pictures about their project. It felt good that they shared with you their good experiences and they thank you for providing the guidance they needed to be successful.
good,"Special orders, fun working environment, customer service, invoices I have a strong idea of all the products that Home Depot sells."
good,"The Home Depot has always been an exciting place to work. No situation is ever the same, therefore, every day you learn something new. Management is excellent. They are understanding and will always be there for any type of help you need. Being able to help the customer and find what they need is always a plus to your day."
good,"Working here was a great learning experience, as I was able to gain a lot of practical knowledge.  The people I work closely with have become my good friends.  Though, outside of them, there are many people who do not pull their weight and are content with getting paid to do the minimum.  Despite the fact that this creates more work for my team, I still thoroughly enjoy helping people and doing our small (or large) part to keep the store running smoothly."
good,"I started at The Home Depot as a cashier, and within a year, I had been promoted another two times as a flooring sales associate to a department supervisor of paint. There are lots of benefits included in working here. Work environment is friendly and secure. Typical day at work includes 100% customer service with light tasking.

good,"One of my happier jobs, I started out as a part time associate in the Electrical department and was trained to cover vertially every department in the store in a short time.  After 6 months I was promoted to a Hardware Department Manager in a new store opening up in Nashua NH.  The hardest part to the job was the hours as they shifted over time and based on what was going on such as inventory, stocking etc.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers and customers as serving their needs was fun and challenging."
good,"The Home depot is a fun and very cultured place to be. Teaching you how to communicate with customers.Managers are usually there to help out. The best part are the co-workers, always there to help when you are stuck. There really is no difficulty in the job. The best part is working outside on the lot."

good,"The hardest part is working freight with limited time and help."
good,"For almost a year working for the home depot, it was mostly interesting. I learned to cooperate more with customers weather they're happy or unsatisfied. Most of the time I switch the page and satisfy them by showing them that I really do care about what they need and are looking for. At home depot my job is to put my customers first and that is my main goal every day that I put my time there. My responsibilities are fairly well. There's a lot of detail in it but it has to be done. My drawer is one of the main responsibilities. I have to make sure that my drawer has the right limit of money otherwise I must make some changes to take out or add in. The hardest part of the job is trying to make a rude customer satisfy. I understand that they have difficult jobs and are sent to get what they need and don't have a clue where it's located at the store and need great assistance as soon as they walk in he store. Well I do my best to find what they need as a cashier and let them"
good,I enjoyed working for my previous employer home depot. I was sad to leave such wonderful hard working and friendly co-workers. This was an experience of which will host a life time of memories. home depot was a great place to work. Due to my fathers passing and inheritance I have found myself looking for a new home of employment with the same great atmosphere. I hope to make a new long and healthy career in my new community.
good,"A typical day is helping people solve their problems or locate an item in the store and down stocking. I have learned about pluming and how to operate new equipment. The management is great, very approachable. The group of people I work with are great always willing to lend a hand if needed. The hardest and most enjoyable part about the job can be the customers. Sometimes it can be difficult to get the correct information needed from a customer, but when you do and answer their questions it is rewarding."

good,Was an ok place to work for. There was a little too much drama between the managers and workers but overall it was good. I learned how to sell product and inform people on ways to apply the product. I learned communication skills to help assess the customers need and be able to help that customer find what they were looking for. Hardest part was avoiding the drama. Enjoyable part was helping customers and workers with anything in the store.
good,"Employee morale is very low due to the inability to advance.  Many of the staff members are placed in departments where they are uncomfortable and lack knowledge, while being taken out of departments where they excel.  This is under the premise of making the next department better.  Instead, staff becomes unhappy and both departments suffer."
good,A great place to work and grow personally as well as career-wise.

good,"i learn how to communicate well with the customers. i have better my attitude to give the customers what they want and need. my co workers there are like my brothers and sisters. the hardest job there is the rejection from an employer to customer when we are out of stock, which we should never be. the most enjoyable part is when a customer walks out the door with a smile on their face."
good,"I have been working for Home Depot for the second time since February. They re-hired me as I had been working for them previously in 2007. I am currently very happy working there, however, they have no full time openings and I need more hours. I was hired as a seasonal part-time employee and they have now made me permanent part-time.

Once the projects have been distributed, those who have been given project(s) will break off and go tackle those projects while those who weren't assigned projects will usually work on the default ""cleaning bays""."

I also learned quite a lot on customer service and helping customers to the highest of my ability. The co-workers I worked with were extremely helpful and willing to teach and train me in anything I had uncertainty in. The hardest part of the job was probably the physicality that came with a lot of the heavy lifting that I had to preform. That also was a benefit because I didn't have to go to the gym! The most enjoyable part of the job had to be helping customers that came in with a problem and being able to solve all their worries.

The Home Depot provides all the necessary tools and information you need to complete your work. Your day flies by as you follow a structured schedule of service, projects, and customer interaction. There is very little opportunity to for work-place drama because there is always something to do and working independently is a must. The management just like any other company's management team. The opportunity for growth is scarce on the MET Team but The Home Depot allows you to make lateral moves into the stores in case a position you qualify pops up. The best thing about the MET Team is the schedule! Monday through Friday in the mornings--you can't beat that!"

good,"I love working at home depot, very fast pace and wonderful management and co workers"
good,This a great place to work and you can always advance in the company.
good,I enjoyed my time at the Home Depot and learned a lot while I was there. I started as a cashier while i was in school and when I finished school I was quickly promoted and rose through the ranks until I became a manager. I was lot go because of cutbacks due to the recession but I do not regret anything about working there. I learned to manage my staff and my time and get reports done. I also learned how to deal with different types of customers and keep everyone happy.
good,"Start work at 9 p.m look over fork-lift, stat to bring in stock items to be stocked using the reach truck"
good,"As a head cashier, I've had to do plenty of multi-tasking. I have to ensure breaks and lunches are followed through, ensuring that lines at registers stay short, ensure training is up to date with cashiers and lot associates, be able to handle a change drawer, and be able to function in other departments. Co-workers are generally easy to get along with. There is much to learn, not only administratively or operationally, but with product knowledge. Management can seem very slow to respond to customer-related issues or in-store issues in general."
good,"A typical day at work starts off with a walk through the department in order to check for any safety issues, general mess and out-of-place merchandise. My particular store was very busy, so I spent most of my time at the desk mixing paint for the customers. On down time (i.e. not mixing paint at the desk) I would walk the aisles and assertively assist any customers with any questions or concerns they had while also keeping an eye on store appearance. In the event that I would have no one to help, I usually begin down stocking merchandise and and any other bay maintenance. The typical work day in paint, at least, has an endless cycle of these major activities. Every now and then, more times than none, I assist customers outside of my department. The hardest part of the job while also being the most boring part is trying to find things to do when you've completed all of your tasks already. That said, the most enjoyable part is when it's busy and you are able to confront many people with their orders or questions, which helps the time go by quicker. The co-workers and management for the most part are easy going and will work with you, but of course, you'll have one or two that you don't see eye to eye on. Considering that is unavoidable, the people as a whole were nice to be around. The premium that Home Depot puts on customer service, whether your recent experience was good or not, is top notch and should be considered when former Home Depot employees look for a job elsewhere."
good,not a bad place to work. has its ups and downs as with every job. i learn a lot all the time. everyday i learn something new. talking with contractors is very helpful.
good,if you dont mind working retail then home depot is a good place to work for

good,"My experienceat home depot was a overall good experience even though the store I was at was like high school because no one knew how to mind their own business and have positive things to talk about and keep the negitivity to themselves but every store is different not all stores are drama just my store, besides all that I enjoyed my job there I learned something new everyday and the customers made my day I would recommend this company to anyone and I would most definitely go back."
good,A typical day at Home Depot is up-beat and very hands-on. I've learned the importance of multi-tasking and how to better manage time along with some skills and tools of building things. Management is also very helpful because they are also in the feild with you and what your not sure of they are right there to assist you. Co-workers come and go depending on what they are able to handle. For the ones that stay around they are also upbeat and helpful. The hardest part of the job I would have to say is learnig and becoming fluent in every department and staying on your feet for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part is always the people.
good,My typical day was helping customers. I learned how to work with lumber and building materials. Management was pretty good to work with most of the time. My co-workers were wonderful. The hardest part of the job was having to stoop and bend to lift very heavy items. The most enjoyable was the recognition that was given.
good,"There is alot that I learned by working at Home Depot. The managers are friendly are everybody gets along with eachother.

For the first 2 hours I would help unload the freight trailer and pull old freight pallets and bring them to the floor in an organized fashion. Then I would begin to work my assigned departments; Food, Sporting Goods and Automotive. I would do resets depending on what new promotions/specials were coming out."

It was frustrating because we were always short cashiers so I wasn't able to cross train into a department, but for the most part my managers and co-workers were really cool people. Except the guys in lumber and building materials... Freakin' DISSAPEAR if they so much as SMELLED a customer comming. Lazy creeps. This was several years ago. It has gotten better at the store I was at since then."
good,friendly and work well in a team enviroment.

Management differs with any new job, but as a whole the staff individuals are understanding and give the job their necessary attention.

I learned that every product is important, so every deadline has a priority point and figuring that out is what daily all day meetings are about.

The most enjoyable part was visiting the stores to reset the bays or take pictures or meet with the vendor to get their input."

good,"Kind people, friendly atmosphere, great benefits, automatic scheduling system, lots of people."
good,"I actually really enjoyed working for Home Depot, but if you're looking for growth, and you weren't popular in high school, you will have a hard time getting ahead. If you don't get all wrapped up in the politics, you will like it there. I worked on the freight team, and I loved it. To me, it was like being paid to work out, and you missed out on all the drama during the day. I started out near 9.00 an hour, also had a 401(k) (HD stock is good stock, so its best to invest) health benefits not so much if your part time. My only pet peeve is the management is very immature, and you sometimes felt like you were dealing with high school seniors. The freight supervisor was cool, I liked him, and a few others, but the bigger managers, would gossip, and say inappropriate things, and basically looked at you like a peon, unless you were just extremely charismatic, then you were more likely to gain favors, full time, ect. Also, during the day, DRAMA DRAMA DRAMA."
good,"nice people, employees are really warm and at home, learn alot of product knowledge."

good,It's a good company with a strong future  in job security. This company provides assistance to employees thru the Homer Fund. You can relocate to work at different stores or facilities like a  call center.
good,Enjoy the job and the people. Management takes good care of the people. Culture is second to none. Only complaint is where it is located. I would certainly recommend this company to anyone who is considering working there
good,"Home Depot offers many programs for employee development and company growth."
good,In my 30 years of working retail. The Home Depot has to be the 2nd best company I ever worked for. The people are great. As a Supervisor you are given the chance to run your business and manage the people and have fun doing it.

good,"I worked at The Home Depot for 8 months and it was a great job while in university. They are overall kind, flexible, and understanding. "

good,Good place to work. Their are room for growth if you want it. There are a lot of thing you can learn from the company. The benefits are great. The schedules are flexible also.
good,I worked nightshift so it was a really fun job. you got to work at your own place unbothered as long as you were getting things done. The company would throw little parties after big sales. Friendly work enviroment.
good,"Home depot is great with everything except pay accommodations. They did not like to approve OT which would be fine if they paid enough to live off of. Management was fantastic up until we got a new guy in who had never previously managed an overnight crew. After that, it still wasn't terrible, just annoying. Overall the company is a genuinely good, caring company though and will work with you on most anything within reason especially if they know you to be a hard worker."
good,Great place to belong to a big team. Literally no shortage of coworkers and everything feels easier being part of a team. Also a great place to meet plenty of new people. They work with you to build a schedule you can work with.
good,"Un buen lugar de trabajo, muy organizado, un trato muy humano y permite el desarrollo al persona. Empresa comprometida con sus clientes y la comunidad"
good,"Customers will be rude, try to scam the company, and bring dirty items to return. You will have to tolerate these customers if you want to work as a special service associate. Thankfully managers usually have your back if theres a bad customer"
good,"Management was always avail and great. Hours and days were not flexible and they work with you for last minute emergencies. it was a comfortable environment, pay was decent, and the responsibilities matches up to the job description."
good,"As a part time flooring specialist at THD I love my job. I find that the experience really depends on your counterparts and management because the job is team-oriented. Assistant managers (ASMs) come and go, especially the really good ones which is a shame. When you have good ASMs it is a very fulfilling job, the feeling of being acknowledged by your superior is great and coworkers feel like family"
good,A typical work day was traveling to the store we were working at that night.  We were given our project/s for the night and set out on our own to complete them.  I learned how to set bays based on a planogram and how to set the sample for the bay.  I learned how to use tools and tear bays apart to reset them.  Our Manager would have a meeting every night to let us know what projects were to be done ans assign them to each of us.  If we needed his help or had questions we had to find him and have him help us with specific instructions. The hardest part of the job was heavy lifting and not having all of the materials available for your project for the night. The most enjoyable part of the job was completing all of your tasks and knowing that you did the job correctly.
good,"- Very positive work environment "
good,It’s a good place to work for someone looking for a job. There are positions for all types of people there. I’ve seen people that are 17 and people that are 71 working at the same workplace. It’s amazing.
good,customer service is number one the managers are very open to whatever issues you have and everything was so easy pace training is easy and i was very clear and optimized
good,Overall a great place to work but it did have its moments. The work as a cashier is simple but incredibly boring. If you're unhappy with the work it's really easy to move to another department and go from nothing to so so much. My only complaints are how slow they are to back you up when a customer starts being rude and how snobby and cliquey the management comes across. It's a good first job and career option with good benefits. Good luck on your search!
good,"It has been a while since I worked for Home Depot, but I can safely say it was a job I rather enjoyed for the time being. Very helpful staff to assist you with your every needs and getting fit in."
good,"Lovely environment and people and very particular about their policies an procedures, but that makes for such. great company and positive work environment"
good,"The Home Depot has been an experience I'm glad I had I gained a lot of knowledge and skills working at this company. Made a lot of friends and I really enjoy doing my work. The most enjoyable part if the job was the customers and the projects they would be working on. I was able to make a lot of their dreams come true, and that gives me joy. If hired by another company I will be sad to leave The Home Depot, but I need to work closer to my home."
good,Most appointments come from stores. Online sales has decimated in store traffic. Appoint volume has been a disgrace for 24 months now. Mid level management pushing local manager to ADD sales people. One appointment a day it's impossible to make a living on pure commission.
good,"Working at home depot has to do with a lot of physical moving. you will have to be walking around standing lifting heavy stufd but i don’t mind it, because i get more active in moving."
good,"I worked hard for the short amount of years also have worked many departments at homedepot parking lot Associate, garden, delivers, flooring and lumber also worked a little freight but was never in that department just helped as much as I can do I have some experience also I have achieved all my Machine license such as forklift, reach truck, electric pallet jack I Got to go there delivery truck to take customers deliveries and I was a trainer for all the machine so I can train people to drive them"
good,There is room for advancement if you are willing to work for it.  Great place for self starter.  Best part of job is the lasting friendships made.  Most management started from bottom and worked up.
good,"Management is great, caring and if you are determined to learn and advance in position they will chaperone you up the mountain. Lots to take in however but once you get the basics you get the specifics as well."
good,"mininmum wage for part-time sales associated, i enjoyed the working environments and insurance coverage. fliexable time schedule is good for full-time students"
good,"I really enjoyed working with the receiving team as we would not only work with our counterparts in the store, but be the team to resolve any issues with regards to any incoming product.  We were the ones who assisted in keeping the relationships with the delivery team in good spirits with the HD team."
good,"lugar con excelente capacitacion, sueldos competitivos"
good,"Management expects a lot more out of you than what they they pay you."
good,Great good of people that I work with. MET is an awesome group.  But hard to get to a full time position. Great hours and easy to get time off. Great supervisor.

good,I have had an overall great experience during my time with The Home Depot.  Upper management does a good job taking care of its people. There is always challenging work on a daily basis.
good,"Lively coworkers. Flexible hours. Management is great when you actually try your best and work hard. Willing to work with you and advance your career, If you choose."
good,great work environment. coworkers are all kind. management is very understanding and willing to work with associates on scheduling and time off. hardest part of the job would have to be the miscommunication between management and employees as to what needs to be done by who and when it's needed to be done. the most enjoyable would have to be the coworkers and how kind hearted they are. another negative is that there are a lot of rude costumers.
good,"Home Depot has been a very reliable place to work, providing a stable and supportive work environment.  Many opportunities if you love retail and working with customers on a large variety of projects."
good,Working here at the Home Depot has taught me a lot of valuable assets that I know would be useful in everyday life  One of the best jobs I’ve had so far in my life
good,"I have worked at 3 different locations and have found some Managers have better Leadership skills than others, which has a lot to do with a Store's Morale."
good,Had a great time working hands on with customers. I learned a lot from my peers and from the great customers we served. Learning new things as always been a plus for me.
good,Overall it's a great company to work for. I enjoyed my coworkers.  We really work as a team. It's just I had to drive 1 hour and 30 minutes there and back. Three hour drive got to be a bit much.
good,"I worked night shift so didn't have to deal with costumers, but my coworkers and supervisors were all very nice and cared about our well being."
good,It’s a good place to work at and to start a career. Things are fast paced and everyone is friendly and helpful. Things that you can’t control will happen but overall it’s a good job

good,I enjoyed my job as a paint associate. The people were nice and there was always something to do. My employees were nice to work with and there was always opportunities to work different jobs.
good,I learned at home depot very quickly and everyone was extremely helping and patient. The only complaint is that I handled a lot of money and it was really dirty. other than that the job was quite enjoyable and a very welcoming environment.
good,"They are very flexible and accommodating to kids in school. Especially working around days you need off, and the amount of hours that you are able to work each week."
good,"Coworkers were nice, made working easy and days passed quickly. Work was never too hard and kept a steady pace. There was a single manager that seemed to get on associates nerves but other than that the managers were good and did a good job leading the store"
good,"I like the people I worked with and my managers were amazing! Everybody worked great together. I love being around all my coworkers, the customers were really nice!"
good,"I feel they have their favorites which are easily promoted. The company is very generous when needed time off and flexible schedules, very good training"
good,"Great environment, management does their best to ensure company values and standards be honored. Great opportunity to create the best version of yourself."
good,The Home Depot is probably the best company I have ever worked for in terms of how they treat their employees. They have a lot of different working opportunities within the company and offer great trainings for on the job success.

good,"i got this job while in college and its great place to work while in school, because the hours are flexible. the store has many departments and with time you learn a lot"
good,"Arrive early enough to be wearing proper PPE, CSA approved steel toe boots green triangle, Apron that is provided, with gloves, safety knife. myLink earpiece to connect groups, individuals and the full store as well as smartphones which access inventory, storage, orders, customer calls receiving, and more. Once you are on the sales floor you report to your department and assist with anything you can do, team lifts, equipment operating. mandatory breaks that are spaced out depending on shift length. No day is the same but the support per shift is outstanding."
good,"Manager is easy going and good to work for. Will let you know if a job is well done. Pay is low but who doesn't think they are underpaid. No employee discount which will keep friends from bothering you for your discount. They do offer other discount programs like movie passes, car rentals, pet insurance, etc etc"
good,"I had an interesting, albeit short, time as a Merchandising Execution Team associate. I was assigned projects that were fairly easy at first, and was given more and more challenging projects as I got more comfortable with them. Everyone who worked with me was a blast to be around; all very friendly and excellent to work with. When it was time to part ways due to the graveyard hours I was working, my supervisor was more than understanding, and made sure I left on a good note (as did everyone else)."
good,The job is very nice.. good management i happen to work at the service desk so it is a bit stressful but overall you feel very welcomed and very nice people to work with
good,"Loved working there, I would have kept working there if I did not move. Lumber was a hard work, but I learned a lot and most customers were contractors so I would ask them a lot of questions."
good,"It was always busy day shoppers come and go. "
good,"A typical day at work was somewhat stressful. I felt welcomed by the employees. The manager was super sweet, and encouraging. She helped me gain more confidence, and motivated me. I learned how beneficial speaking 2 languages was, especially in such a diverse environment. I was also taught more about building technology. The hardest part of the job was most likely learning the basics of using the machinery and working with larger pieces of wood and other materials. The easiest and most enjoyable part, for me, was taking care pf customers and working with other employees."
good,"It’s a great opportunity, great savings. You get the best of both worlds. It’s working in a warehouse, and also working in retail. You get to learn a lot, about Home Depot. And the type of benefits we offer. Not only as an associate, but as a customer as well."
good,This was a pretty good job for some extra cash while I was in college but not as a career. The task we had to complete were fairly easy and management were always helpful.
good,"Always were fair and honest with me."
good,"Very good work environment, management was very friendly, it was like family. Food was brought almost every week, it was an easy gig. The job also came with many health benefits and securities."
good,"You're expected quite a bit and taught things your first day in. Highly recommend you REALLY pay attention during your orientation!!!!! It goes over a lot and at a decent rate, always ask your questions otherwise you're going to be confused. Hardest part of the job is almost always the people or your manager for the department. Each store is different, but my biggest personal struggle was a Head Cashier that was always on everyone's case about everything. She expected nothing, but perfection and it drive me insane."
good,"Life at the Home Depot is consistently busy but not overwhelming. The employees are always smiling and enjoy working there. The work atmosphere is positive. The managers are always helpful and they do whatever they can to make employees happy as well as the customers. The employees do everything they can to protect and provide a positive shopping experience to the customers. Overall, working for the Home Depot is very positive and excellent."
good,"The employees here are very welcoming and helpful when it comes to learning the store. If you have two part time jobs with varying hours, they don't really work with you on the weekends."
good,"The company is good for the beginners, retired and student. The only concerns is they give too low pay rate and annual pay rate, but all in all it’s fun to work with my co-workers, schedules wise is good and besides I’m a second party vendors under Home Depot. And I’m proud to be a Home Depot employee, I just need a new opportunity to meet my goals and dreams."

good,They need to add leads and supervisor positions to the SDC.  No stepping stone.  Great company with benefits and stock options no discounts at the stores but discounts for hotels and car rentals things like that.
good,Home Depot is an excellent place to work with amazing people to develop and learn new skills. it is a non union job requires lifting up to 70lbs. seasonal job
good,You are either busy restocking shelves or helping a customer. Either way you are always busy. Great benefits. Hours vary. No discount whatsoever. Other than that great place to work.
good,Good place to work they really make you feel like your family and they work around your schedule so your able to go to school   Advance in your education
good,"For the most part the company cares about the workers really just depends on your managers. Perfect job for highschool kids and college kids if you're not in need for money. Home Depot has a hub where you can literally pick you availability to a tee once you're hired. Easy job ideal departments are flooring, appliances, cashier."
good,"I was offered full time position within 15 minutes of interview. I accepted the customer service associate position  and learned about every aspect of the stores services  through that experience. I have been able to maintain the hours I wanted, and even though some moments are not that enjoyable when dealing with unhappy customers, I learned many deescalating tools."
good,"Home Depot was a great place to work i enjoyed each of the days i came in to work,i learn to work with people and communicat,i had good manager, as long as you new your job work was not hard,i just loved my job and I enjoyed doing it,i worked at the lanham store 6mo.I have worked in shops most of my work history,so i look forward hearing from you soon."
good,You have to be very productive. It is very fast pace and you have to be on your toes. For the most part its a great job always be aware about the state laws its always helpful with any experience that you go through this job.
good,Home depot has great work ethics and are able to move up the company. Associates are always willing to help others. Management always took care of its employees.
good,They train you on hand to learn better. Theres alot of training in the computer so you can get an idea of what your job is about. The hardest part of the job is trying to fix orders that have been in the system for a long time.
good,"Great place to work and every day was a good day unless a manager thought work could be done in different way, usually causing work to get backed up for the next couple of days."
good,"Overall, it was a pretty good job, especially for my location. I was there 6+ years. I worked in pretty much every department. Good benefits, 401 K, stocks, bonuses, and decent pay (depending on what you consider decent). For me it was more of the people that I've worked with versus the actually job lol. I would definitely recommend working there."
good,"Working under Talent Acquisition, overall I've had a good experience."
good,"Working at Home Depot has its pros and cons, however the pros outweigh the cons by far. If you are looking for a job during school, work here. Simple. The pay is great, the associates are usually always nice and welcoming. The work is not hard, if you aren't afraid to meet new people, then come and work at the Home Depot and become part of the family."
good,My typical day is dealing with customers whether they are rude or generous from the time they come in until they check out. I typically just share the knowledge and they are on their way. Show respect and it is given even when they are rude to you.
good,This was a great part time job the people are good the benefits are better I mean they give stock options they match your 401k that’s free money I tell everyone it’s a good job
good,I enjoyed interacting with customers and sharing my knowledge with them to help them decide which tools to rent or the best course of action depending on circumstances.
good,"I loved working at Home Depot, despite not loving the shift I was assigned. My coworkers were great to work with, if sometimes difficult people. I loved working with the supervisors and store management. There were plenty of things not to like, as with any job, but if personal circumstances had been different I would go back quite happily."
good,"considero que es una buena empresa, la cual ofrece buen sueldo a sus empleados"
good,Good future building job I’ve worked there part time for 18yrs Besides 4yrs in the middle I went full time it’s a great company they take good care of their people
good,Very high energy job where great work gets recognized! Very easy for advancement. Great management team that help you learn. Works as a team and helps associates when needed
good,"Overall, my job as freight team associate was pretty straightforward. Put the product on the shelf and do it fairly quickly. Typical day at work was just walking around the store seeing what needs to be put up and away. Management was pretty good although some nights were rougher depending on who was managing that night. Workplace culture was pretty laid back. Everyone agreed on just do your job and do it right and there won't be problems. Hardest part of the job is working through the night and going to bed at 6-8AM. It's hard physically and mentally but the pay does somewhat make up for it. Overall, it's a solid 7/10 job. It's not glamorous but if you're young and looking for some decent pay, I can recommend this job for you."
good,Excellent Company.  They are very big on taking care of the associates and addressing their concerns.  Only negative for me is there are not many Senior Manager opportunities within the Maintenance Directorate.
good,The Home Depot is a really family type business. They feed you about 4 to 5 times a month. They give out tickets to different types of sport games zoo water parks etc
good,"I worked as a Lot Associate and it was honestly tough on me, physically. However, the workers there definitely made my day better and were extremely friendly towards me. Managers were overall decent and weren't necessarily too hard on anyone, but the sunburns and the amount of work I did was not easy, in any standard."
good,"I work on the merchandise execution team,  and it's sometimes stressful because of time deadlines on projects, but other than that our team is efficient and excellent at their job. Store side lacks communication because the manager doesn't listen to workers. Service desk is stressful because people think they can check out there, when it's only for returns, exchanges, and order pick up. No time to train properly, because the manager understaffed that day or people are no call no show. MET team does more customer service than associates because of understaffing and a few people being lazy."
good,I began as a freight employee working early mornings and late nights to ensure the stores was properly stocked for the morning and afternoon rush. I was quickly promoted to lumber associate which came with a slight pay raise and increased responsibilities. I enjoyed the lumber department and the new challenges that came with such a busy department.
good,The work place was great. All my co-workers were friendly. I liked all the work i was given even if at times it was a difficult task. Its a great first job or long term job.
good,Ive learned a lot  at home depot how to do back splash and learn all the cleaning supplies also made me get out of my comfort zone. Many people taught me a lot very friendly associates
good,"customer service is key"
good,"Good place to work it is what you make it. Can be extremely fast past environment at times. Overall not a bad place to work for, great for just starting out or career job."
good,"I had a good time there aside from some management issues, overall its a fine work environment. Though only full time grants health insurance and I was injured on the job and had to just work through it."
good,"Home Depot has a great support of Associate committees providing perks of cookouts and assistance when needed. It is a good company to move up the ranks as it prefers hiring  from within.  I personally, did not like the numerous weekend requirements."
good,"Home Depot provides a professional atmosphere that is friendly, management is reasonable and accomodating.  Home Depot is dedicated to taking care of its employees just as much as their customers, and is a excellent job to get accustomed to a faster pace work environment while being supported by co-workers."
good,I really enjoyed working at Home Depot. I unloaded multiple trucks each day and had to be thorough when checking them in and separating the merchandise. The vendors and truck drivers that I saw each week became a sort of family. I still see some of them in public and enjoy catching up. My reason for leaving was I needed help with something that required at least 2 people and was falling over and could not get it. This had happened on multiple times and I did not want to get injured. I believe under different management I woukd not have had that issue.
good,"I love my job, but my body has taken abuse. It’s time to move forward, I still have to work a lot of more years. I can’t keep abusing my body. I have said Everything I’ve feel about the job I’ve dim necessary."
good,"I started Home Depot when I was sixteen and in high school. Three years later, I am still working there while in college and have gained extensive knowledge, switched departments, and earned a promotion and raises. They work with my classes and allow me time off during school breaks and allow me to transfer between stores during summer and winter break."
good,Great work enviroment. usually pretty fast paced with oppertunities to move up within the company. Great benefits. customer service is there main goal and will pay bonuses for meeting sales goals twice a year.
good,"Labore por temporada y aprendí bastantes cosas, el ambiente me pareció agradable y mis compañeros siempre me apoyaron en todo. En temporadas de ofertas o cuando es expo x departamento, es algo pesado ya que la fluencia de clientes es muy elevada y a veces no te das a basto con los empleados del área. Siempre se respeta tu hora de salida y la de comida."
good,"Its a good family environment to work at and great group of employees that love and enjoy their everyday job.Plus the drive is terrific, least to me it was only 12min away"
good,"The job itself was wonderful. The managers were kind and understanding, the coworkers were friendly, the hours were flexible, it was all pretty good. My only complaint was the customers and the corporate meddling. For some reason this store is riddled with entitled old people that think they know everything. You have to have a LOT of patience to work here. Also corporate keeps making random rules and increasing the amount of questions you have to ask. It got to the point where I was worried I would get in trouble if I didn't harass customers to apply for a credit card. It was absurd, and you could tell it annoyed the customers."
good,"its better than most retail. The workplace culture is very tight knit. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with customers but, it does help you learn how to deal with different types of people."
good,Best place to work because of my co workers and also is a family oriented the hours are good they give u any chance you need and help you with any programs they have and if you a situation that you  need help they will help you at any cause.
good,"This store is filled with the nicest, most thoughtful people anyone could meet.  They really are family and treat you as such.  "
good,It's a good job with fair benefits. Flexible hours for those in school. Management is fair to all employees. Room for advancement in all positions. Would recommend to others.
good,"Usual cashier day would be going to a register for a bit and rotating out with other associates for breaks and lunches.  Having a high active noontime than low afternoon and mornings."
good,Everyone is very nice and a good place to work. The work there is not that hard to do. The manage is nice and caring with everyone. Long hours for anyone.
good,"Low pay but low stress too."
good,Home Depot is a good place to work. The employees that work there were friendly.  It is a fun place to work. There is room to advance. It is a friendly safe plave to work.
good,Fun job however management did not match personal skills with job.For example professional painters would be placed in garden instead of the paint department and professional plumbers would be placed in tile. Never could figure that out.
good,"Company does try to take care of its associates from having cookouts, to time off, to benefits. It is a good place to be if you want to keep a job very long,  because they work with you on schedules to help keep a good worker on staff."
good,We had work intensives that made the job a little more fun everyday. They would cook us meals on occasions to boost moral and every 6 months we would get a share of the profits for the store.
good,"Overall a great place to work for. They offer a slew of benefits and the people are awesome. If they were willing to pay premiums to keep their employees then I would have stayed. Another driving factor is the respect their designers get in our community. Unfortunately it is not a lot but they are also one of the places to get cheap or free design services, unlike custom building firms."
good,"Great work atmosphere ,but low pay and no negotiation  with pay raises but if you want climb the ladder willing to help people advance in store and good benefits"
good,Cashier: fast passed  on busy days just making sure items scanned correctly making sure measurements are done correctly. You get 15 min breaks overall a good job for a high school kid.
good,"Everything is good, although your manager can be good/bad you just have to roll the dice. Staff is amazing , you can make many freinds and they will always help you when needed , you never feel alone even if you work independently sometimes."
good,A good position to work if you don't want to deal with the pressure of working directly with customers. If you're detail oriented and like working with minimal management but also like the occasional different task asked of you this is a good job. You also get the chance to learn how to operate heavy machinery and get a real feeling of being integral to the store's operation.
good,"easy job, but it keeps you busy. days consists of helping customers where nights primarily for freight/stock replenishment. definite people person type job."
good,"Good culture, team and management. "
good,If you have ever thought about working at Home Depot this is a great place to work if you need a good part time job.You will learn alot about how to fix homes as you continue to work here which is great if you are having any trouble with issues at home dealing with plumbing electrical.
good,I learned a lot working at Home Depot. Having to supervise crews of up to 35 people was simple because they all worked well together. The hardest part of the job was not having enough room to store extra product in the overheads.
good,"Home Depot gives employees great opportunities to advance and work on their skills.  They have coaches to help along the way when you start to show you around and teach the culture of the company.  The only system I do not agree with is the VOC Survey given on the store and cashiers.  The surveys are given more weight than they should be in my opinion.  You can give great customer service to customers but if someone else gives them unsatisfactory service, it is taken out on the store, especially the cashier.  I constantly have to fight to keep my metrics up but if I get one bad survey, managers expect you to get more and more.  Same with credit cards, service leads, and sales."
good,"I enjoyed my time with at the home depot, although I did not want to leave a better opportunity presented itself in my life and I could not turn it down. If the pay ever goes up at the home depot I would return to my store in a heartbeat."
good,Has it up's and downs working at the store. Most people you work with are friendly. Customers sometimes cause problems. Management is good and wary because they transfer managers every couple of years.
good,"Come to work and started cleaning up the lumber area, reset all the lumber location with the appropriate types and amounts of lumber. Assisted the customers who came in looking for products, as to the locations in the store and assisted in cutting lumber they purchased if needed."
good,Typically a work day as a a garden associate consisted of coming in and seeing what there is to do that day because its every changing. Its not to hard of a job.
good,"Physically demanding job, but co-workers make it so enjoyable. Enjoy helping customers, majority are very nice. Never had any confrontation with anyone."
good,Great company to work with depending on your career level and need for advancement. You must network within the company to grow and the opportunity to do so is wide open.  You have to understand the business well and build a footprint for yourself and not wait for someone else to do it for you. Its a very large company with lots of opportunity.
good,"Management and employees find ways to make the job enjoyable by doing events. They have what is called a ""Fun Committee"" to help coordinate such events."
good,I work in tool rental as full time technician. All co-workers are very helpful and respectful. Very relaxed environment. Possible advancement available.
good,Just come to work on time an get credit than you will be the best employee of all time. also push leads like for all the things they offer to the customer
good,"Honestly, I adore this company because there are many that want you to succeed and grow. The work place isn't bad as long as drama is to a minimum in your store. Management could definitely be better though."
good,"As an exterior sales consultant I was my own boss. I managed my appointments and calendar daily to ensure I was on time. I had the ability to work from my home, vehicle, or store. My position was 100% commission.  I really enjoyed doing what I did: however, the company decided to eliminate products and services, this caused a Nationwide layoff."
good,"It honestly wasn't a bad job. Management could've been better, but it wasn't bad. Somewhat laid back, but still had to meet some sales goal. There was a chance to advance up, but not that big."
good,All the other employees were nice and very welcoming. I made friends quickly. Even the higher ups were really nice to me right from the beginning. Makes for a nice environment.
good,I learned great management skills there. I had the opportunity to be a head cashier and it was fun. I had to closed the store every night and I had good communication with the ASM.
good,"great place to work, you can advance as much as you want and meet some very nice people.  If you choose to you can make friends both from the associates and customers that can be a part of your life."
good,"typical day consists of customer service, interacting with co-workers to establish a safe environment. Management is about team work and takes into consideration the work ethics of others."
good,Home Depot is a great place to work if you want to have a strong community of fellow associates. Home Depot takes care of its workers in terms of benefits.
good,It's a fun place to work I was work there for 20 years started out as a cashier and garden worked outside on the lot and then move to deliveries when deliveries for the past 15 years my shift was 4 a.m. to 1 p.m. attempted a lot of walking lot of orders come in and a lot of page and over intercom and managers were pretty good about having my back the most durable part of the job was having my team ready to take on any issues  a good  place  too wook
good,I really enjoyed working outdoors and developing working relationships with many different contractors and even first time D.I.Y. Fellow employees were pleasant and hardworking. Overall a great culture to work for.
good,you get to work. unload and sort the trucks. go out onto the floor and restock the store. i learned that its OK to not completely finish you cart load especially if you have more than 1000 products to go through. management was kind and willing to work with you. very ethnic and respectful. getting through all my carts in the department i was working in. learning the store and looking at an empty cart at the end of my shift
good,Good place to work with ability to move up in the company without relying on seniority. Benefits for full and part time employees. As in store mid-management my biggest complaints are pay grade and the hours are all over the place. Early mornings to late nights.
good,"Excellent staff. Many opportunities to advance, whether it's associate, management, corporate, or other. Would recommend to anyone looking for suitable and flexible work."
good,"The work environment is great. The culture and atmosphere really make you feel as part of a ""family"". Most management (of course there's always exceptions) are more than willing to work with you on anything having to do with your family matters, and are very supportive of your advancement. I would say the only down-side is the pay, but with minimum wage constantly climbing, i can understand the difficulty."
good,Management at this store will definitely work with you and try really hard to accommodate your schedule. Sometimes the basics get lost over the long busy days and monotony day in day out. We strive to provide a great shopping experience for the customers and safe for us all.
good,Great place to work and learn. Many opertunities for advancement. Good place to work if you have the people skills and knowledge. Overall company is good to me.
good,Home Depot has always had a lot of business and will continue too because they have great values and love for customers but sometimes it just feels like us associates are unappreciated.
good,"As a Sales Associate, it was busy with customers needing windows and doors.  It was a lot of knowledge to learn and interesting to learn as well.  Knowing that I was helping people start or to finish a project, felt great."
good,"The company really focuses on teamwork and I loved that, the company really gives you job skills in all areas and gives you experience with customer service by attending to whatever the customer's needs may be. My coworkers and myself were always willing to help each other even if what we were doing had nothing to do with each other's departments."
good,I sold flooring it was fun. But stressful at times... Had to leave once they took away part time insurance..wish there would have been more hrs available
good,"I worked there throughout college and it was great.  Super nice people and if you know what you're doing it isnt hard to start helping people around the store.  Loved the environment but if you have bigger aspirations, you will eventually have to leave.  Still fondly remember the smell of pine in the morning."
good,There are many avenues to learn skills and knowledge. You can go at your own pace.It is very important to keep track of your learning and especially if you are working in the outside lawn and garden dept.
good,"I had fun and The Home Depot taught me a lot about business and management. I owe it to them for building my knowledge but also my work ethic. Professional, fast paced, and competitive work style is the way to describe it."
good,My job at the Home Depot I would not say is bad. I have high job security with decent hours and decent pay. I enjoy the people I work with and most of the regular customers.
good,"Worked here for a summer during university. Management was good, frequent feedback, lots of training and there were many incentives and rewards for being a good worker."
good,Is a good place to work.  Weekends are required for full time employees.  They are usually happy employees and are focused on employee satisfaction and safety orientation.
good,"Give consistent hours, vacation time and give holiday pay hours. Would say it is best when looking for a part-time job. The overnight shift is very consisent in this area which differs from Lowes"
good,Depending on what store or area you work in your experience can either be good or bad honestly. You might have terrible coworkers or you might have some great coworkers but the area is terrible. I had great coworkers but the area was terrible and very understaffed in several departments leaving you alone to do a lot of the work on your own.
good,The place is a great place to work however the hours can be on short supply simply because it is a nice place to work. The only negative about the job itself is the fact it can be dangerous for those who aren't aware of their surroundings with the heavy machinery moving around.
good,"- Learned to create and maintain orders"
good,"You do jobs that are not in the description. You wire lights, move beams, and reaarange bays. I would work 10 hours and not even have enough time to eat."
good,"Thought pay is low, the job is fun and rewarding.  working with customers, helping with product and projects plans and procurement.  the opportunity is very good for the time you stay with Home Depot.  Many Associates eventually hire as supervisors, department leads, or other rewarding positions throughout the corporation."
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for.  There's definitely job security.  However they are hesitate to hire full time staff.  Most employees are part time.  Also the pay is better than most retail stores, however keep in mind just about everything in Home Depot is heavy (tile, appliances, lumber, quikrete, etc).  All employees do a lot of heavy lifting.  Some departments more than others. It can be back breaking work and you're also expected to stand on unforgiving concrete floors all day.  Not to mention the chemicals from all the products that you breathe in.  It's just not a job for everyone."
good,"You have to be very customer oriented and make sure they come first. Staying in the aisles is the key to being a good worker, there’s always something to do or someone to help."
good,Enjoyed working with customers and fellow employees. Enjoyed working outdoors most of the time. I learned a lot about plants and lawn care. I left because the job was just too far away from home.
good,"As a morning shift worker we are assigned  to setup for store readiness we are given a list from the store manager or assistance manager and some task are as easy as sweeping the floor one sweep or just a single object on the floor and some very difficult.What I learned from working here is to give great customer service while under pressure. The reason why Management needs help is because they expect us to get the task done but at the same time tend to the customers needs. Sometimes it is possible to do but other days it is not but managers starts to complain rather than trying to help you. One of the first thing I learned in Business Management in college is the difference between a boss and a leader. A Boss complains and tells you what to do but a Leader finds the problems and works with you to overcome with it. Even till now I only Consider 2 of the assistant manager a leader. The work culture is amazing it is very versatile and honestly I love my co workers. The hardest part is if you work at a department that requires a lot of physical lifting and the 2 machines at work is being used , you'll have to thousand pounds of merchandise to the customer with a pallet jack . The most enjoyable parts of the job is when you help the customer and do your best and they reward you by seeing their faces smile and say these fine words "" Thank you so much for helping me with my needs"" . There are many rewarding thanks you but that is just one example of many. Another enjoyable part is eating enjoying lunch with great co-workers"
good,hoping for the best result at work and gaining good rewards from the team and company  where i learned many things in cloud and production level and good ppl.
good,"Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph."
good,"a typical day at work is answering clients demands; be it complaints. "
good,"A typical day requires me to answer phones, assist customers, call vendors, check order status, check the department under control. The work place culture was Great, management was fair and easy to communicate with."
good,"Home Depot Hwy75 and Hwy380 McKinney TX, store is very enjoyable, entertaining work place. Upon entering store you can feel the positive vibe from associates, even store manager engaging with all; entertaining dancing down race track, promoting positive gestures, and ensuring all are satisfied. Tasks are maintained by all associates in departments/area; daily task are minimal, which allowed focus for customers. Also as a manager allowed time to teach, coach, train, and develop all associate in departments or yourself for promotion. Store is a contractor store (meaning sold mostly bulk quantities) shifts are constant, fast paced, and not redundant gaining product knowledge throughout."
good,"Great working for the home improvement leader  but most opportunities seem to be based out of Atlanta. Very limited ""regular hour"" jobs locally. Must be able to deal with multiple personality types and multi task. Very fast paced."
good,Home Depot is a great place to work. The management is one of the best I have ever met. I worked with a very smart and competent team. I world recommend Home Depot to anyone.
good,Great place to work.  Fun environment with games and other fun activity.  many ways to advance your career and learn new technology . You can work from home and management understand when you need to leave to take care of personnel business.
good,"This is a big company, and there is a lot of room for growth. One thing I loved about Home Depot is the culture. They pound the orange blood into the employees"
good,"Working at Home Depot has given me quite a few opportunities to develop skills and knowledge in various areas that I previously didn't have much insight into. Some of these include lumber and construction, hardware, and gardening. As a whole the atmosphere is good and most of our associates are good. One complaint I do have is the communication between departments and management can be difficult because not every associate communicates and some problems fall to multiple departments instead on a singular one."
good,"Working at The Home Depot is what you make it. The first year you work, you don't get vacation, just sick. Plus vacations expire annually. I worked there a whole year as a part timer, promoted to full time at customer service. Only after I looked into it and proceeded. Home Depot won't promote nor give you a raise after a promotion; again you need to be proactive about it. My first year I accumulated about 20-24 hours of sick time and have only 20 hours of vacation. Full timers get 40 hours. Home Depot offers good benefits, fortunately I'm still on my parents. They also have a Home Depot shop where you can get discounts for working at them Home Depot. They also have success sharing. Depending on how much is left after paying to the stolen product and the ""big wigs"" get their cut, you will get yours as a regular pay roll check so it's taxed. For mine the minimum was $100 and got only $60-$70 back. After knowing what you'r doing and what you'r allowed to do, you can easily help customers with ease and you'll get quick at it. makes the day go by faster with less unhappy customers. Co workers vary, I was lucky to work with some great people, but after moving to the other side of the store, I have some people I would rather not work with now."
good,"Great place to work, amazing atmosphere and the work/life balance was incredible. They constantly worked with you, never against you. Training was always provided and they assured me to always ask questions and reach out when in need. A work place you most definitely can grow in."
good,"Family culture environment, must be a hard worker to be noticed, fun place to work at you will learn a lot about every department. Management is like any other , some are good some are horrible."
good,Excelente sin problemas puedo obtener mi carta de recomendacion de la tienda
good,"It's a great place to work. It pays really well, but some of the people you work with is difficult to get along with. but overall its a great opportunity and a great place to work."
good,Home Depot is a pretty cool place to work. I love the fact that the company shares with there success by giving a percentage of there earnings with their employees.
good,"When I came into work everything was organized and ready to go, they trained well for their smart sort program to make unloading and stocking efficient."
good,"excellent in coverage and training"
good,it was heavy work and the managers were so unfair people would leave home because they were tired of it and leave everyone else there to work even harder. managers would offer voluntary time off to too many associates and make everyone work harder to pay less people to work twice as hard. only good side was they feed us once a month and give a company share bonus.
good,I would arrive check computer for orders. I learned how use excel and a forklift. Management was ok hard to talk to but the team was really good. Hardest part was communication best part was the team.
good,"The people are typically akin to friendly neighbors who are willing to fix that leaky pipe for you. Everyone's cool with each other, and if they're not it usually gets resolved quickly. But the management process seems to push people to act as if Home Depot is their lives. Typically you get less than 1 sick day a month and vacation is only given after working for a year. With the entry pay being, at the point of this review, $11/hour it's kinda surprising for anyone to last more than 6 months. Since they really only hire once per quarter, this causes management to turn to the employees that do stay for the long haul and tell them to pick up the slack. This causes multiple departments to be run by 1 department manager or 4 hour periods of 1 person in a department on a weekend. And while you do learn a lot on the job, it doesn't typically come from the training they give you. It comes from talking to contractors or employees who have worked longer than you. Meaning when new associates come in it is also your duty to train them quickly for no extra pay so they don't ruin someone's house. For reference I have worked in the paint department for 1 year and I am the most knowledgeable associate in the department, including the new department manager. I have taught all 11 associates in my department and I have never painted a thing in my life. Home Depot can not afford experts, they can't even afford retired experts. It's a great place to learn how to be handy, as I said I didn't know anything about paint and now I could do a house from scratch. It makes for a great second job, job"
good,"Home Depot is a great company to be employed by.  Although the customers, managers, and duties can be demanding at times, you have many opportunities for advancement should you choose to take advantage of them.  The benefits are some of the best around and in my experience, they take care of their employees."
good,"This is a great place to work if you love to provide exceptional customer service. The Home Depot is very into their their safety of customers and employees. The benefits are awesome from Dental,Health ins. 401k,Human relations and aware line, There is always someone there to help. They will cross train you in other departments and they like to hire for other job openings from within the store. They want to ensure that customers get everything they need to complete their projects. They are always interested to hear employee feed back and what would be better for the store. They always try to show appreciation to associates when they have done a great job and gone above and beyond especially for a customer. They do not tolerate drug,alcohol,sexual harassment or bullying. This is cause for termination., Overall the Home Depot is a very good place to work with great people"
good,Fast paced environment never short of work always need to put customer s first.  Associate s have the ability to take care of the customer often with needing manager management is available when employees need there support .
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs, because of the people I worked with. I left after 2+ years, because I just needed a change but I know that I could always go back. They pay great too."
good,A typical day at work include checking off safety checklist before driving the forklift. Morning meetings with the entire morning shift. The hardest part of the job was loading semi trucks with freight.
good,"I would recommend home depot as a part time job in college. The work environment is nice and relaxed. Customer service is fun and most of the people you meet have some fun stories,"
good,"No matter what shift I worked in the paint department I was always learning something new or given a new task to do. Prior to transitioning from the front end (cashier) to the paint department I knew nothing about paint. I learned that there are many shades of the basic colors, even white and black. I learned how to mix paints and what color tints will make a certain shade. I learned the differences between indoor/outdoor paints. Varnishes, epoxy paints, etc. I learned how to work more efficiently to create a more relaxed and easy workflow for myself and others. Because I was so fascinated with a lot of things concerning my department I was always more than happy to help or to learn. When you have awesome co-workers and professional representatives available to help teach you or answer questions you should have no room for failure. What I enjoyed most about being a paint associate was being able to help customers hand select their colors, mix their colors, gather necessary tools/equipment needed for their project(s) and hearing their stories of how satisfied they were the next time they come in."
good,I worked part time as an order puller. It was a fairly easy job except in the summer months. They expected me to help every department because I didn't have one.
good,I enjoyed my time working there because it was very easy to pick up the pace and everyone made sure I was comfortable in my area. I was recognized when I exceeded expectations.
good,"Employees were well taken care of and treated fairly.  The company gave everyone the opportunity for advancement and provided excellent benefits, with time off without penalty."
good,"Heavy call volume."
good,Home Depot was a quick paced job but with much teamwork. The employees and management were a great team to have around especially during busy days....
good,"It was a very competitive job,  we competed with other stores in our department. Plus we had to make a deadline in our department to meet our goals. Sometimes we had to stay later. But ultimately wouldn't take back that experience."
good,Fast paced environment ~ Never a dull moment!  I enjoyed getting to know the community and my co-workers.  Lots of room for advancement and a chance to work in different departments and learn new things.
good,"typically customer service and seeing familiar faces that trust me is what gets me through my day , since i really enjoy helping customers and solving their problems ."
good,"A typical day could be really busy and time will go by fast, or really slow and the hours drag on. I enjoyed talking to my coworkers during the slow times. I learned quite a bit on the job, I was constantly looking to learn new things though. I learned not only about specific products and projects, but also how to do things like use the FIRST phone and page overhead and cut keys. I learned how to close and how to cash out the self checkouts, also what to do if someone tries taking something. I learned a lot about customer service that I didn't already know. Management were all very nice, I felt like they were my friends but I was also a bit scared of them at the same time haha. They were all great. Everyone feels kinda like a family there, you all work together, and there are plenty of events they put on so you feel involved in something and make friends. The hardest part of the job, to me, was dealing with some of the customers, and also the whole standing for hours at a time thing. Sometimes the standing was no problem, but other times it was horrible. When I first started there my back was killing me, over time I got used to it though. About the customers however, Home Depot is really big on customer service and the customer is always right thing. So even if a customer was completely wrong and being a huge ""jerk"" you still have to smile and nod and a lot of the time they get away with whatever they are asking. I would often get yelled at when I did nothing wrong by the customers, because they would act like I, personally, am Home Depot and I am obviously not. Sometimes I"
good,"For the time I spent with Home Depot, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed working at my store 1948. I worked with a great group of younger and older associates and several managers all of whom I had a great relationship with. I know not all stores are the same as I am a customer at local stores where I now live. I was disappointed at the lack of customer service in some of the stores - like walking right past me without acknowledgement.  That rarely happened at our store. It doesn't take much effort to smile and say hello."
good,I remember working at a busy large hardware store.  I worked as a cashier.  I feel  my work as a cashier went well because I have data entry experience as well as customer service experience. Perhaps I had a smooth day because I understood my job as cashier.  I sensed that professionalism at HD is rather high-employees that understand their work.
good,"muy buen ambiente laboral, te dan excelentes capacitaciones, tienen muy buen valor hacia el asociado, te apoyan en tus necesidades, cada tres meses hacen convivencia con los acesores hay muy buena oportunidad de crecimiento."
good,A typical day is very busy at home depot putting in orders finding order working on the computers as well as the cash register dealing with customer answering phone doing contractor orders. I learned even more customer service I learned how to work on a cash register I learn the true meaning of multitasking. Management could have been better and the job would have ran at lot smoother. The workplace culture was great very diverse. The hardest part was we was very under staff so where there some always be three people sometimes it was just one but it also made it a very good learning experience. The most enjoyable part was the costumers.
good,"everyone is treated equally and fairly, adequate training and coursed are provided for associates. there's good support from HR and management team. overall great company"
good,"Home depot is a very good company . "
good,"Overall a great job. They have a success sharing program which gives back to the employee a monetary benefit for all the hard work. Great to learn about home improvement while helping customers as well"
good,I love the benefits that Home Depot has to offer.... Haven't ran across any other job who's benefits can too theirs.... Great atmosphere and co workers.
good,"in this company, l was really happy as i saw that my colleagues always cared about me, and supported me in different situation. in home depot, we care about all the stakeholder."
good,"From the minute you clock in until the minute you clock out, you are rolling at 100 miles per hour. Most of the associates there are friendly and will have your back."
good,Easy to learn fast paced. Some managers are great but not everyone can be perfect. They are fair and informative. I learned about several departments. I enjoy the people I work with. Though its still retail and gossip come with the name.
good,"Very competitive work style and fast pace. Learned a lot working there of how everything works,a good place to build a career but must put a lot in  time and effort to move up."
good,at the time I left they were asking me to move into management training.  sadly at the time I was enjoying kitchen designing so much that I left that opportunity behind
good,"Busy, good active pace, and simple. Good employee interactions. Good reward system for work accomplishment. Diversity among employee personnel. Good accessible for company website."
good,"My time at Home Depot was very informative and fun place to work the staff is helpful ,fun and always willing to help learn more about the store and as well as the company"
good,The Home Depot is probably the best starting point for any one starting out in the workforce. There is nothing that you learn here that will go to waste.
good,"You know your schedule due to weekly schedules are posted well in advance. You arrive, clock in, get to work on your assignment and clock out at the correct time."
good,"In my 10 years with Home Depot, I have had many opportunities to take development within the company into my own hands. I have grown a network of colleagues and associates that I continue to reach out to. I have also had opportunities to lead teams through some of the toughest times. (Disaster Relief)"
good,The pace is fast and you work for numbers. Sometimes that is stressful but if you have a good supervisor your goals can be achieved. Many managers will help you but some are very disrespectful and need more training.
good,"Enjoyable work environment . Lots of opportunities. If you like people and want to work in retail , its the place to go. They are flexible and willing to work with your schedule."
good,Well in the home depot is really a good comany! the wokr is work no havy and not easy but is nice
good,"As a cashier, I spent a lot of time just standing there kinda waiting for someone to ring up. There's lots of small rules that tripped me up but if you get them down and don't mind low hours you should do fine"
good,"I enjoyed working at The Home Depot, because it shows how much potential I have given to experience a working environment, dealing with customer services, and how to have fun on my job."
good,"Customer service was our number one priority at home depot. If the customer wasnt happy then we didnt do our job correctly."
good,"Working at the Home Depot I have realized the job is not very hard if you have the right mindset and everyone there is easy to get along with. Also if you have any problems, management will do their best to address those problems."
good,You walk the floor. You are alone most the day. You review CCTV. Your responsible for multiple stores. You are not micro managed. You are seen as management.  You get an office. You get a uniform you get an iPhone. You get a lot of crews stealing from the store and your required one app per 40 hours
good,Home depot is an awesome company to work for. There are career advancement opportunity for you as an employee. Most customers are friendly and looking for your advice/assistants
good,the job itself was hands on and rewarding. it left opportunities to learn other areas and skills from all departments and the individual home depots them selves would also have community projects that they would organist as well as ask if team members would like to host or help with weekend projects in store
good,Home Depot is very flexible with its ours and the staff is like a second family. However the management can be very toxic. I was lucky because I had the really nice supervisors / managers. Overall the work is easy and the days are fun.
good,I have fun here love working with emplyees love cashier but just need more pay and hours close to home i know my cashier job very well i know my customers very well.

good,"It was ok the time I was there."
good,"I would like to work for the Home Depot again. "
good,"The Home Depot is genuine about what they do and why they are doing it. They are a company who looks to work outward for others in doing all they do, well. With many benefits to their own community they are a company who looks to build up their community and their workforce."
good,"Great culture, poor work/life balance. They feed us all the time! People who work there are great. Company truly puts customers first and takes care of its people."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot, was fast paced and enjoyable.  The contractors, regular customers, or the new DIY were the best to come in contact with.  I love working with people, so it was a joy coming to work."
good,"The Home Depot is a fun place to work. They have fun and safe place to work. "
good,Lots of room for advancement. Plenty of overtime available. Great benefits. Bonuses often. Often free food. Big on safety and respect. Very hit during summer.
good,Busy hard work  !! i learned to work hard and work well with customers !! management  was justice and wise  hardest part of job working by yourself !!
good,Everybody is always willing to help. Everybody always takes care of the customer. General manager knows what he is doing and most of all he knows in what direction the company is going to.
good,I love working at the Home Depot. We work as a team. Very family oriented. There is constant work to be done. I love keeping busy and being able to enjoy the company of my fellow associates.Customers know me by name and often ask for me personally. I am able to solve there questions within minutes or research a solution.

good,Trabajar para esa empresa me Silvio de gran esperiencia muy buena compañía
good,"Cannot comment on a typical day it is on an individual experience and position.  I must say I  have learned  lot about workplace, as far as the culture they are constantly promoting if that is what you want.  They get your feedback on how to better communication and all they can do to better the overall call center and performance."
good,"It was a great environment except for a few individuals but other than that it was a great time. Management was of fair and just treatment, I just had some small issues here and there."
good,Home Depot is not a bad place to work. I really like the people I work with and most customers. I would like to stay but the wages aren't  the best and unfortunately set schedules like I have had for almost 6 years have been taken away and I really need Monday - Friday. I watch my grand kids in the afternoon and on weekends.  I would reccommend it to anyone
good,I have been with Home Depot 13 years and after 10 years with the company and many attempts to advance I was finally given the opportunity to advance into a department head position. Training is minimal for the position I took as a department Head. The position I have now no training at all.  My hours are retail hours but as a Department Head it leaves no room for Family or leisure time. My current position is 3 nights a week closing and with the current labor model it does not a lot for enough associates during the high peak of the business day.
good,Good place to get experience in different field's so you can grow in skill set. The people I worked with were fun to work with and be around. It was nice.
good,It was a good place to work while I was there. Employees are able to advance with in the company to different departments. It could  be hard work depending on which department that you work in.
good,"The Home Depot was really more about helping people more then anything else. So it was nice to help people who needed it. Rather then being about sales and having to just clock it, they developed a culture of helping."
good,Home Depot is a fair place to work. They have a very constructive way things are set up. As long as you provide the service required there is no problem. The pay of Home Depot is not to live off of if you want just one job.
good,"I enjoyed much of my time working for Home Depot. Compared to my job before it, this one was better in so many ways. I was a valued part of the team, the hours and pay were good, and there were many opportunities to advance within the company. I learned so much in this job and a lot of it is still applicable to my life. The management was encouraging, friendly, and gave many chances to improve yourself. We celebrated many things together, there was often free food, and each employee was shown appreciation. When you're in need of a job that requires little or no experience and a work environment that nearly everyone can thrive in, I recommend Home Depot."
good,"Home Depot established a good work environment for employees. Employees are allowed to take charge and trusted to make decisions. Employees are rewarded for their hard work by being recognized or given additional benefits,"
good,"A typical day at work is customer service,go-backs, stocking,and facing. I learned about flooring,kitchen and bath, paint, some plumbing and blinds. Management is always changing but sometimes it is not a good change. The culture is pretty divided, the workers who have been longer care a lot more than the younger new associates. The hardest part of the job is the difficult customers but the most enjoyable is the people you get to meet."
good,"This place is great to work at, it offer a number of new things to experience new things as well as experience new events that teach you as well as you learn from."
good,"can be pretty relaxed working here. hardly ever are you stressed, but work can be fast paced during certain times of the day. Management was fairly good and communicated."
good,Though I worked at The Home Depot for a short amount of time in that time I managed to learn a lot about the different departments inside. The Home Depot was actually my first job and I loved it.
good,Going into to work is enjoyable due to the people I encounter everyday.  I love hearing stories from customers and meeting new customers during my shift.  I enjoy helping people with their projects and love when they come back to show me how they turned out.
good,My overall experience so far with The Home Depot is great. I like the people I work with especially because everyone in my shift is like a family. We help each other a lot when needed and never leave another employee behind.
good,At the time working for The Home Depot the pay was pretty good. however there were people how worked there that were not team players and belittled employees.
good,"Pros: 1. Flexible schedule good for students."
good,Work environment depends on the store and how busy the store is. The flow on new employees is constant and few stay over six months. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers.
good,I believe this is a great company to work for. The benefit package continues to catch associates and future new hire eyes. The management team is very involved with the people customer and employee providing great service
good,I feel that Home Depot is a good place to work if a person is interested in a career in retail.  For me the hours in retail as I get older does not promote a life outside of work though.
good,"Recomendable trabajar ahí, es un lugar seguro y confiable"
good,"Good work Environment, there is opportunity for advancement and compensation is adequate when compared to the job. The company is well managed and results shows that."
good,"They a lot  good things, but after  working 19 year with exel  is a big different, I always  due work  office, but they don't care if you are hurt  , I being  on this building  for 9 year doing a great job  with no complaints, never missing  days  and now they want me to work  on the floor  and don't know why,  I am getting tire of driving is to far for me.They have productive  and  fun work place with ping pon ,basketball game, and other."
good,"The co-workers are great. When you join the team you join a family. The management team is okay but not the best due to evident favoritism. However, there is a great atmosphere if you can overlook that."
good,"My time spent at Home Depot was alright. Nothing terrible, nothing great, just alright. The employees and managers were nice. It was comparable to any other job in retail."
good,"In my experience working at Home Depot, the workplace culture was always lively and vibrant. We were always celebrating something, which distracted me from the monotonous work. The most enjoyable part of the job wasn't the work itself but the friendly faces and the characters that walked through the door; regardless if they were regular customers or first timers, everyone shared a little bit about themselves."
good,"Help customers all day while learning more about each department. Every associate is helpful and has a great attitude, but customers don't understand every associates position such as, new hires. Can be difficult for new hires because experience happens on the sales floor. The harder departments in my opinion are hardware and pluming because you have more customers to assist and there are more go backs. The most enjoyable part of my day is helping customers that are in dire need and are extremely thankful for your help. I enjoy working in the paint department because I am always helping customers in need of help."
good,"The title says it all. I truly liked coming to work just because of the people that worked there. While the managers had there own agenda. They did care about the associate, but once you crossed the line they will show you the door."
good,I started as a sales associate for 3 years. Then for 3 years was the Kitchen and Bath supervisor. Most difficult was solving the delivery and damage issues with the installs of appliances and kitchen cabinets
good,"I really enjoyed working for Honee Depot. The sites in New Orleans were huge advocates for the community and put in a lot of time after Katrina to bring jobs back to their employees. The benefits are good, pay was competitive and the working environment was friendly and comfortable."
good,"The company is very good to its employees and the co-workers tend to be close knit and cooperative. The only down side as a freight associate, in my opinion, was the occasional period of unreasonable expectations. For example, having a team of 5 people expected to handle 3 trucks worth of freight during busy season in a single night."
good,"Working for The Home Depot is one of a kind. They really care about their employees, management has a true open-door policy, and the workplace culture is great! The hardest part of the job is the behind the scenes operations. The most enjoyable part of the job is the great management that you work with. They work everyday to help you obtain your goals within the company, or where ever you want to grow."
good,Insanely fast paced with competitive co workers in sales numbers. Management was moved around a lot with plenty of opportunity to advance if you worked hard enough
good,"Great environment to work!  Everyone is friendly and very helpful.  Plenty of opportunity to advance with this company.  There are some difficult customers, but overall the job is not hard."
good,Home Depot offers a career path that is only limited by your desire to work hard and learn. Many of the executives started out as part time cashiers or lot associates.  Benefits are available to both P/T and F/T associates.
good,"Home Depot gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about electrical , hardware and plumbing. There was a lot of training which was great. Great coworkers to help answer challenging questions, for example the was and expert plumber and electrician that was working which taught me so much about each trade. Very challenging place to work at times which always made me want to learn more to be able to help customers with more technical questions."
good,hardest part of customer service is helping rude customers. You learn how to tackle situations that seem that cannot be fixed at all. Returns and orders is a typical day at work.
good,"Home depot felt like a second family. Had great time will all in the store. Very fast paced. Worked in busiest store in Orange county. Management, in general, is supportive. Was able to think outside the box on projects and merchandising. Although Home Depot does also have Corp merchandise standards, one still has ""outside the box"" input.. Environment was enjoyable. Ones shift went by very fast. Trained associates to be promoted. Dealt with customer sat issues. Audited numerous forms of reports. Financial, sales, inventory and operational."
good,A on and off busy schedule ay home depot left workers stressed but for the most part it was a fun job with cool employees. I would recommend anyone who is looking for a job.
good,"and overall good job if you don't mind leaving at 1 a.m. all the time,  even though you were supposed to leave at 11:30 pm. Co-workers are really good though."
good,"This jobs allows for me to interact with adults more.  I have a wonderful time just being friendly and holding conversations with the customers, providing them with great service, and the opportunity to problem solve with them."
good,You definitely get moved up quickly. Great place to start careers and learn in home products. Great Learning experience for beginners who would like to know and learn A LOT about in home products.
good,You have to be willing to understand everything is about the customer. What you feel about it doesn't matter. You have to learn to put your feelings aside often.
good,the job at all is challenging and joyful for whom is interested in technical positions.i liked the job and will recommend it to others who like challenging with customers needs .
good,"Many great benefits are available (the most I've ever seen), employee's concerns are considered through frequent meetings, and full-time employees are guaranteed 40 hours per week."
good,Home Depot has a customer first mentality which I admire. They also helped with advancement if it was something you desired. Great training and mentorships if desired.
good,We come in the store at 10 pm at night and then we proceed to the office room and everybody find out what isles they are responsible from 10 pm to 6 am in the morning where ever you assigned you are responsible for it throughout the night. The work place culture is more like family based everybody looks out for everybody and everybody is considered to be basically family. The hardest part sometimes is staying up all night  when my body feels as if i could have gotten more sleep. The most enjoyable part is when you finish all the work you were assigned in a timely fashion
good,Me gusto mucho trabajar en esta empresa es muy humana e inclusiva
good,Safe and friendly work environment. Job security is good and there are various departments to work at and gain experience. There are always opportunities for advancement.
good,working in Atlanta is great but outside of Atlanta not as good the management is not on the same level or work on the same level as Atlanta needs a lot of help
good,la cultura laboral de cuidar al trabajador es  excelente
good,Great place to work.  Great team environment.  Opportunity to help people with their home renovations.  Allowed me to share my knowledge with people who were ready and willing to learn.
good,Everyone I met at The Home Depot was welcoming and easy to work with. The IT team I worked with worked hard and played hard all the time. The four month co-op I spent at Home Depot was a great learning experience.
good,"Team work is great, everyone is willing to help each other on task. Everyone is treated with respect and it is easy to ask questions. easy to make friends with in the team and store"
good,"At The Home Depot, I felt as if I was given the opportunity to advance my career in many ways just by working hard and being a helpful part of the company team. This is something that I feel a large amount of companies don't provide anymore and my experience was a positive one in every way."
good,"Home Depot was a great company to work for. I had just had a baby and my drive was far, and the manger didn't want to work with my schedule. So i had to leave it really sucked, but i had to do what I had to do."
good,"I'd recommend everyone work at Home Depot at one point in their life. Its a great place with great people, but it is still retail. As far as I can tell though, it is the best retailer for employees out there."
good,I enjoyed working at Home Depot loved the people at 2407 and would still be there if the pay had been better for what i was doing.It was always a team atmosphere.
good,"unload and load trucks, receive and ship all the freight and product"
good,"the job was very demanding and understaffed, pay isn't very competitive but the options are limitless, most managers are very friendly and willing to help"
good,"Everyone looked out for each other and its truly like a family. The job was simple, but you have to know your stuff because everyone treats you like a walking google. You aren't asked which mower you have in stock is better, you are asked how to mow this customers specific lawn that you have never seen."
good,All the coworkers were like family and the managers were always understanding. Customers were nice most of the time so it made the workplace a fun and active place to be in.
good,"The higher ups at this place were great! So understanding and friendly, it really did feel like a family at times. Even when the work was too hard sometimes, the people made it better."
good,I say that because it has a lot of benefits to offer. It offer visions insurance and few others i cant think of at this moment. Manager was really nice. Second best manager I've had since i been working.
good,Gotta be good at sales. I enjoyed it but not good at talking or selling.  It was my first job after 9 yrs. Very hard for me but over came it. If I went back I'd want to be a cashier.
good,"The Store Manager and the Associate Managers were a pleasure to work with even when we were under staffed.  Speaking of understaffed, my impression was that most Home Depots had that problem, especially during the summer.  I felt like I constantly had the work load of 3 employees."
good,"All you have to do is help customers find items and sell, sell, sell. you pretty much learn as you go working here. A lot of professionals shop here and you can learn from them. if you are not sure about something look it up or read the package"
good,I worked at both the store and the distribution center. Home Depot had plenty of employee perks ans treated the employees well with plenty of room for advancement. Overall they are a good employer.
good,"HD is a great company that knows how to take care of people internally ( associates) or externally ( customers) "
good,"i really enjoy working at home depot, the coworkers are great and so is the management. being part time sometimes was not that good, which is why I am now looking for a full time job."
good,"Working for The Home Depot for 20 years gave me the opportunity to make contacts and build working relationships with people of diverse talent.  The company overall offers great benefits- life, health, dental,and vision- and in a management position a chance to bonus every 6 months"

Read contractors  blueprints.  Visit contractors and managers of construction projects on location to consult new and improved inventory that each company may benefits from."
good,"Decent place to work and the staff were all really friendly, including management. They weren't clear about certain things in the job description however, such as the fact that I would be made to push carts for the entire day rather than cashiering at least once a week."
good,It is a great place to work. All of the managers were awesome and they all have your back. My department supervisor was a very hard working knowledgeable guy. If it wasn’t for the pay I would stay there as long as I could.
good,"A typical day is listening to customers in the store or handling calls from customers who may be upset about an order that didn't go the way they wanted it to and trying to resolve that problem before it gets out of hand. Over the years, I've learned how to listen to customers and solve their problems in a timely manner. I have also worked to develop associates on their job responsibilities so as to prevent future issues. Management has changed over the years, some good, some bad, but overall, Home Depot is pretty good about holding their associates accountable. The workplace is laid back since you work in a warehouse environment, but that doesn't mean that lack of staff or products doesn't prevent customers from giving you a piece of their mind. The hardest part of the job is being yelled at or berated by customers who are unhappy with an issue that you had no involvement in creating. The most enjoyable part of the job, is the camaraderie you share with the other associates. Retail can be a very difficult job, but your fellow co-workers usually help you to keep your head above water."
good,"Corporate office was fun place to work, lots of interactions."
good,Good company for the most part....when the whole gas shortage thing happen....they sent a tanker full of gas to fill up the employees cars and trucks. But moving up or trying to learn different things aren't as easy as they say...go figure.
good,"Realizaba chequeo de mi pasillo diariamente, revisaba que no ubiera faltante de mercancia, que la mercancia de alto valor tuviera la verificacion de quality control, estoqueaba mi pasillo y acomodaba mercancia en over, realizaba conteos ciclicos y de coin semanalmente, brindaba una excenlente atencion al cliente y completaba sus proyectos brindandoles informacion certera sobre lo que compraban. se les brindaba asesoria tecnica por departamento a todos los clientes y se impartian talleres sobre el departamento en este caso iluminacion, se hacia el cambio de precios diariamente y revision de etiquetas pop. Recomendabamos y promocionabamos la tarjeta bancaria de the home depot e iba a reclutar personal (hunting) si era necesario. En the home depot no discriminaban el sexo de las personas, y se realizaban todo tipo de festivales conforme las fechas lo indicaban, respecto a la gerencia; Siempre me dejo a desear cosas negativas. La parte mas dificil del trabajo fue el abasteciemiento de la mercancia para el cliente, lo cual nos llevaba a  problemas por promesas falsas, a fin de entregar mercancia no existente. Lo que mas me gusto del trabajo fue la motivacion y las ganas de sobresalir, fue una empresa que me enseño bastante, estoy satisfecho en lo que aprendi en the home depot."
good,"During my time at Home Depot, it has been a wonderful experience learning and growing my skills in customer service and retail knowledge is valuable and can be useful in everyday life. The culture at Home Depot is comfortable and sociable where you can have open conversations in a safe work environment, which has always motivated me to work harder and smarter when it comes to working in home improvement industry which Home Depot is a big part of. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interactions I have with nice, social individuals who I can have a quick chat with to build a strong relationship with company and consumers. The hardest part of the job would be when it gets very busy especially during the summer season, the work is at a much faster pace which can be stressful at moments. Overall, the workplace is constant, the environment is friendly and especially the staff are friendly, informative, and there willingness to help every customer with their questions and concerns."
good,"Fun place to work, the goals arn't outrageous and cutthroat to the point where coworkers won't help out others which makes it a comfortable enviroment. Plenty of opportunity for advancement or switch to different roles every 6 months. They offer Voluntary time off.. almost every day which helps alot!"
good,A typical day at the rlc 8617 was always filled with energy. It was laid  back but could instantly get overwhelmed with product. because of the family atmosphere always made it easy to work day by day.
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work, it's fast paced, you get bonuses every 6 months, the 401k plan is awesome when you give 5% of your pay Home Depot  will match it."
good,It's a great place to work at. Some might say their uncaring or a waste of time. Which is not true it all depends on you. How much you are willing to learn. How much your willing help out when needed. It's a team effort. Everyone helps everyone to get what needs to get done. Lots of opportunities for advancement. Many ways to involve yourself. I learned a lot and would never change the experience I had with them.
good,"Great money , no work life balance , great benefits and perks , 401 k and stock option is amazing , but working 60 hours a week on 6 days every week is not fun ."
good,"well organized work pace, great management and communication with employees, what is expected of them each shift, but very understanding that costumers come first.."
good,"Coming out of a commissioned job and going into an hourly position, although a leadership role, was a shock...mostly to my bank account. They get a bargain having someone of my experience running a multi-million dollar specialty department for what I am paid."
good,"I was lucky enough to work at a Home Depot (Oxon Hill, MD.), where the atmosphere was friendly and welcoming. Every assignment I completed was praised by my managers. If there was something I didn't know, their was always a co worker to assist and encourage me. The store and my department managers, both excellent people to work for."

good,"great workplace, with many opportunities for advancement, this company is more than willing to train all employees to the fullest. benefits and profit sharing."
good,its a great place to grow and learn to work with people with different backgrounds. To be poised in times of stress and huge volume of customers with different needs.Multi task
good,"The people in my team were great to worked with. The particular store I was assigned would sponsor a Christmas Party and that was pretty much it. A typical day consisted of a team meeting first thing in the morning when we got in, followed my get to work, greet and help some customers out, 15 minute coffee break, back to work, coffee break, work, lunch, assist customers, work, go home. I was given some training on a forklift which was great, but not given much opportunity to actually apply my training. The team leader had her favorite forklift driver. Learned how to read and set shelves based on planograms. All and all it was a good experience but very little to no chance for advancement. Having been in IT (computer programmer) for 32 years where the pace was faster and more exciting this job became to null and routine."
good,Everyone was help and the team was great. Genuinely honest staff and good team work ethic. Unfortunately there was significant manager and employee turnover but for a retail job this is a really good place to work. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in a retail job.

good,Home Depot promoted form within.  I was able to work my way up with relocation help.  Impressive ESPP plan.  Good stock options for management.  Unfortunately the labor system took too many orange aprons off the sales floor.
good,"Always scheduled your breaks and lunch with the choice of 30 minutes or an hour, kind staff and good with taking time off and working with your schedule"
good,Since i started it has been fun working there. Yea you are gonna have some days where anything and everything annoys you but at the end of the day the most important thing to remember is just to have fun at work make it a place you wanna come to instead of a place you dont even wanna think about. Management is cool.
good,"Must have good customer skills and able to answer customer's questions.  There's always something to do.  Fixing shelves, stocking aisles, helping customers pick out their needs.  People are like family and treat each other nicely."
good,The Home depot is a great company to work for. I have worked there for over 6 years and have enjoyed it tremendously. The people are friendly and there is a great culture and values present there.
good,"Typical day was helping customers as needed and straightening up work area.  "
good,"Customer service is The Home Depot's number one priority along with everyone's safety. Co-workers are typically good people, including management. You are always on the go while on the clock (helping customers and maintaining your department). They allow 15 minute breaks along with 30 minute lunches. The phones ring pretty frequently with customer question or a co-worker asking for assistance. Home Depot gives their employees product knowledge training. Be able to work as a team, but also having your own responsibilities. Learning lots of new information."

I've learned how to work the service desk and the registers. Management was good and they were very flexible with scheduling and availability. They were also open to employees wanting to learn new departments or switch departments if there was an opening. Any problems at work were quickly resolved and fixed, I appreciated that. The workplace is very friendly and family like- there are tons of happy employees ranging from 16 to "
good,Home Depot is a good company to work for and has great benefits and plenty of advancement opportunities for their employees and I would highly recommend this company for someone just starting out in their career.
good,"Great place to work, but one strange thing about home Depot customers is that the customer somehow expects the cashier to unload their merchandise onto the checkout counter..... Weird."
good,good environment and great team work. i try to get out 5 loads a day or more the company was good and treated me well the company was a good start for forklift drivers and got me into stock
good,Typical day at work would be meeting allot of people and finding solutions to their problems by having allot of product knowledge that you learn from other co workers on the job. the workplace culture was very diverse. the hardest part of the job was learning all the products and what they do. most enjoyable part was meeting lots of people.
good,Only Part Time work offered. Good company pay and benefits profit sharing plan. worked nights and weekends heavy lifting depending on the department you are in.

good,A typical day at work is I go in unload a truck either put freight away or bay directed pack down. I learned how to use two lift trucks such as the pacer and the EPJ (Electric Pellet Jack). the Management to good at least in the store I was in. Work place culture is depend's on who you ask I just show up and work. I can't really tell what the hardest part of the job is as it is a straight forward kind of work easy to learn.
good,"My time at Home Depot usually started in the early evening until late at night. The primary focus was to make sure that the customers came first and was taken care of in a timely and efficient manner.  The hardest part of the job was when they were short staffed, not enough cashiers to fill the needs of the many customers who come through the doors and all with many and different demands.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when the lines were short and there was plenty of help which made the day a lot easier."
good,"This company doesn't pay the best, but their benefits are awesome and you don't have to be full-time to enjoy most of them. Aside from the great medical and dental, they match your 401k, you get stock at a discount, and you receive discounts on many places around the city."

good,"Very nice place to work. Co workers are always friendly and hard working. Environment is polite and relaxed but productive and driven to meet goals. Always trying to please customers. I made a lot of friends there and always felt comfortable. I received good pay, hours to work and help from the management. The hardest part of the job for me was standing for long periods of time and the best part of the job was the mature, friendly, diligent atmosphere."
good,A typical day would consist of going to your area of work and standing there for 10 hours a day doing that job function. You become a pro at your functions. You gotta work at a steady pace though to maintain a good percentage rate.

good,"Coworkers made it all better. Made great friendships and management did try to work with you on personal problems. "
good,Great people to work for and with. Only complaint would be better communication of company goals and how to better implement them. Typical corporate attitude of how to do things with little input from the workers on how to improve. Co-workers were great at both stores I worked at.
good,"Hardest part for me was learning the hand-held inventory device, which interfered with work efficiency. Had 2 systems instead of just 1. Procedures on it varied and I'd recommend min of 1 day classroom or virtual training on a computer to learn it instead of strictly on-the-job. Not only had to punch time-clock for breaks but also had to exit out of project on hand-held device. Would forget to do that sometimes."
good,"the store manger would yell at person out loud and scare me,"
good,"Very team oriented, Opportunity to use machine equipment, takes initiative to do well. Enjoy interacting with the customers as well as my fellow coworkers.  Management is very pro safety and not afraid to get dirty with the floor associates if necessary."
good,At times stressful but a good job. Often unrealistic expectations given to associates by management and often under staffed. Company promotes from within and has great values. Success depends upon individual to be a part of the team. Often have to work under staffed and in multiple departments while accomplishing daily tasks.

good,Working at The Home Depot was a great experience. Management changed and made the environment a little different. But overall as a company it was great.

good,"At this job I had to really learn how to move fast and become very precise when it comes to counting items and being sure I have scanned every item. Hardest part of work was standing for many hours, which is something I can do, but it was tiring at first. Work place was very friendly and calm, co workers were easy to talk to."
good,The Home Depot encourages a feeling of family among employees and customers. Employees support each other and they are rewarded for acts of service. Employees and especially managers make a concerted effort to give the customer the best experience possible and strive to help in whatever way they can.

good,"A typical day at work involves helping customers shop while doing the tasks or things pertaining to your department. There is a lot to learn from Home Depot. Customers are friendly and love giving lessons and knowledge about what they know about getting a job done. Management is cool. The relationship with management is what you make it, and it can be very beneficial and helpful if you have a strong relationship with management. Communication is key. The workplace culture is family and friend oriented. Everyone is always willing to lend a hand in getting the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job is that everyday is different. You never know exactly what you're going to need to do when you start."
good,"Great , I wish I started there when I was 17 or 18 not now ...It's a great company to build a career out of not to start working there when you are in your 30s  because you start at a dollar above minimum wage and you need to work hard .."
good,"Immersed in the HD culture... you drink the ""Orange"" Kool Aid and you are hooked. Very good working conditions for a home improvement store, spacious and large break room area, training was very adequate and thorough. A lot of favoritism... if your SM and ASM's like you, you will go far."
good,Lots of work balance and flexibility with schedule managers and Human resources works with your schedule. Benefits are really good and they now have set schedules makes it easier to plan your days.
good,"The beginning of my shift as freight supervisor was to walk the floor and receiving to count how many pallets of freight came in and which departments would need the most help. I then held a nightly meeting with my staff, to go over the night's assignments and to discuss the profit and loss of the store. Then to the floor to put freight away, receive trucks, and determine what freight would go directly overhead prior to the end of the shift. "

good,Help general public in all areas. Learned a lot about different building products . Management is good and fair. Very diverse place to work. Helping customers find the products they are looking for.
good,Working at the Home Depot allows you to work in a semi fast-paced environment while still feeling relaxed. The people you work with are supportive and will help you if you need it. Management has an appreciation for employees and often give rewards and incentives. I would recommend this place as a great place to work.
good,Buena empresa con áreas confortables para trabajar crecimiento y superación
good,Good place for younger people to work if they want to work for a company for 20 years or more. Most people who are hired are hired for a part time job only. You have to work there about six months before you become full time.
good,"My work at Home Depot was among my most productive and while I left for my family, my job was both fulfilling and fun. I worked bard, but so did everyone."
good,Managment was really great about working around my class and study hours.  They pay wasn't amazing however they do have profit sharing and gave out gifts around holidays.

good,"While working as a lot attendant, I learned a lot. Became more familiar with securing merchandise and got to work with a lot of good people. Definitely helped with my customer service skills as I was dealing with customers throughout my shift."
good,Only thing missing is more hours for part timers. Other than that people are great to work with. Supervisors are always nice and helpful. Co-workers enjoy their jobs too.
good,"There will always be challenging opportunities to work on, and talented, fun people to work with. However, because of how flat the organization runs, it becomes very difficult to move up."
good,"A typical day of Home Depot was coming in everybody would say hi. I always felt I was part of the team . Everybody would put their heads and efforts together to make a great name for Home Depot. My Team (Receiving/Freight) were so great we won the Best Freight Team in the Southwest Division. I learned a lot working there. All the nuts and bolts.... no pun intended...of working there. It was a very interesting place to work. So much to learn. That in it's self was a little hard, but fun never the less. But getting are Award for Best Freight team in the Southwest Division said it all for me, You should strive to do your best.... it always seems the best for the company and you. My hats off to our great management team for instilling a great work ethic and passing off their skills to better our efforts."
good,"All the mangers and associates got along, but at times it work get really busy and customers would make a mess and throw everything everywhere. Could get Stressful at times"
good,Learn a lot about logistics and warehouse work.  Very good opportunity to promote from within.  Decent benefits for health care and vision and dental care.
good,My day is mainly about pushing carts and loading merchandise into customers vehicles. I love all of my co workers and upper management. When ever their is a slow day our MOD always have something for me to do to help around the store. Due to their helpful app I can help most customers problems that they come up to me for which is a huge plus. However the hardest part is they tend to keep us under staffed. I often am the only lot associate and have to handle multiple loading calls at the same time while keeping the lot cleared of carts.
good,"I love working in the paint department, and you start to remember your customers. The training is easy, and if you do what you are supposed to do, they will help you grow."
good,Met team is payed by vendors  does not get payed from Home depot Company themselves. Very good thing about it is set schedule and all the benefits you get. No set schedule for store side but would be less stressful in some cases.
good,A work day at The Home Depot usually started pretty relaxed. We were only really busy when we had promotions or sales going on in store. I learned how to give good customer service and to also handle a tuff situation at work like an unhappy customer or a customer that was attempting to leave the store with merchandise.
good,The job was pretty easy. Although it may get hectic during the holidays. I loved the team I worked with. The most enjoyable part of the job are the different projects I got to work on.

good,"Worked the overnight shift, I would come in at 8pm start at 9pm and work till 6am. One hour lunches, and for holidays the manager would BBQ hotdogs and burgers, and we would have other food available. At time the manager would buy pizza for the crew when we worked a certain amount of containers in a week."
good,"A typical day at work was to first check for any possible safety issues, making sure that floors and areas were free of objects that might get on customers ways. The most important thing was to welcome customers and made them feel as if they were at home. Customers were wonderful. The management was good, they were always there to help if we ever needed help. The culture was very diverse, people from all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job was not to have customers, for that used to make the job itself boring. Customers are the essential element at Home Depot. The most enjoyable part of the job was taking care of the customers and working with my co-workers."
good,"working at home depot was the best experience of my life. management was excellent, the customers were friendly. weekends were absolutely insane, but it was very fulfilling work. i completely enjoyed it...with certain exceptions."
good,Not a difficult job and and enjoyable establishment to work. Management is fair and understand. I would recommend family and friends work for the company.
good,"Fast-Paced with lots of work available, Worked a lot of hours, can be stressful at times.  Employees were great to work with.  Employees help you to succeed."
good,"I learned that a good crew can get stuff done."

good,"Great job, not stressful, very cooperative team. "
good,"Homedepot was a great place to work for had great management and always had opportunities for advancement great costomer service aswell, they have a program that is there to help families in need which is amazing as well."
good,"A day not knowing how customers are gonna react positive or negative."
good,"It can be fast paced during the high seasons when you first step onto the floor. Your are encouraged to boost sales, work as a team, and not give in to emotions. In stead you learn to assess the situation and chose the proper and professional way that is best to help your customer. It is a customer oriented work place that also takes into account the welfare of its workers and employees. Safety is key in every corner of the store. The hardest part of the job is not being able to help a customer who came in just to yell or vent. The most enjoyable part of the job is to see that same customer change his or her frown into a smile or help someone beyond what is usually possible to achieve results that even the customer is astounded at the adequacy of the employee. The same thing can be said among its employees. Encouraging ones fellow worker in a hard time or place can make all the difference to him or her for the rest of the day."
good,"nice place to work, mainly for teenagers and people who are looking for a great opportunity to invest in stocks and 401k. Family environment is good and there is room to grow if you plan on being there for the long hall."

good,learned a lot from various supervisors and managers fast paced some days were heavy some days were light you must be able to work with  different races and you must be customer service friendly
good,"The staff is excellent. "
good,"Hot mess comes to mind. At this time they were making changes in our store to having no store manager, to getting a new one and he left, to get another."

good,Home Depot was a fun place to work. They are very flexible with hours especially to those who are going to school. Their benefits are great. The only critique I have is that their communication skills need some work.
good,Comfortable and safe workplace with flexible hours and friendly management. Great job for growth and improvment throughout the store and within yourself.
good,"➢	Perform Inventory control. "
good,"The day starts when I clock in and check in with the head cashier to go over current duties as well as for the day. Throughout the day I go to different stations such as garden, self check out, main check stands and occasionally returns. The head cashier will usually decide where I will be stationed and when to give fellow checkers their breaks. While doing my checking duties, I learned how to work with different needs of consumers. Each station requires a approach different from the other specially returns. The management of the store I work for are very fun to work with. They are very professional when needed but they are mostly down to earth. The hardest part of my job is when something goes wrong with a product I am ringing up for a customer. The co-workers are the part of my job I enjoy the most."
good,Home depot was starter company in my career. It offered a means to learn how to handle customers and employees.. My only negative is that I feel like the pay could be more competitive.. I didnt think I was paid enough for the amount of wear and tear the positions can put of your body
good,"you get great training, and the benefits are very good. I like working with and servicing people from all different cultures and back grounds. The management was okay but they can be better. The hardest part of the job was being honest when it came to VOC. Because if the customers don't complete the online surveys, that counts against you and you can lose your position to someone who might not be honest and save their receipts and complete their own surveys. The most enjoyable part of this job was that your co-workers are more like family and success sharing was one of my all time favorites."
good,"I personally loved Home Depot the benifits were amazing, and the community was great I regret leaving this company. "
good,"Unload the truck, stock the store, and then clean and make sure the store is ready for the next day. Its all a process that takes everyone working together to be successfully completed."
good,A typical day at home depot is unprofaned experience because you never know what you gonna get from the consumer. Because the consumer come no matter what and sometime the consumer can make your day or destroy but no matter what it feel good helping people get what they need done.
good,"Ive been working here since march and ive liked it a lot, however the managers dont seem to communicate very well with the employees. They never mention how to move up, i had to figure that out on my own, but the people that work there are friendly and good to talk to. Managers work well with your schedule and are flexible if you need the odd day off. Overall nice place to work."
good,This place is a great place for a first job. Nice people and chill environment. Can get really busy sometimes but thats normal. Always someone there to ask questions if you need it. Better than working in fast food.
good,A guy over me was always asking saying racist things to me so it got uncomfortable so I left it was very horrible to go threw that everyday and it started as soon as I started the night shift with Walmart as if I was his target and I was the only black working the over night shift
good,Great management from the top all the way down . Good culture and I wish I never left for more monetary compensation . Good family and very community rooted .
good,I started off down stocking all of the kitchen cabinets and I went around and helped other departments and with there stocking. I then would sit down with a clients double check with their measurements and make sure that they have them all.  then we would sit down and begin to design their idea of what they want for a kitchen design and do what we there space provides for us to do. when done help out in other departments until time to go home.
good,Working at the Home Depot was a good experience for a young student as myself and I would recommend a friend to work there if they are going to school because they are flexible with schedules
good,". It was productive had something to do a lot of the time "
good,"Millions of people in the store all asking you different questions but they're nice and understanding. I learned that speed and smiles will take you far and even how to mix paint. Majority of the store managers are understanding and care about your well being. Everyone is friendly to one another and care about well-being. the hardest part of job would be ""power hours"" the time period when everyone want to shop. The most enjoyable part about the job would be the friends you make and laughing and joking when you see them around the store"
good,at Home Depot I learned how to better assist customers and the different needs they have. The holidays are usually the hardest time of the year due to so many customers and sales going on.
good,"Everyone is really friendly and understanding. The managers are very helpful and always willing to help you however they can. More times than not, you always had happy, friendly customers who loved to joke with employees."
good,Home Depot is great place to work. However where I worked there was a lot of teenagers because it is located next to a high school. I guess that can be a pro in some ways because not a lot of employers like employing teens.
good,good job everything about it is good pay people advancement is something that will happen all your home needs helping people understand there home good trainning
good,Home Depot was a very good place to work.  The working environment was pleasant and the staff was easy to work with.  Management always was available to listen to employee suggestions in order to improve the electrical department.
good,"Working for the Home Depot was definitely one of the better employment choices I have made. You truly get taken care of by management. They provide frequent breaks, which is a very good thing because you will spend long hours standing on concrete. Overall, the location I worked at was very mellow and my coworkers were very pleasant."
good,Greet managers get tasks from them and complete within shift have good time with cowokers and get her done type of crew its a great woks place to be .

good,I enjoyed being employed at the Home Depot... Compensation was fair and competitive... Anytime an employee wanted to further their training they were willing... Allowing associates to further their growth in the company.
good,The Home Depot has adapted to the ever changing times and technology. There are generally good management teams in place. One of the most important things to remember is be on time and follow your schedule. Attendance is the main reason for terminations for even the most tenured staff. Fairly good pay and benefits. Morale is generally good. They take care of their employees and reward them often.
good,"Supportive management team, Coworkers work together to obtain the best for their customers.  Positive feedback on a regular basis.  Lot of schedule flexibility."
good,Company is very good to its employees. The manager in my store is wonderful and is willing to do anything he asks of his employees. The only downside to the store is that there seems to be very few opportunities for full time.
good,Fue una de las Empresas donde logre grandes objetivos
good,The day begins with meeting with all shirt workers in the break room and department meeting in your area. After that your day begins by working an eight hour shifts. I learned how to use an scan gun and drive an stand up forklift. additions jobs were to unlaid and load a truck with freight. The managernment was fare and helpful in helping workers to succesed in there jobs. The culture was an good envoriment to work in. The hardest part of the was getting the work done with least people and most enjoyable part of the job was worker together and accomplished the job at hand.
good,"I was on the MET team so I don't know how it is for store associates but my team was excellent led by an amazing supervisor. Great work environment, and a good wage for the area i was in."
good,very good job this is one of my best jobs i hated to leave but if i didnt have my heart set on my goals in another field i wouldve stayed here and moved up its a very fun place to work everybody is family and i enjoyed it and meeting the customers
good,"-The hours for a Merchandise Execution Associate are 6 am-10am for part time. 6 am to 2:30 pm for full time. It's great to get off early, it leaves plenty of time for a social life. Off weekends and holidays."
good,Great company!! Excellent service!! Lasting Impression!! I had the opportunity to meet great people. Management is very involved in day to day operations and do not mind helping!!
good,"You know what you're getting into everyday for work and if there are any curveballs it's nothing that can't be done in a few hours. Management has always been very open and understanding, you almost forget they're there. It is retail though so prepare yourself to answer the same ten questions every day. What makes my job much easier is that you're given the ability to discount up to $50 for whatever reason so if you get the occasional cheapskate who wants a discount for everything there's no need to involve management. In virginia I started off at $10.50 and am now paid $12.50 after six years so don't expect much in the way of raises without going into management. A really nice low-key and stable job though."
good,Fun place to work but can get very busy. The pay is good the benefits are good. You can go to full time from part time if you do your job and work hard add learn as much as u can
good,"Pretty decent job, especially for entry level. Room for advancement. Moved up to a supervisor position within 2 years by just doing my job and showing initiative."
good,"My time with home depot I enjoyed it greatly, management at least at my store was lax about things which did cause an increase in work load, but overall was enjoyable. Only reason I left was promotions and raises don't come as often as they should and people that do get promoted only do so because they yell and complain or have been there longer. The ones who complain don't get very far after becoming a department head though."
good,Fantastic place to work.  Hard work is recognized and compensated.  Work life balance at management level is difficult.  Ever changing schedule and 11 hour days.
good,"The Home Depot is a good place to work. You learn good customer service skills. Also, gives employees other options to further their carrier within the company."
good,For my first retail type of job. Home Depot has been really good to me and even worked with me with hours. its a vary student friendly job to work at. Also I love my managers there. My Frieght Team might be low in numbers but we still make the best out of a dull issues that seem to pop up everywhere.
good,Everyone gets along with everyone that works there. Fun place to work at. They are good with flexibility with your schedule if you need them to be. They offer great benefits.

good,"I enjoyed my time here, the environment was great and I personally enjoy working on a night crew. I was well suited to the job and would consider something similar."
good,you have to be a people person to work here if you let yourself get influence for other your life could get really miserable here focus stand for our values and the sky is the limit
good,"es una buena empresa ,el salario es muy competitivo  en el ramo de ventas retail..se tiene que rolar turnos no hay un horario fijo ..areas de crecimiento a mediano y largo plazo ..las diferentes areas de gerencia y direccion tratan de apoyar siempre a su personal ..se tiene bastatnte trato con los clientes internos y externos lo que hace agradable el trabajo y un gusto por la atencion a clientes,falta un poco de personal por lo que el trabajo a veces resulta un poco estresante..en terminos generales..le doy una calificacion de 8 a 9.."
good,My days were typically busy and I had a very good manager.  I liked the atmosphere and interacting with the customers. Home depot has very good benefits.
good,I learned how to interact with customers at a fast pace due to the fact that they had a lot of customers day in and day out. I learned how to safely load heavy products for customers and how to operate a propane kiosk.
good,"nice place to work at very friendly staff, you are responsible for customer service, and clean up, Learn lots about how fix things around your house, and management is good at increasing knowledge."
good,"Very employee oriented workplace, personable management and 'the wearin of the orange apron' is your badge for being a part of The Home Depot high quality experience.  Just be prepared to be on your feet on a concrete floor constantly.  You rarely get to sit."
good,"L'équipe a boisbriand est vraiment exeptionelle toujours agréable de travailler avec eux."
good,"Company provides great benefits to PT and FT associates. Overnight shifts are compensated well, but the schedule is hard.The leadership is okay. Company has long term growth potential"
good,Very good experience working for Home Depot. Very good management and good overall work environment. Managers and upper management is caring and supportive. If you are eager to go forward management will provide all tools and support you need to go up.
good,"It's a good company to work for, with flexible hours. I love meeting new people and making a connection with them. There are a lot of different departments with many opportunities to advance."
good,"Day always started with me greeting the employees. Typical day would consist of QA's 1 on 1's, and supervisor meetings."
good,I like working with Home Depot nice people and managers just not enough hours a week. If they offer more hours a week it would be a perfect job.But other than that i love it.
good,Employees at home depot are very approachable and friendly.They really provide a great customer service to their customers and gives values to every compliments and achievements that they receive
good,"Helping customers complete their project needs. Product ordering,transfer of product,and inventory control. Generating new business for doors and windows.Setting measurements and installs for doors and windows.Interfacing with vendors for solving install issues.The most enjoyable part of the job is having repeat customers asking for your help and the smiles that came with them. Receiving positive feed back about their experience with our services and products."
good,enjoyed working there. they always took care of their employees and were always looking out for us. They did a lot to keep us excited to come to work. I miss the environment and the holidays with our home depot family.
good,"Here at the home depot everyone works as a team and has the same objective, to help our customers and achieve our goals. The only con of this job is that it is very difficult to get full time here."
good,i have worked for the home depot for a little over a year and my experience with the company has been shaky at best and the pay and benefits are not that great but the people are amazing
good,Frequent management changes could make things a bit chaotic at times. Given lots of opportunity to work at different departments at the store and aquire product knowledge.
good,"On busy days you will be frequently asked to do objectives at the same time and receive backlash if you cannot do the objectives within a short period of time. On days that was average or not busy most of the time spent was organizing products and making the store look presentable. Co-workers was typically nice people, but you will get one or two people who your will try to avoid. The hardest part of this job is learning the products in the warehouse. If a person do not have previous general knowledge of the products in your department than you are required to literally learn from experience. You are required to give people advise on products you know nothing about and if you do not attempt to give that costumer advice on the product than you will receive backlash from the costumer and the manager."
good,"A typical workday is about 6-8 hours depending on if you're part time or full time. I learned a lot about technology, equipment, and how the culture is at home improvement stores. The experience depends on the management. My experience was pretty cool."
good,"Home depot is a great company to work for.  Great benefits, good pay. Management is strong and fair. Diverse culture. Our scheduling allows a great balance between work and home."
good,"Home Depot has its ups and downs to the job, but overall its good. The management is not well at all. They make too many errors, and most mangers are too uptight or hard on workers. Hardest part with being a freight member is unloading the truck. Heavy equipment can put a strain on your body. After that packing out and stocking up is easy for the most part."
good,"Home depot gave me a good out come to refashioning your home. They gave me a chance to travel to different stores. I learned a lot about the company resets, stocking, shipping and business. The management was great to work for as well as employees."
good,"A very fast paced and busy environment, having great customer service is very important in serving our many different clienteles. I love to interact with people customer service is one of my strongest qualities."
good,"Exelente trabajo "
good,The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers and co workers that never were willing to help or just simply didn't want to work. But getting through a rough day gets better you learn from those situations how to handle them and how to problem solve. my only complaint was i didn't feel i was growing with the company. Yes there is job security you keep your job as long as you show up to work and you get sick time hours. But it was hard getting an advancement with the company. at times people would have to wait years before getting a higher position or even a good raise. But i'm speaking on personal experience not all the other stores.
good,"I haven't been here very long, but so far it really feels like most people there care about each other. "
good,"It's an alright job. Sometimes you can be overwhelmed with carts lack of help. But most of the time it's pretty laid back. The store manager is great, willing to work with you if you need schedule changes for school or family issues. I wish I could get more hours though."
good,"Over all Home Depot was a good place, each day was something different to work on. The hardest part was getting the job done on time while helping customers. The most enjoyable part was helping people to complete their projects. The only down fall was management. They were not trained enough to handle the problems of being in charge of people."
good,"I enjoy working here. I love operating the lift trucks. i do have some trouble with some of the co workers and customers, but that seems normal wherever i work. Managers are interactive. Not happy when you stay past your scheduled time. Hardest part of the job is finding help from other associates when you need a spotter for the forklifts. Best part of the job is operating the lifts and seeing all the people you get along with and enjoy working with each day. I do wish i had a set schedule. And it is really hard to get moved from part time to full time."
good,Many benefits available. Stressful work environment. Customer service is NOT their priority. As a result most of the customers/clients are quick to lose their cool. Pay is decent. Hard work and potential for growth are recognized and encouraged.
good,Home Depot was a pretty decent work environment. Managers interacted with employees and you were acknowledged and rewarded for your work ethic. They also gave bonuses
good,home depot is a great company to work for. they care about their associates to the highest level in a wide variety of benefits and appreciation. its a warehouse so you get dirty and of course those impatient retail customers but it doesn't stop it from being a nice place to work. you can definitely grow there.
good,fun place to learn and grow in retail and fun family like atmosphere. cool people from all backgrounds that are willing to teach u all that they know.
good,Good shift lengths with decent pay. The management is willing to work with you on scheduling and has a fair disciplinary system in affect. Not a bad starting job.
good,Its a good place to work. My job is from 9pm-1am so that is pretty good. You are guaranteed a minimum of 20 hours each week.It can be fast paced on some days.
good,"I worked at the home depot for two years, was my second job. Great place, great atmosphere, excellent group of workers to be around. I'd consider working there again, however, I have since moved."
good,"At the Home Depot there is an overall sense of community. We help each other to do our work and make sure it is done in a timely manner. The management is decent and they care about us. Working in the paint department, we are expected to lift five gallon buckets of paint and one gallon buckets on a regular basis. Starting pay is average for a retail job. It is nice that they give raises every year and they have a party every six months with payouts for employees based on our overall store sales. However, we don't receive any employee discounts on merchandise. The only discounts for employees are found on a special website for employees and they are regarding things such as movie tickets, cell phone plans, and large purchases. Overall I am happy with the job."
good,Very structured work guidelines and responsibilities.  I had a lot of fun and worked hard at the same time. I would go back if I could. I worked in two different cities in Texas and even though they were very different stores (high sales Anand fast paced vs. More relaxed) I enjoyed both very much.
good,"Amazing values customer loyalty, The beginning stages of the MET Team were all trial and error. I would gladly work on the team again at the beginning it was Monday thru Friday 5 to 2 with a one house lunch hardest part of the job was a Change in Management"
good,Job is fun usually fast paced can be slow at times. Personal Experience is going to rely heavily on management. A usual day at work consists of helping customers and shelf stock maintenance.
good,Trabajar para Home Depot me ha ayudado a valorar mi trabajo y poder desempeñarme mejor en lo que hago. Trabajo como asociado del lote y algunas de mis tareas diarias es mantener el área limpia y que los carros de compras estén disponibles para los clientes.
good,This company is essential to our community for growth. It also helps with a lot of remodels. The people in this community needed a company like Home Depot for employment
good,Very busy and face pace place to work. Very good on boarding so when you actually hit the floor you know what your doing. Not to mention at that time they compensate well.
good,"Start time would vary daily. We had routines that we would do before we could hit the floor, we needed to ensure we had our previous day's sales numbers also week to date and month to date in case we were walked. I learned a lot at my 17 years at Home Depot and I can say that helped me in my customer service and over all patience when dealing with people. The hardest part of my job was getting to know so many people that worked with me on all levels and how to approach each with goals we had to set. You have to adjust to your audience after awhile I believe I mastered how to motivate. The most enjoyable was meeting new people and when I met there needs for the information they needed or got their product to them in a timely manner if there was an issue. It made me feel good to exceed their expectations."
good,"Over the past 4 years I spent at The Home Depot has definitely been a learning experience. I learned skills pertaining to 3 different jobs with the help of fellow associates, not much from management. Sometimes it is a fight trying to move to a different department. For the most part the staff is fun, but there are cliques within the company. The hardest part for me was when asking for help with lines and such, there was no sense of urgency from management or other staff members. The most enjoyable part about working here was the few people that I worked with at the desk are amazing, and a few people on the floor as well."
good,Nice place to work. Treated fairly. Plenty of advancement opp. I would definitely recommend this company for anybody. Pay is fair. Management is overall fair
good,"It is a great company to work for. The benefits for a full time employee is great. They also do a lot of things for the veterans in the community and will always help a fellow associate in need, during hard times. Has always felt like a family."
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work for many reasons. Friendly co-workers and management staff, great benefits. Tons of opportunities to learn, even outside your department."
good,"A typical work day at The Home Depot involves rounding up all shopping carts and helping customers load their products into their vehicles.  I learned to put customers first and how to better manage my time.  The management is very kind and friendly.  In the workplace, we all act as a team to ensure the customers' needs are immediately met.  The hardest part of the job is tying things down.  What I enjoy most about the job is helping customers and making them feel good."
good,Good company to work for. Works with associates school schedule. A lot of heavy lifting depending on the department. Good benifets for full-time associates.
good,"Home depot has continued to lead the way in this challenging economy. Strong culture and ecommerce Home depot stays financially strong, The people are happy and I enjoyed working for the company."
good,good working job just a part time job for me. worked there until i coulnt any longer due ti scheduling conflicts with my full time job. probably have been workable but I didn't try to see what was possible
good,"Not enough work for hiring new employees every two weeks. Plus, favoritism is their opinion on promotion, not on hard work. But 12 hour days and good pay, that's what makes up for it."
good,The Home Depot is a great place to work whether you're part time of full time. They work with you and your schedule to give you the most hours they can.
good,"Home Depot is a good place to work, for sure. The staff is friendly and mostly helpful, the pay is good and the benefits are generous. They do treat the employees well, but the customers are some of the most disrespectful and rude people I've ever met in my life. The it department can be really slow to resolve issues. Like really slow. and the scheduling can be bad at times."
good,The home depot is a usually fast paced invironment depending on what department you work in.... And requires a lot of multitasking dealing with customers and completing you daily task.
good,"customer service, customer service, driving sales, coach, train, develop, drive sales, profitability, helping others, community involvement, rewarding at times"
good,"Une super équipe en magasin avec une équipe chaleureux et solidaire."
good,"Great health benefits, company helps out the community, the company really cares about its employees, there is always something more to learn, fast paced work environment."
good,"Your experience with this company will depend on the store you work at. In general, the company has a stated culture of being the best customer service retailer, and they make steps to prove it. BUT the company has a tendency to under pay associates, and staff stores at the bare minimum."
good,Very welcoming and great working environment overall. The training is long and tedious but helps so much. Fairly easy and has plenty of opportunity for raises and promotions.
good,HomeDepot is a Family. The HomeDepot Culture is like no other. Putting Associates First. It is a rewarding job and at times stressful. As an Assistant Manager you are constinently multi- tasking. The hardest part of the job is the hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and seeing them leave happy.
good,"I worked for the Merchandizing team at The Home Depot and if you love work that's different everyday, and don't mind physical labor, it's a great position.  They don't over work anyone and it's a healthy work environment, my only complaint was the pay.  It was always a concern of mine and fortunately it's been heading in the right direction but for the amount of work done it's still quite a bit lower than it should be."
good,Great management and great perks. Just an overall great place to work. Management genuinely cares about their employees and employees are rewarding for hard work and achieving their goals.
good,I worked at the Home Depot for 2 years as a retail sales associate and I can say it has been a great learning experience for me in retail. I was able to interact with a variety of people and learn more about property management than I had with any prior experience. All in all great place with great people who value your time.
good,"The management is willing to understand and accommodate associates' with their needs."
good,Great benefits for full-time. Hourly salary could be better. No real possibility for advancement if working on the MET team. Enjoyed working on the night shift.
good,"Very professional but relaxed. Family cultured, Well lit, I learned how to up price and discount products. How to perform overviews for the financial business to its suppliers shown as liabilities. The hardest part of the job was having to sit for long periods of time balancing spreadsheets. The most enjoyable part of the job is the convenience of never having to leave the building for anything i.e. lunch, workout, dry cleaners etc."
good,"I LOVED the merchandising hours (early morning still) and how straightforward they are, the team just got new supervisor. . . MUCH easier to work with than the last one. Merchandising on a team was different than what I was used to, but was so refreshing! The team is full of really kind people, who love to have fun while working hard. Management is most of the time ready to help when you need them, and the ASM's are all super helpful! Was able to maintain a healthy work/life balance while working there.  Was very sad to leave."
good,This company is focused on customer service and making the customer happy. Associates in each department work in other areas of the store for a smooth running business. The managers are involved and present.
good,The Home Depot is a company that prides itself in doing the right thing for its associates and customers. You will find yourself wondering how it is that you haven't worked here yet!
good,Being a department supervisor opens up a whole new workplace culture. You are able to work with upper-level management to develop the skills you need to achieve.
good,"Each day was spent setting up projects and maintaining the stock. "
good,"I would say my best first job I enjoyed my first 2 years learning and growing in the company, the first store manager was great friendly and approachable he listens and attends to your needs always looking to promote somebody and give positive feedback and explain what needs to be improved."
good,This is a face paced job that keeps you constantly moving. Its a great way to assist costumers meet their everyday needs. You build sales and total out transactions.
good,"The Most Enjoyable Part Of The Job Was Coming Into Work At 9pm And Completing My Department Around 12:30/1:00am Every Night Then Moving To The Next Department Helping Fellow Co-Workers Finish Their Department In A Short Period Of Time. Also, Being The One Who Everyone Called For When They Couldn't Lift A Particular Item Cause I Was The One With All The Muscles. Our Manager Made Us Wanting To Be There & Give The Best Encouragement Plus Motivation Before Starting Our Duties."
good,I bled orange. I loved this place.  I just didn't get the support I needed when I needed it while dealing with a personal issue.  The company was losing focus on the importance of engaged and present associates.  There were never enough associates on the floor to get the job done.  Customer service was suffering at times.  I loved working with the customers and solving problems
good,"My very first job. As a the ProLoader it was my job to assist customers with loading lumber, soil, mulch, concrete etc. in their vehicle. I was the first person customers seen coming into the store and the last when they were leaving so I learned the vitals of customer service. Mostly contractors so I have a small amount of knowledge building material. I'm not much of a complainer so there was no 'hard part'"
good,"A normal day at work usually is just ringing in customers making sure they found everything they needed and the cashiers are very close with each other and love to talk and get to know each other. Hardest part of the job is just sometimes it gets slow and time goes by very slowly other than that, it is a great place to work. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you have fun with the customers and fellow coworkers."
good,"I worked overnight, unloaded trucks and stocked shelves. Managers weren't mean, but they didn't try to act like your friend. It's bearable working there. You got to listen to music, wear what you want (except open toe shoes), and you had an hour break. If I could work there again, I would. Made decent money for doing decent easy work."
good,"Great place to work. Especially if you start young. You can advance in the company very fast. Great team of people around you, to help you get to where you want to be within or outside of the company."
good,Problem solving and resolution of customer questions. Thinking quickly and accurately are skills that are used every day at work.
good,A good place to work at if your trying to move up but for regular associates the pay isn't that good they only give part timers 27 hours or less you get good benefit and 2 bonus a year the Christmas parties are cool.
good,"Flexible hours, good pay. Appreciates employees. Fun place to work, and to get some exercise! Company bbq's and parties. Good compensation."
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work if you work hard, are dedicated to your job, and above all, are patient. Home Depot will work with you to advance in the ranks and though it does not pay as well it does have excellent health, dental, and scheduling benefits. A great job culture and a management culture that is willing to listen."
good,"Everyone here is like a family and I truly love working here. The customers are always fun to work with and there is never a dull moment. Managers are pretty good and everyone is very helpful. If you are looking for a career company this is a great place for you, there are constantly associates being promoted, which is really awesome."
good,Work place is good always keeps you up to date with training. Wonderful management able to communicate with. Mixed culture well rounded. Having to cover for someone when they are not doing their job. The twice a year bonus for good customer service.
good,"Typical day at work consists of stocking shelves, helping customers find products, creating sales for customers and using a cash register to ring the customer out. I've learned 7 departments in total. Service desk, Pro desk, Tool Rental, Paint, Appliances, Bookkeeping, and Cashiering. Management is great at handing out tasks for associates to do."
good,"It was good place to learn. the pay was too low. Management was good. They teach you lots of different skills. So you are never bored. You stand for lots of the day . This is hard on feet and legs. You meet lots of different people. You can teach others how to install home improvements,"
good,I enjoyed working for this company even though some items were a bit to heavy for someone my size. Over all the management and other associates are very friendly and are willing to help at anytime.
good,"Good about managing your schedule and catering to certain needs, offers great benefits, and pay isn't half bad-you get raises consistently."
good,This company gave me a change to improve my knowledge and get promoted within a short amount of time. They take care of their associates and the community which for me is very important.
good,"very good company to work for. the only con was that part time employees did not receive any form of medical health insurance. the company did, however, provide part time associates with dental and vision."
good,Fun place to work if you like a fast pace environment and a heavy work load. managers are cool. able to advance quickly. learn alot.
good,Great treatment of employees. The gm was great. Had fun working for home depot. Had to move on when the management was fired.

good,Learned a lot from working at the home depot. Management was great. I enjoyed working with my coworkers good people. Fun place to work.
good,Company has many benefits not listed on their website that the local office participates in.  Employees are great and very caring.  Makes me proud to work at this company.
good,"In receiving it's typically a fast paced enviroment, which I loved!"
good,"Nothing to complain about with Home Depot. They provided consistent schedules, practical goals, and a safe work environment. The daily duties were quite boring, but good coworkers made up for it...pay was above minimum wage, but was still not great."
good,"I loved working here for 2 years, after said point we had a management change and shifts were altered less than 2 hours before the expected start time, hours cut drastically and managers became all but non-existent often ""hiding"" in their office for hours at a time. Still work here but won't be putting up with it after finishing college in less than a year. Start putting customers first or you will end up with Menards and Lowes rejects instead of the other way around."
good,The pay wasn't great for the amount of labor I had to do. I was never worried about losing my job. One of my problems I had with the job is my supervisor was never near me so would be hard to move up into management.
good,"they have amazing benefits, very low-key, easy going work environment. The co workers and management were great to work with, they took your outlook into consideration and plenty of room for advancement."
good,"As a Home Depot employee I have always been treated in good regard. If my flexiblility has changed the comopany was able to work with me in atimely manner. I work with great associates, have a great connection with upper personel. The Home Depot has always been good to me. There is ways to work your way up to higher placement."
good,The most enjoyable part was that helping customers find items they needed or doing freight. I was a loader so use the forklift or sometimes by hand to load heavy items in the car or on a trailer. I helped move pellets around and load some shelves up.
good,"Having worked for Home Depot for only six months, i can say that from what i have seen, the company treats their employees very well, just as long as you can perform your job great without any major problems."
good,As the  Lumber Department/ Delivery guys/Girl . Hardest workers. Flat Stack. Load. Un-Load. Load again... Always something to do and  far from the mulch people haha. Best people from one end of the store to the other that I have ever worked with and miss. I learned a lot from the pro people. This group of people all of them were there for me emotionally as well. The boss man/and woman. If something was going on they were there. Best place to work for because of the people and we cared about our customers.
good,"when I was working, we honored ourselves in knowing that we were always there for the customer. Regardless how difficult it was to find, what the customer was looking for."
good,"Awesome customer service company"
good,home depot is a good place to work but in my honest opinion the worst thing about it were the lousy customers. although not all customers were bad there were plenty of bad customers that makes me wish i wasnt working there.
good,"At the Lenoie City Home Depot, I gained more communication skills and customer service skills. Here everyone is supportive and trustworthy."
good,Home Depot provides a great work environment with plenty of guidance to succeed and room to grow. They offer a great environment for employees and great benefits.

good,This was a very productive job. Work environment was conducive for great customer service. Promotions were awarded to hard workers and workers were honored in many ways for their hard work.
good,Home depot is a strong company that has many opportunities to grow and achieve long term goals. They have a crew that is all about safety for their employees and customers.
good,"Is a great part time job when you have a full time desk job. Salary is better than most retailers and they really care about their employees. They work with your schedule and you can work just a few hours if you desire."
good,"I've worked a number of retail jobs in my day, but Home Depot was definitely the best of the bunch. The management really made a point to connect with all associates and made for a fun work environment. There was a great sense of team comradery."
good,"Pay isn't great like most retail jobs, no employee discounts and benefits aren't much. Employees are pretty nice, customers can get pretty rude though."
good,"The Home Depot is an enjoyable place to work. The coworkers here create an atmosphere that is closer to family than it is to work. The management styles differ greatly from store to store, which I learned the hard way. I would definitely suggest The Home Depot as a place to work, however it takes a long time and a lot of pushing to move up here and to get a better pay rate or more hours."
good,"As a Store Manager my day was always always exciting and unpredictable.Loved getting to know the customers and taking care of them. Loved hiring new colleagues and developing them. We always had great moral and worked as a team. No Union. As long as we were making our #'s we were left alone to make our own decisions."

good,"This a great, stable company to work for. However it is a requirement to work weekends and holidays. If you don't mind this then have at it. Plenty of advancement opportunity if you are liked by management."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed employment at this company.  great culture, team and environment.  Enjoyed everything about my employment here"
good,The home depot this a great place to work. a fun place to be yourself and also work hard. this is by far the best retail job I've had. A great place to get job experience or advance in.

good,A typical day at work includes a somewhat fast pace environment with many customers. What I learned from this job was how to balance my work schedule with my school and life schedule while also having a great time. Both management and my co-works were great to work with. The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with the many different tools and appliances in order to fit each customers needs. The most enjoyable part of the job would be being able to work in a team and meet new people.
good,One of the best things abut joining the Orange team is that you have the ability to move on up in the company in little to no time without much hassle
good,"C'est un peu avec tristesse que je veux me réorienter après 12 ans dans le même milieu de travail. La compagnie prend des décisions parfois et impose des changements au horaire qui ne convient pas à tous. C'est la seule raison qui me pousse à chercher ailleurs j'ai beaucoup appris chez home depot . Une belle culture de vente, des collègues hors pair c'est comme une famille. J'ai toucher à plusieurs départements, je sortirais de la avec un beau bagage de connaissance. Parfois un peu demandant physiquement et pas toujours l'aide souhaiter quand le besoin y est mais je crois que c'est la réalité de tous les commerces au détails."
good,"Its long hours of standing. its gud as a stepping stool unless you have nowhere else to go, in which case you must become fulltime. even with fulltime you still live paycheck to paycheck.  Now that there are set schedules its better. i am a cashier and i find the $11 an hour to be an injustice given most of the sales come through us and we also open the credit cards and new pro accounts for the store."
good,I got terminated because I went more than 6 hours without a lunch 3 times. Management switched around and the new manager went through and fired anyone with occurrences. Not taking lunch for 6 hours was an occurrence. It's the exact same as if you were late.
good,Good working environment with good employees. Worked with me with my schedule because at the time I was working 2 jobs and they understood my time management needs.
good,A great job and great people. The customers are very kind and professional.They respect the employees and always asking questions to better understand the products they are looking for.
good,I enjoy the atmosphere and co-workers.  Home Depot has a lot of great benefits for part time workers.   I work the evening shift and like that I received all the training needed to work independently.
good,"Being a cashier at the home depot, I am able to check customers out and do returns, the associates are very friendly and make it a great environment to work in. I learned how to mark products down, how to return damaged products, and how diverse it is."
good,"Picked up various sized boxes off and on the sorter and placed them on pallets."
good,I enjoyed working at the home depot. It cold be fun at times and very busy alot which kept me busy. Managment there is pretty cool they have a open door policy.
good,"Overall I believe the Home Depot is a very good place to work, the environment is very welcoming and the people are a joy to work with. My coworkers are some of the best folks I could be around and management does their best to help in whatever way is needed."
good,"worked as part of the freight team making sure shelves were stocked and ready to go. Was hired as seasonal, but kept on after that. Only given 12 hours per week. Was never told if or when the position might be gone, and was not supplied training for other departments. So my job was always up in the air."
good,"Fast pace"
good,"As a corporation, The Home Depot takes an active interest every day in providing the best in customer service while keeping in mind the employee's health and happiness in the workplace. "
good,Helping the customer was a very gratifying part of the job.   Pack down of the products kept you busy until you have another customer to serve.  It is a very team oriented place to work.
good,"Team warm ups."
good,I started out as a cashier running register and later on worked in the paint department as an associate there. I also would help clear the lot of any stray carts when needed too. Though it was a part time job I earned a cashier accuracy award twice and was employee of the month twice. after about a year and a half of cashiering I was recruited for working in paint. Since second shift workers were hard to come by the management liked to use me as a closing associate. I really liked the crew that I worked with there. The most difficult part of the job would always be stuck trying to answer an impossible question. The most enjoyable part would always be when a customer would come back to specifically have me wait on them because they liked my service.
good,"A typical day at work can range from driving the machines, Forklift, Reach Truck, Electric Pallet Jack or Operator Pickup all day to down stock or bring down merchandise for customers to simply walking around and fulfilling the customer's needs. Management are very strick and precise on what needs to be done but the work wasn't difficult at all. My coworkers played roles as help and we always worked as a team. The hardest part of my job was handling the sod, since it was all a mess. During the middle of the day under the hot sun, tossing the bad pallets out. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with other people as a team since it makes the job much easier."
good,"Count and distribute revenue daily, help customer load and unload their vehicles. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers."
good,"Great Company and long time career! Great Management. I would work at Home Depot again! Team orientated and fun place to work.Great scheduling and willing to work around your schedule, I have 4 kids and management was willing to work around my kids schedule."
good,"Great place to work with flexible work schedule. Always promoting from withing the store. No union. Work your sweat off, and you get compensated."
good,"great day to day routine, loved the coworkers. Difficult at times to delegate according to needs of customers at times. Overall a positive experience."
good,"Receiving and distributing product to departments. Overseeing employees making sure everyone did their jobs to the best of their abilities. Learning all the jobs in the store. Learning how to drive the forklift, slip sheet, reach truck and order picker. The management for the most part was wonderful. I loved all my jobs."
good,"For an overall view on this job, I really like working for Home Depot. There is always something to do, always opportunities to learn about so many different projects and products, and the people I work with genuinely care about one another. Too often companies don't care about their employees, but this one really does. Its like a family. One of the hardest parts though does seem to be the ability to move up exactly where you want in the company. Some have it easier than others, but it does seem possible."
good,"fun place to work"
good,This Company is great when it comes to its benefits but it is very hard to reach the goals of becoming full time when there aren't any hours to be given. The work experience is great overall. I have learned a lot about operations in the corporate field of employment.
good,"Start the day with warm up exercises, briefing of what needs to be done in that day then work assignments are given. Supervisors demanded independent thought and problem solving. However, supervision and backups were in place to ensure success rather than failure."
good,A easy job for someone looking for extra money. Moving freight back and forth from receiving to the shelves during third shift.
good,"A typical night at Home Depot from a night merchandise stocker starts by getting there a half hour early for a mandatory meeting of what's arriving for the night off the delivery trucks and side project to complete. After that we clock in and go to our assign departments Pallets will be delivered to each department to be broke down and stocked. Once everything that can be stocked the overstock is put on empty pallets, wrapped and labeled. You use a forklift to be put away on top of the H-frames with labels facing out. Once all departments are stocked and organized we then clean the store for when its opens. What I learned from this job is OSHA standard polices is very important to follow for safety reasons. The hardest part of the job is when there is a big shipment of merchandise arrives all at once some nights and getting it stocked and wrapped before the shift is over. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing your night shift manager happy with your for a job well done."
good,"I personally felt as if I had a family with the Home Depot. I enjoyed the people I worked with, however, I felt as though it was lacking in motivation. I strive to be the best I can and to represent the values of The Home Depot, but, I feel sometimes that is not enough to make the management happy. The motivation is there in the sense of an appreciation for coworkers and customers alike, but, as far as managerial motivation and appreciation, it lacks. However, the managers are still good people and I still enjoy them."
good,the day can get busy but your coworkers always have your back. fun environment but when it gets busy people are stretched thin.
good,"I have worked in the Garden Department for 2 years, "
good,"Tiene muy buenas prestaciones, buenos horarios,y oportunidades de crecimiento laboral ."
good,company is about trying to advance the employees but with fun and encouragement via bonuses and party
good,"I have worked as a Cashier for awhile then I had moved onto a Head cashier for a bit,running a team of cashiers/lot personnel. Also had worked in the vault which carried a float of 30,000 dollars a day. Which then moved me to Customer Service/Returns. At the end of my career at Home Depot for about three years,I did return to vendor. So not only working as associate to serve the customer,I also had the opportunity to work with the vendor part of the store. The hardest part of the job was scheduling for a team of associates,part/full timers. I would have to say working with a lot of cultures would be the best part of the day."
good,Great environment and the work was worth the pay and hours. fair place to work and very friendly understanding management
good,"My typical day was spent maintaining a clean work space, ringing up purchases, and communicating with customers and coworkers. I learned how to multi-task more efficiently and how to have greater patience. The management strove to keep communication open with employees and tried to make sure everyone was updated if unplanned situations came up."
good,Typical retail store. Good values and great training program. Lots of room for advancement. Low pay compared to competition. Wide range of employees from retired to young and just starting out.
good,"home depot was a good work space, i learned to work at a fast pace. didnt like the customers there but overall i liked the job"
good,They are very flexible with the schedule. They offer good opportunities to grow within the company. The training is very good. The benefits are great and its not easy to find everywhere else.
good,"Great fast paced environment, excellent peers and customers, great products. Management was almost invisible. Mid management had a cadre of favorites and if you were not a part of it they treated you as sub human."
good,My day would mostly start with reviewing sales information and calculating dollar amounts which I had control of such as employee over time and markdown dollars used through out a week to date and Year to date basis. I then would plan out my day for my associates as well as myself to maximize the most productivity I can get while still performing customer service duties. At the Home Depot we've always carried a family atmosphere while being there for each other for work life and personal life situations weather negative or positive. What I've learned that is of most valuable to me is how to get the best out of my people working with the attributes that person may have. Doing this allows me to judge the work load or agenda that I would assign that person. Also challenging myself (holding myself accountable) to make sure that I am the top performer at my job as a role model for all that I supervise.
good,"I loved working for Home Depot. I had the wondrous experience of working in Alaska, and it was a unique experience."
good,"A usual day of work consists of a lot of customers throughout the day , so I am always busy and even if I don/t have a customer there is a lot to do. "
good,"I remember black friday sale of november 2015, the store was so busy that i could not just stay in my department as i usually do. By not staying in my department made the day very hard for me that day as i lack some knowledge in different products. I started shadowing my other co workers in different departments to start learing about different products and learn how to use some of their machines to assist customers when the store get too busy. The most enjoyable part about that day was learning to use the different machines because now i feel like i could im really versatile and my managers was really proud to see that"
good,Overall the schedule was good . You have paid holidays off. You also receive success share every six months. The workers are friendly. The only major issue with me would be the pay. But other then that it's a good job.
good,"Le Home Depot de Victoriaville est très flexible pour les étudiants. Il leur permet de soit travailler l'été, soit la fin de semaine seulement."
good,"A typical day at the workplace consist of heavy-duty traffic within the workplace. I learned how to operate many machinery devices at The Home Depot. Management and my co worker were the best, everyone was friendly and very supportive. The  most enjoyable part of my job was not always feeling like I was working, but helping work on many project that built everlasting relationships with customers and co workers."
good,"I enjoy working for this company and I like the fact that they offer benefits for part timers, promises growth throughout the organization if desired."
good,Home Depot is a great friendly work place to work with plenty of opportunity to work your way up.  They offer their employers great beneifts and even sick time
good,"Work as a cashier at Home Depot was enjoyable. I worked shifts from 4-8 hours long with main tasks of cleaning the register area, operating the register, and directing customers to products of their choice. Had I not known how to do these, there were initial instructions in order to teach one how to use the systems and item placement in the building. They have it all covered. Even if I forgot where something was, I could always ask another cashier who was ready and happy to help."
good,"It was an easy job but a lot of work, I learned how to operate multiple lift machines and deal with contractor relations. The management varied, some were better than others. The opportunity to grow within the company is a huge plus, I was promoted in just 6 months and received 2 raises in my first year."
good,At home depot the work atmosphere is pretty positive. If you can get  the work assigned to you done within a reasonable time then there are no problems. As long as you are willing to work hard then working for this company should be easy going.
good,"Home Depot is a great company, but unfortunately, the wages are not great. The environment in the store and on a daily basis is fun and rewarding, but can also be challenging. Customers can be downright mean at times. The management is very good about handling problems in an expeditious fashion however. "
good,Its more of a common sense work place. Very high on safety and very concerned for the employees. They took the time to get to know who you were. Coaches and management helped a lot when needed.
good,The home depot is a very rewarding and great place to work. They have awesome benefits and chances for advancement. Management  is always willing to help if you don't understand procedures and offers extra training if need be. The hardest part of my job as a head cashier was not having enough time to talk to the customers. The best part about my job was handling problems and helping my customers have the best shopping experience possible.
good,"My experience with home depot has been a good one. Reasonable management, friendly co workers and easy going environment. As long as u show up and show effort your guaranteed a long lasting career."
good,"Rent and receive tools rented by public."
good,Home depot was very profectional as far as the day when the people ok and was there for work .pay well and employees complained not much at all.
good,Great place to work! Every changing. Always something new to learn. Management overall can be better! There are so many facets to THD and its product and services.
good,I loved the environment.The people that worked there was great. It does get boring after a while so it was always exciting to get new projects to do.
good,"Honestly a pretty solid place to grow for a first ""real"" job out of college."
good,The Home Depot is an excellent company to work for and have a career. Its benefits are outstanding and the atmosphere is one of family
good,The customer always comes first at Home Depot. The associates are very professional and knowledgeable. On any given day I am fulfilling a customers needs. The management staff is very conscientious and supportive. They care very much about the associates as well as the customers. The hardest thing about working for Home Depot is that sometimes we are understaffed. I find being busy and solving problems is the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,"great company to work for. Easy to advance in the company with hard work. Company was there when you showed the drive to learn new things and also to train outside of your job field,"
good,"the work environment I work at is great, the people I work with are really friendly and we all have the common goal to help each customer that comes in the store."
good,I enjoy working with The Home Depot a great place to pursue ones objectives and achieve ones goals. It's open door policy is excellent.  A typical day at work can be classified one where all scheduled associate shows up to work No one knows everything. Almost every week I learn something new. Management is excellent they listen and solve your problem when possible. Co-workers always show a smiling face when at work. Unscheduled absences can be one of the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the trucks arrive on time and all scheduled associates are at work.
good,"A typical day at home depot, is to expect the unexpected. However, I love that about my daily job is that I can assist customers with any issue they are having in their life while trying to make the Home Depot the number one customer service retailer in the world. Therefore, the more hats one can wear the better because, one never knows what they are going to be doing in my position. Whether it is stocking shelves and making the store look grand opening ready. To selling a custom order for a customer while being out on the sales floor. Or helping and answering customer concerns when covering for the manager while in their absence. Expect the unexpected."
good,"I have been employed at the Carmichael Home Depot for almost 11 years. During that time I have learned several departments and increased my knowledge about home improvement as well as retail. I have established close relationships with my co-workers, management team, and customers. Unfortunately, two things have recently happened that forces me to look for employment else where. First, we moved so now my commute takes me about an hour one way. When you are working a four hour shift it really doesn't feel economical. Second, I feel there is no room for advancement. I recently applied for Head Cashier and almost three months later I sadly have not been interviewed for the position. It appears there is no room for advancement or opportunity to promote. I have cherished my time with this company but it's time for a change. I am looking forward to working with new people and taking on new challenges."
good,"fun place to work for with many challenges everyday, i would not mind going back to work for home depot, I am trying to get back on the team"
good,There are many opportunities to advance in this company. The work environment is friendly and the customers are good people.
good,"working with customers and co-workers how ever retail hours can be difficult.  Staff are easy ti work with,,,,call me in for interview ans we can chat"
good,Fat pace caller with great management staff. numbers are very important . And also attention to detail. The best part of the job is resolving customers issues to their satisfaction . Support from colleagues is a great help.
good,"Fast place workplace where production is high but remains fun. Managers are engaged, employees are valued. They supplied, game rooms, pool table tailgating, contest and prize give-aways."
good,"everyones friendly full of joy."
good,"Empresa dedicada al servicio al cliente, con buenos estandares en capacitacion a sus aosciados, oportunidades de crecimiento y mejora de calidad de vida"
good,always something to learn and do the employees there are all very knowledgeable and have great attitudes and the customers are just a delight I was always in a good mood and the management staff are excellent
good,"Walk the store and have it 100% ready ,instock 100% and every associate with apron and ready to give there best in customer service.If you work with your people and you take care of them they will give you back there best and 100% in there work.Leave and work by EXAMPLE.The hardest part of work is when you are far away from your family and work many hours .When people use your store as a example of the best store"
good,"My co-workers were very welcoming. The customers were always considerate to the employees. I learned a great deal about products that I use nearly everyday, which made it easier to discuss issues and situations with customers when they had questions or concerns. The hardest part of my job was the use of equipment that took me off my feet, considering I'm nervous about falling. The most enjoyable part of my job was servicing customers and making sure they left satisfied."
good,"I only worked at home depot part time but int he time i was there,i met cool people and learned a lot about home improvement."
good,Home Depot offers a fast paced culture where you are your only impediment to further advancement.  Promotions are merit based and can come quickly.
good,"The customers are wonderful!  Over the past two years I've been promoted , and have been enjoying learning all of the contractors' names and about the work that they do.The people I work with are pretty amazing as well.  I find it very easy to work as a team with the majority of my co-workers and all of my MOD's.  While the benefits are wonderful (Health care, vision, dental, 401k), Wages are not enough to live on despite a 40 hour work week.  Management is great though, and THE HOMER FUND is a wonderful part of the culture there.  It is a charity that helps employees across the nation when they are on hard times, such as fires, etc...Volunteer opportunities are always being presented to us also."
good,Excellent place to work. Well diverse and the environment is rich with friendly associates. Treat customers as family and put them first.
good,Multi culture work environment.There we can learn and grow well. Have good respect and response always.Very good compensation with attitude.
good,"This is definitely one of the most challenging jobs mentally and sometimes physically depending on your department. I liked the job because you learn so much about home improvement and meet so many great people - customers and co-workers. If you take the job seriously you can take a lot from it. Before I worked here I was a bit shy when it came to holding conversation with new people. After a month or so on the sales floor conversation became natural. "
good,"Go to my cash register and ring up customers, help direct cutomers to correct areas of the store, and keep my work space clean and stocked. I learned there point of sale system. manager was nice, as well as coworkers. Hardest part was standing still most of the time. the most enjoyable was working with people."
good,Professional work place and plenty of fun. Most days are unpredictable because you never know who is going to walk through the doors.
good,"Es una empresa la cual tiene un excelente ambiente de trabajo, el personal es amable, los superiores tambien lo son."
good,"Most of the time you are very busy, but there is a little down time. There is always something to do. I enjoy working at Home Depot because everyone is friendly and I love helping the customers. Supervisors make sure you get breaks and lunch."
good,"Supportive management team"
good,"Home depot is one of the best places I have worked, and have a long number of awesome employee's. Also you chance's to advance within the company is decent too."
good,I would clean residents room and talk to them and organized their room I would have conversation with the residents and I would get attached and they will always come and look for me. I felt like I had a reason to go to work ...
good,given reasonability and freedom to grow and learn with the company given excellent customer service skills and functional abilities
good,"I would clock in and go to my desk and look to see if any customers needed to be called.  I would call customers to let them know if their product was in or if their measurement for either flooring or blinds was back.  I would work up the quote and then call them with the total and see if I could get the customer to close on the sale.  If needed I would have the customer come in so we could go over the quote face to face to answer any questions they might have.  There were many things I learned at Home Depot.  My co-workers were wonderful and if they had any questions they would come to me and I would help them with the question, whether it was for a customer or just so they would know the correct way to answer the question for a customer in the future.  The best part of the day was seeing all the different customers come in and know that I was able to help them with their problems.  Then only bad thing about the job is sometimes the scheduling would be bad and have just one person open in the morning, one in the afternoon and one to close.  That made it hard to make sure that all customers got the full attention that they needed.  Most customer were willing to wait but some would walk away seeing that they had a few customers in front of them and they couldn't or wouldn't wait as long as I needed them to, to be able to take care of every customer to the fullest the way that they needed to be."
good,"Great company, great benefits. Hours and promotions are not great or fair. It is a great learning experience if you are in a department you not only learn your product you learn how to get things done with your products."
good,LOved working here great atmosphere loving people always work to keep busy positive vibe where everyone works together
good,Everyone is very friendly and there was always some kind of celebration going on.  You even shared in the profit sharing. Customers were mostly friendly. Your work shift would change weekly.
good,when I would open the store and close the store. deal with cash handling. making plans for the team to be able to be cohesive in the company and also making sure everyone was assisting customers the best of their abilities
good,An awesome place to work and it was a great experience.  The company overall is a great place to work.  I would recommend it to anyone to try it as a career.
good,Good place to gain customer service experience and be recognized for going above and beyond in the workplace. The breaks are relatively short and employees are required to take lunches before 6 hours into their shift.  It is a fun and rewarding place to work.
good,"Working for the Home Depot has taught everything I know today. I have learned so much about how to give great customer service. Everyone that I work with is so friendly, and helpful."
good,"My typical day is all about teaching, coaching and training other associates throughout the store.  As an Asm we look at how we are trending for the year and how we can improve our numbers as well."
good,"On a regular day at Amazon I would warm-up my forklift machine and load up all the freight onto the trucks. I learned how to be fast but productive and safe as well.The management was excellent, and my co-workers were very helpful for me. I had no difficulties on this job, but the most enjoyable was operating the forklift safely."
good,"My history of working out on jobs, I learned more of inventory, commercial work, sales, and shipping on a regular day. Management is sometimes good and bad. Co- workers has been great, and not so great."
good,Home Depot is a phenomenal organization to work for.  They promote teamwork and promotion of their staff.  They truly put their customers first and focuses on how to better serve the customer.  Fast paced environment but it's worth it for the benefits.
good,"I enjoy working with all my co-workers. I do sometimes have a hard time when we are understaffed to find someone to help me get a price on a item that does not have a bar code on it, to keep customer from waiting."
good,"I learned many of my management skills through HomeDepot. "
good,I loved working in the Garden Center. I sold everything from plants to mowers and when I wanted a workout I could just go help load up 100+ bricks into some old guys cart/car. There were good benefits and I heard about chances for upward movement but I wasn't there long enough to experience it. The pay is much better than regular retail and the job teaches you about good customer service and rewards it as well. The only thing that bothered me from time to time were my particular managers that seemed to want to crunch the numbers just that much harder even if you're giving your all.
good,"a typical day at work usually went as planned, show up, stock freight, and overhead the overstock. I learned How to efficiently manage what little time we had to stock freight when the management took 2 hours to get it all onto the floor."
good,"Great atmosphere, everyone was always smiling and said hi, no animosity, had a comfortable place for employees to relax on breaks/lunches, ping pong table, tv, food stations, and they were always doing things for there employees. Work was relaxed they played music, always on the floor walking around seeing if you need help, handed out prizes for great customer service, the work days flowed fast daily."
good,"It's a great company to work for, I loved it there. It's just the company doesn't pay well. Even the management positions have low pay scales"
good,a typical day at work i went in at 8 o clockand ddnt leave til twelve that night maybe a lil later depends if eric and the crew where still busy i would stop what i was during from eight to ten so i could assist customers if they needed help finding something or anything at all the hardest part was getting everything done around the customers but after ten my job went really fast paced casuse i didnt have to worry about them and could focus on the tasks ihad to do the best tims where lunch when we had our break talking to everyone and getting to know some of the people that worked their better they where all real friendly and i could always ask them for help and they did help me and i would always help them if they needed any theirselves
good,"Positive work environment, updates on company products with on-site training, excellent benefits and company rewards. Provided excellent customer services, completed daily tasks, maintained excellent store appearance and operated forklift, reach, and OP."
good,Very good company to work for; structured well and comfortable co-workers.  Perfect for someone looking to move up in a company.
good,Store is kept busy most of the time. There is always something that can be done to keep busy.  Great associates to work with.
good,Enjoyable place to work lots of room for advancement. Cashier position a little boring but if you advance to work the sales floor your day is filled with things to do and your day fly's by.
good,"Every day, customers would come in to home depot looking to finish their projects and always coming in with questions. This is great because its not only a learning experience for the customer but for me as well and it makes working for home depot more enjoyable."
good,"My day starts out managing and training cashier, preparing for the need of the customer. Problem solving, addressing customer needs and delivering excellent customer service. I learned to be patience with the employees and customer. Always keeping a positive attitude regardless of the situation or behavior of others. The managers within the company was totally focus on sales and customer service. Some held higher standard then others, but we all was focus when it came to profit and loss. My co-worker was fun and interesting. The hardest part about this position was getting the employee more involved. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customer, follow-up calls, making sure any customer with an complaint that the matter was solve within minute."
good,"- lots of engagement and feedback from employees."
good,Great Company to work for. They truly respect and take care of their employees. The company is innovative and urges employees to considered career growth.
good,I would pallet build by receiving product down a conveyor belt and taking that product and placing it on 1 of 6 store location pallets. Then when the pallet was full I would close the pallet out pull it back and open a new pallet. I learned how to build a stable and accurate pallet. I got along with management and made a  lot of friends with the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was when i worked in fluid loading in a hot trailer in the summer. The most enjoyable part of the job is that they always came up with new incentives and feed us at least once a month sometimes more.
good,"I enjoy customer interaction with being able to help and solve their problems. Team members are willing to help and work with you to achieve a common goal. In store training is well balanced and available. Sometimes Home Depot doesn't carry the brand or the item a customer wants and that can irritate a customer, and there is  not a whole lot you can do to assist them than to give them a location where they can find that product. The upper management at my current location is reasonable and accommodating to all of their associate needs, and they are warm and approachable."
good,"A typical day at work is assisting customers in resolving home improvement efforts, helping them in the selections of products and services that meet their personal needs.  No two days, or customer needs are the same. I am constantly learning something new, whether it is another aspect of Home Depot's technological system,  a resource to help resolve a customer's need, or what goes on in another department, there is always something new to learn. I have an amazing management team, they show appreciation for my contribution, they are willing to teach those things that are necessary to move up in the store/company, they are extremely supportive. I am among a team of co-workers that are team players and willing to share knoweledge. The most difficult part of my job is being on my feet the entire time while I'm at work, certain aspects of the job requires certifications/operations of heavy equipment; this can pose a problem when a customer need a product that is located overhead and no one is available to help with meeting that need of the customer due to lack of certification to retreive the desired merchandise.I enjoy helping people as a whole, because I stay as busy as I do, my day goes by very fast."
good,"I enjoy working on MET for The Home Depot. The early hours work well with my school schedule. I enjoy the hands on work when completing projects. There is a lot of monotonous work when it comes to general service. Our team is small but this makes us close. You can leave work with a sense of accomplishment but there are times you come back to work and wonder if you had even done anything the previous day. The pay could be a bit more but I'm sure everyone can say that about their job."
good,"Typical day at Home Depot you'l clock in, put your apron on and go to you department and start working on your task of the day."
good,"I've been with Home Depot for a year. Seems like there is scheduling issues where we have tons of associates one day and not enough, if any, in each department another day. Sometimes you are asked to do a task that you have had no training or experience in and management never seems aware of what you are trained on and it is even more difficult to get help when you are stuck on an issue with a customer. There is opportunity to advance there though if you are willing to keep trying to learn more. You do get more put downs than you do praise in this company."
good,"-Unload merchandise."
good,"The shift I worked ran 4:45a through 3:30pm. Quite the early bird, but definitely fast-paced and full of high energy. Great teamwork and also I should mention climate-controlled warehouse environment."
good,"Buena empresa para laborar"
good,I really like working for Home Depot. The management team is awesome and I like the fact that they really get involved with associate events and give out great prizes on a monthly basis. There are chances for advancement but only if you know the right the people.
good,"My mornings start like this at home depot, employees clock then we have to walk our department for safety (making sure no merchandise are leaning off shelve) then isle has to be clear so the customer don't get hurt. After that is done then there something we do called pack down(going from aisle to aisle to see what can be put on the shelve) you do that till about 10am cause after 10 am its power hour with is till 2pm (seek out customer) between 10am-2pm are the most critical times of the day. My co-workers are good employees to work, we always help each other."
good,Good over all life-work balance. Lots of good people in the store. Salary was low and it takes quite a while to advance within the company.
good,"Making sure that all of the carts are returned neatly, helping others load their purchases into the vehicles, sweep all walk ways, take out the trash."
good,working with good hard working people is what really drives this place. you learn many things while working there. good luck getting weekends off.
good,"My job consists of completing daily tasks such as keeping aisles maintained, product stocked, and shelves clean. All while quickly, friendly, and effectively meeting the needs of customers and management. Throughout my time with Home Depot I have learned a large variety of skills such as how to correctly execute home improvement projects, much about many different products, and the marketing aspects of retail. The hardest part would be the low associate to customer ratio. My favorite part being able to help people with their projects."
good,I highly recommend working for Home Depot.   A typical day at work would be dealing with many people and I love working with people.  My co-workers are great people to work with and very helpful.
good,Home Depot allow you to work a schedule that allow to future your education and its a great place to learn home improvement.... I enjoy working at the Home Depot and continue to finish my education.
good,"En un día laboral.... se ejecutan sin fin de tareas tanto administrativas como operarias pero principalmente es la atención al cliente y eso hace del trabajo el que sea mas dinámico,                                          "
good,"Working at The Home Depot, has built my professional skills in customer service. I also gained a new trade with in solving solutions for home owners and renters. My future goal is to become a nurse. I appreciate how it is a fast pace work place, due to the responsibilities I will one day take on."
good,The work done is primarily busy work with occasional breaks whether it be assisting customers or a scheduled break. The coworkers are friendly and helpful.
good,"on a typical day at home depot i would clock in and go right out to the sales floor, and engage with customers to help provide the ones that needed help with great customer service, there i learned a lot about hardware tools, and how to make keys for cars and houses, and i was also taught the key guidelines to becoming a great customer service professional, management at home depot was awesome making sure we all had a great work environment and seeing that we got training in any field available, the hardest part of this job was learning where everything in the building was but it comes with time, the most enjoyable part was interacting  with customers, and providing great customer service."
good,"es buen hambiente , solo que aveces cuando si ocupabas vacaciones no te la autorizaban nadamas por que no , todo lo demas esta bien solo era eso ."
good,"My typical day @ work is very busy, attending to the needs of customers. Customer service is a top priority for the company and it is emphasized throughout the day.My responsibility as a flooring, kitchen, and call center associate are not limited to only those departments. I am trained and certified to handle issues in other departments as well. i have had extensive amounts of training for the products we carry as well as special ordering, installation, delivery and rental equipment. There are many aspects of my position which can  be previewed as a management position if the manager is not available. The most entertaining part of the job is working with co workers and customers. Everybody becomes a part of the team."

Making sure all the customers on the call list are called. Then checking for out of stocks. Packing down any out of stocks that were found. Straightening any and all shelves. Next I would check the no home report.  This is a list of items in inventory but not on a shelf.  I would locate them in the overhead and find a home for them on the shelf. I would check on incoming PO's to see if they were on time or late. If they were late I would call to find out why they had not been shipped. Just before leaving I would leave a note so the next associate new where I had finished.  I left daily notes in the order system on any and all phone calls made to customers , manufacturers , trucking companies, or other employees. "
good,"This was a position that helped me build confidence as a women. This was a position that when I first started was hard to feel like I belonged. I worked in the appliance, hardware, paint, and sometimes the plumbing area. Many times contractors would come in and either walk right past me to the male employees or specifically ask for a male employee. It took time and confidence to win the trust of these contractors and soon they were feeling like I was just as experienced as any other employee in the departments. I could work in any department with confidence and answer questions about most products available to the employees."

good,"I enjoyed people as they came to work on their projects, learning from other associates and sharing each others knowledge. The extreme temperatures in the garden were the hardest  part of the job, but I wouldn't trade the experience for the world! I loved spring and fall the best, I always have though.

good,"I've enjoyed working at The Home Depot, particularly the work culture."
good,A great job that had its moments where it could be stressful. The most stressful thing aboutthe job was not having enough people work different areas in the store.

good,overall i love working with the people i've worked with while working for  home depot and i loved hoe management treated us. its an overall welcoming and family oriented place to work.
good,"As a supervisor majority of my days are spent making sure that I am fully in stock, which involves placing orders and speaking with my vendors or sales representatives. We focus on three principles; customer service, in-stock, and store appearance. Once I'm sure that my two departments are in-stock for my customers to shop, my associates and I spend our time with the customers doing what we can to ensure that they have an enjoyable shopping experience with us. A part of ensuring the customer has a good shopping experience is to make sure the departments are clean, shoppable, and safe."
good,"Love working for The Home Depot, due to the excellent associates I was associated with, due to the great development of the training."
good,"A typical day at work at The Home Depot would start with getting the paint machines ready, walking the aisles and doing a safety check list, and checking to see what holes needed to be filled. The management was great. Working at The Home Depot was like working with a big family. Management was very attentive to the needs of their employees, and co-workers were great too! The hardest part of the job would have been when the paint desk was backed up and you didn't have any help. Things can get somewhat chaotic."
good,"The people were great. The work was variable. I loved the fact that I was always busy; always on the move. The customers were good, for the most part. I was never bored. I learned all kinds of things about home maintenance and home beautification. Management seemed to really care about the people working under them."
good,"I would greet customers, assist customers, check customers out, check on orders, call venders, answer the phone and spot for other employees using heavy equipment. I learn so much I can't even begin to cover it. The management was always there for you when you had a question or to just guide you. All of the co workers are amazing to work with. The hardest part of the job was making all the customers happy but, their smile and thanks makes it all worth it."
good,"I have learned several things about home improvement and have excelled in several different departments. A general day at work for me consists of scanning products to be sure it is ordered and available for customers. Scanning outs, packing down product to the shelf. Helping customers with questions and qualifying them with the right questions to be sure they get exactly what they need to complete their various projects. Dispensing paint, maintaining the paint machinery and ensuring my associates know they are respected and appreciated so they do the best job they can. The best part of my job is working with customers, learning about what they are doing and getting to know each person individually. I also enjoy managing my associates, letting them know they are appreciated, teaching them and helping them grow in their careers.

good,"Overall The Home Depot is good company to work for. The company gives back to the community, its employees and offers many opportunities for career growth as well as flexibility. In-store management has gotten better through time and is still showing improvement. Training methods are up to date with technology. Each stores environment is different depending on the location, the people/ employees and the attitude the management sets forward for their employees and store."
good,"The store has so many departments and associates, its unbelievable that we all know each other. Everyone is dedicated to their job and always try to give the best costumer service to our guest."
good,"a typical day at work is greeting customers helping them fined products and explain how it works or what they should do,management is always making sure you are OK and everything is up to date.hardest part is going home after a long day of work."
good,I loved working for Home Depot the co-workers are very nice and friendly and so are the managers. I love working with the public I get to meet different types of people and learning new things.
good,"Was a very good company to work for up to the last couple of years and they made changes to become a very ""corporate"" with some SOPs. The company has taken away some of the individuality that existed before. Still a good place for younger people to start their career, lots of opportunities."
good,"aprendes a trabajar en equipo"
good,AWESOME!!! Not many companies like it. Great place to have a career.
good,Constantly switching from one task to the next. Learned to manage up to 40 people at one time and complete tasks.
good,I enjoyed working for Home Depot. I wanted to stay. The pay was great and a positive working place. I only left because of schedule conflict.
good,Started in Hardware and trained a few employees at opening because I worked at Builders Square for 6 1/2 years before coming to Home Depot. I assisted in the tool corral as cashier and stocked the area daily. I made keys for customers and helped them find the products they needed for the job they were doing.
good,"Being a part of the Home Depot team is very exciting because of the many opportunities of learning new things everyday from associates and customers. There is constantly things to do such as stocking, merchandising, and maintenance. With the tendency of being shy from the past, the Home Depot taught me how to communicate well from providing customer service. Everybody is always available to help one another. One of the tough parts of the job is being unable to help everyone that needs it in one day's work. Overall, working in the Home Depot is an enjoyable work environment because of the associates and experiences gained that come along with it."
good,I worked at night after the store closed which made the work environment safer for the employees and customers.
good,"THE HOME DEPOT is a great company with great benefits."
good,Everyday was a different day although with basic duties. Co-workers were great and management was supportive
good,"Very good team work ethic. Excellent managers, I don't have anything negative to say."
good,Delivered quality customer service in handling customer inquiries. Collaborated with team members to enhance customer experience. Developed strong time management skills while working under pressure.
good,"-It is a great company to work for.  "
good,"A typical day at work consists of answering phones, making returns for the customers, creating and maintaining special orders, and calling vendors and the credit center if needed.  I also fill in as a head cashier when I'm needed.  I usually will ring customers up, answer any question a customer/cashier has, and manage breaks for the cashiers.  When I am a head cashier I have to be available to everyone at any given moment.  "
good,Team members were fun and energetic and were dedicated to their job and the company.  Longevity was the theme.  There were plenty of opportunities for advancement and opportunities for rewards.
good,"• My work day consists of working with the store and vendors to make sure products and displays are placed just right to make an award winning shopping experience for the customer."
good,"I was hired by The Home Depot 4 years ago and am still employed by them.  "
good,Walk the floors to check and see if the stock on the shelves needs to be replenished. It was a good tool for learning more about different everyday household products and the science behind them. working with different people everyday really developed my social skills and how to motivate my team to be the best sales associates possible. The hardest thing about that particular job is when it's inventory time and we have to go down every station and count pieces one by one. I enjoyed talking with people explaining the product of interest to meet their standards plus make their day .
good,"There's always something new to discover! There will always be a new problem to solve. I learned just about everything on how to fix up your home. Management is always supportive, and looks out for the employees and customers. It's a large company, bu it has family values. Associates are always taking care of one another. The hardest part of the job are the hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning something new every single day."
good,"Good place to work during school. Very fast paced and flexible work environment. In this position it was never mundane, always fresh and exciting. "
good,The Home Depot was a really big store. It was so big you barely knew the people that worked with you. The environment was really fast-paced all the time. People would come up to you left and right asking questions about certain products. That's not even the hard part. The hardest part was learning the store.
good,"in a typical work day i merchandise new products, build product displays such as light fixtures and ceiling fans.I also help customers find what they need in the aisles. the most enjoyable part of the job is the building of the displays and helping the customers but that's also the hardest part, but i enjoy doing them both. the management is great. they're always offering helpful suggestions on how we can increase sales or customer satisfaction."
good,"Keep one's station neat and orderly while waiting for a customers.  Quickly checkout customers, provide feedback to management and take reviews, and provide the last line of theft awareness. Management is caring, hard working, and supportive.  The hardest part of the job is not having any customers to help. The most enjoyable part is being able to help customers fulfill their shopping needs."
good,"I loved working with the overnight stocking crew at Home Depot. Everyone was always willing to help each other out to get the job done, in the best way we could. Management was always very understanding."
good,"For me a typical day at work includes coming in and viewing pending quotes in the department, contacting customers, contacting vendors and fixing orders. I have learned product knowledge throughout the store, ranging from garden to lumber, and knowledge on how to work the computer systems and store's machinery. Management is great at my store, easy to talk to, and always willing to help, especially when it comes to moving up in the company. Co-workers are the best part and are what keep me sane at times. While there are moments where I have 10 different things going at once, the other associates are what keep me calm since we all have those moments to share. The hardest part of the job is being the person responsible for fixing orders and ensuring accuracy since the others in the department are fairly new still. At the same time it is enjoyable since it does get recognized and provides chances to move up in the company."
good,"Work can always be a drag at some time. But it's all about making fun times happen, which is the group I work with."
good,"As long as you keep your head down and just do your job, it's all good. When I first started, you could stand up and shine. Now the local stores are overrun with employees who like to squash the hard-workers to keep themselves from looking bad. It's not like that at all the stores, though. Just Burlington and Bellingham. The company has it all right and knows how to treat their people. You have a lot of advancement opportunities, benefits, success-sharing, etc. Overall, a fabulous company to work for!"
good,"Working hard, concentrate with job design."
good,"This is a great company to work for if you're seeking job advancement. The company believes in promoting from within, which gives employees a great opportunity to gain management experience."
good,Great place to work were everyone treats you like family. I have learned a lot about merchandising and different aspects of the business.  I enjoy coming to work and working with my fellow associates.
good,"very busy practice"
good,"Typical day isn't typical. Variety is most enjoyable."
good,As my job duties as an associate were quite varied. The main part of the job was to set product displays to a set of computer diagrams. This work often required computer search and use of systems to correct existing data.
good,Working here is a great place to learn all kinds of new skills. There is always room for advancement here and if you can get full time its a great place to work. I worked well with everyone there and enjoyed it very much. Sometimes when you work at a job with multiple managers it could be hard because you don't know which one to listen to and you cant make all of them happy. There are a lot of skills that i have developed here at home depot before i quit. If you are at entry level you will be either cashiering of lifting heavy product/ lumber.
good,"Each day is vastly different, from seasonal resets to weekly projects, to daily maintenance of product bays.  A great experience through and through but most of the company is moving from Full to Part time.  Pay is great for the work and the environment is awesome."
good,"A typical day for me often consists of maintaining a store environment that is a pleasant experience for customers by managing many employees simultaneously. Work begins fairly early in the morning, often before the retail location opens from 6am to 10pm hour workday begins. As a Retail manager I  handle a wide variety of routine tasks, such as writing reports; supervising employees; managing cash; ordering stock; handling schedules, payroll, and marketing and promotional roll-outs; and securing the store upon closing. In addition, a retail manager can expect to deal with customer complaints, employee work delegation, staff shortages, equipment failures and other unexpected things that occur in a retail environment. On average, retail managers may work as many as 50 or more hours per week."
good,A nice place to work for part-time or if you are a student as a cashier or freight associate.
good,"I spend a lot of time with computers and phones. There is a lot of making sure between the vendors and customers all the orders are all set and ready to go. I have learned a great deal with computers, phone etiquette, leading a team, and interpersonal skills. I keep lines of communication not only with my salaried managers but also with my own team of associates."
good,"Great Company to help build your resume"
good,I worked there for so Long they were Like a Family to me. I Love working with the public. I get along very well with others
good,"A typical day at work is fairly simple, great family-esque place. All my associates became friends quite quickly. Always had to deal with management, no one really liked the management. I learned great customer service skills through the corporate training provided. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the management of the store. The most enjoyable part was dealing with customers, as long as you were nice to them they were usually nice to you."
good,"customer service, problem solving, down stocking, pack out on the freight team Merchandising. I was able to fix plumbing problems for customers and how to better understand people. in thier problems and to solve them  I had a Great Management Team My co workers and I learned from eachother to better the store and Customers Teamwork  I love being part of the team! Hardest part of the job would be the hours scheduled. The most enjoyable part is The Gratitude  of the customers when a problem is solved"
good,"What I usually do at The Home Depot can range from keeping the building in order, to performing retail in many different departments of the store. Since my hiring I have learned product knowledge in the electrical, seasonal and paint departments as well as being trained on cash registers. The co-workers are very supportive and friendly to each other during the day especially when something at work gets frustrating for someone. The management is well structured and very effective, the department supervisors are very helpful when they introduce me to a new department that they want me to work in by giving me the proper preparation and knowledge.  The hardest part of the job is keeping my composure and focus when I am getting overwhelmed with customers and trying to keep them all happy as we have a ""customers first"" mentality.  The most enjoyable part of the day is the compliments I get from customers and the short conversations I have with them after I serve them."
good,"Was great experience, got to learn about a real job, was my first job experience, loved using the fork lift and reach truck"
good,"The great thing about The Home Depot is that the harder you work the farther you'll go. I started out as a part time lot associate pushing carts and loading cars. I put in a lot of work and energy and it paid off. I was moved inside to lumber and building materials. From there I continued to put a lot of effort into my job. I was always chosen to to do the work no one else wanted to do (overnights) and it paid off again. I was given full time status and continued to work diligently. I was made a team leader of an overnight staff and then an order puller until I was offered a supervisor position. I have only been with the company for 2 and a half years but they have really put forth a lot of time and energy into developing me as a crucial part of their team. My coworkers are awesome to work with and management is easy to approach. The only major drawback is that this is a retail job, and there is an inherent problem with retail. But as long as you go above and beyond to help customers, it's usually not that bad of a gig. Customers can be rude, and that's to be expected, but if you show them positive energy, they buy in to it pretty quick. I have learned a lot from working here, and they are all skills to be used in my personal or professional life. Like in everything, you only get out what you put in."
good,"Great working environment, great opportunity to climb the latter in rank and pay great managers great coworkers there is always something to keep you busy so your day goes by quickly"
good,Customer Care department is a fun and productive enviroment. It does consume alot of your time. There's not really a hard part about the position because if you have natural customer service talent then it will be a peice of cake for you.
good,"the shift always started with punching in, next if you were on the opening shift you would have to complete a check list of duties to complete before the store opening. during the days you would have to  help a lot on clients with different locations of items and move items from the store to there vehicles and getting them into said vehicles. the most enjoyable about the job was helping the customers with there heavy items. in total a great atmosphere all around in the store."
good,"I was a night stocker for Home Depot. My day actually started at night at around 11:00 p.m. in the evening and would last until open the next morning. I learned how restock items for next day sales in a very productive and very quick manner. My co-workers were very helpful assisting me when I fell behind. My management team was also very helpful assisting me when needed. The hardest part of this job was working during sleeping hours but I also learned how much I appreciated that kind of environment, quiet and completely to my self."
good,At the home depot I learned a lot. Not only in one department but in many others. I was able to expand my knowledge by doing a lot of hands on work which helped me gain not only knowledge but more experience in other departments.
good,I work with a diverse group of people and the environment is friendly.
good,"Home Depot is an outstanding company.  Expected to work hard, however the benefits of acquiring skills and knowledge make it fun.  The people, including supervisors and management have excellent training and aren't afraid to get their hands dirty rather than simply delegate tasks completely.  However, full-time positions and quick advancement are hard to reach.  Once in a new position, one must be in that position for 6 months at least until one can be placed in another.  Also, Home Depot at one time offered excellent health benefits to even part time employees, however the Affordable Care Act made this nearly impossible, thus also limiting the number of full-time positions."
good,"I got the chance to work with good people and got the chance to work in different departments. I have been with the company for almost 4 years. I have worked from cashier, freight team (working the graveyard shift), pack down, paint department and pro desk. I got to assist my managers and got to do certain projects that made me stand out. I love when I came to work, I knew some of the customers that came in regular and they always knew how get me to smile and laugh. It made my day. I learned how to take on my challenges and wanted to move up on management."
good,good place to work if you need a part time job. everyone is nice. the management is good.
good,"I love working here, mainly because of the ability to interact with people. I have great co-workers and great managers. I just wish I had 40 hours, we got paid more and could move up faster. I greet and assist people everyday, and it makes my day! I learned a lot about hand-tools, any lawn equipment, lights, and flooring."
good,"Overall, a really fun place to work, Great people and workers."
good,"The Home Depot has been my 'angel', taking care of my job there with loyalty and support."
good,A great part time job to have. Management is very understanding and easy going.
good,My typical day is filled with customers and employees both with whom I enjoy time and exchange options and knowledge of products and various experiences with.
good,Management team was very fun.  Many things to learn.  Responsibility is a huge part of the job with the many duties that need to be done.  Very strict corporate so many hours were put in.
good,Started at 18 and loved coming to work. It was always fun! As a cashier the registers were updated with the best technology and made things easy. Never had to worry of an angry customer waiting too long because Home Depot had back up cashiers who had to report asap! Home Depot knew what they were doing and never gave the customer what they wanted :just because they asked:.
good,"The home depot has a lot of benefits and a good place to work. my typical day at work would be a pleasant day break the freight with my associates then we move on to stocking the freight and last all the left over freight needs to go on top of the overhead. I've learn a lot of things of how to do it your self like unclogging your toilet, painting my home, how to install tile, and some general a/c maintenance. These are just a few of the things that i have learned in my experience at working at the home depot."
good,My family worked there as well and we worked over nights when the store was closed so we had it to ourself so there was alot of joke played one everone done by all managers in all
good,"Great place to work, it has its ups and downs but overall its a good job"
good,"You learn a lot of things in home depot. Their benefits are really awesome, and so is the job security. Full time and part time have medical, dental, life insurance, travel discounts, auto insurance, a pregnancy program for women, help for when a family is in need, and 401K. The work is not so busy. when Nov-Dec comes its very busy, but most of the time unless its a weekend or big holiday its slow. The culture in home depot is completely diverse, whites, hispanics, blacks, asians in most cases here in Miami FL its normal and not really a problem. Management sucks like most places, your manager needs to like you for you to advance in your position there. There is favoritism and my managers were very unfair to me. Don't be fooled, Home Depot does take money, they were charging me short term life disability, and VOL life just as i am employed there."
good,"I work 6am to 2:30pm so the hours are perfect for my lifestyle. I have two departments that I am captain of, and I take care of all the merchandising needs such as ordering displays or fixing them, all the signage, stocking, organizing, presentation of vender needs and expectations. "
good,it is a good place to work to make good money to provide for you or your family
good,"-Home depot supply chain"
good,"Order picking and making sure the right product made it to the correct location so stores have the merchandise. Management made sure you knew how to work RF scanners and where locations are if you don't know, the training the management gave helped a lot. Co-workers were nice and made sure your job was done correctly and helped if they could."
good,good place to work not just a job but a career if u decide to take it that far family style workers got the chance to really learn as I worked their
good,"started at 5AM worked to 2PM working in receiving, operated all equipment. last seven months worked 1PM to 10PM both shifts required overtime the past 3 years because of downsize of personnel in receiving from seven to three personnel. Working with the personnel was great but management I felt was weak. The work load in receiving became hard when they went to the RDC you had to break down the pallets to get ready to go to the floor and with one person it was a challange for you would receive two full trucks a night during the day and evening you had other LTL coming in also. What made enjoyable was the challange in getting the work done. I felt it was time to leave because of how the manning was done."

good,"It's a great place to work at if you have some knowledge of home improvement. Although, one learns very quick from the web training they provided and by asking your fellow associates for help. The only bad thing about working at the The Home Depot is that there is not set schedule. However, they are very good at working with your schedule if for example you are going to school. Scheduling a time off is also very easy and no hassle."

Management is awesome and friendly, energetic and very hard working. My coworkers are a lot of fun to work with, we all get along with each other and talk to each other, like I mention before it's like a big family.

I've learned how to communicate with customers in high pressured situations. The management at my store is friendly and easy to communicate with. My co-workers are always a pleasure to work with, we make it a fun and enjoyable environment to work in. I'd say the hardest part of my job is having an upset customer but I always take time to listen to their issue and resolve to the best of my ability. The best part of my job is knowing that I've helped a customer by finding what they need for a project and also assisting cashiers with any issues that may occur."

Usually I see the same people at work each week so everyone is comfortable and social at work. The things I've learned is how target inventory is important and that markdowns and markup do effect the organization. I also have become extremely comfortable operating machines such as the fork-lift and especially the reach truck. Shadowing my supervisor for the last couple of years I have gained a sense of empowerment which feeds my autonomy at work. I'm level headed and open minded and have enjoyed my time at the Home Depot.

After responding to emails an/or printing out some vital information obtained from emails for my associates i visit my store's ticketing system. There i'm able to review any notes to get up to speed with what happened over the weekend and begin to fix any customer issues. My first staff meeting is an hour after i clock in and it lasts for 1 to 2 hours depending on what information needs to be covered. After the meeting i verify any orders that are going out for delivery that day, and sign out the orders after they're loaded on the truck. I then file all paperwork from transfers, deliveries and pick-ups and key rec them into the store systems. Next i get back on the computer and look over the stores orders to make sure everything is running as seamless as possible. After lunch, its time for my operations meeting where we discuss suspicious activity going on throughout the store and come up with game plans to prevent theft. About halfway through my second meeting i have to get on my district conference call to communicate with all the other pro account managers in the district. On this call we ask and answer questions other managers might have. After this call i enter another meeting which last about 45 minutes.

good,"At the Home Depot I learned the value of customer service. At THD I created many relationships with customers that I still converse with to this day. As a team, THD teaches you to work together as a unit to ensure the complete satisfaction of each and every customer. As a cashier I was one of the last employees that the customers came in contact with, so we made sure to make a good and lasting impression so that the customers would want to come back to the store. The hardest part about the job would be some of the customers. Often some of the customers did not agree with a female working in certain areas of the store, but this made me work harder and also made these customers the most enjoyable part of the job. After seeing the amazement on a customer who was not sure if you could complete the task and having a customer then give you a compliment and say they would return because of the service provided by you made the job worth the time. I will always remember my time spent at THD."

On the down side though, the whole call center department was started as a trial basis and due to a few oversights in pre-determining bad weather conditions that led to call offs and the fact that many of the medical facilities were using their own on-call staff to fill positions immediately after placing a call to our department... the call center was closed."

The most enjoyable part of my job is making customers smile, because I've helped them in some sort of way even if it's just saying, ""hello, may I help you?"""
good,"Home depot, is an investment to make in applying, if there is one company that knows how to deal with employees, it's home depot."
good,"Great culture, full of a lot of people who care about what they do. If you are a company person and put in your time, you can advance. Pay leaves something to be desired, but it gets better with time and advancement."
good,A typical work day consists of serving our customers beyond their expectations.
good,So far working there has been a positive experience. The training system is well thought out and you learn tons of stuff. Staff are very helpfull. This is a great company to work for.
good,Logged data regarding product received by company in company’s database
good,"This job was a great stepping stone for work experience. I had a fun time working for Home Depot, they treat their employees well."
good,"Excellent company to work with, fast pace Retail based company, has weathered the down turn of the economy pretty well, store sales have flattened out but they continue to hire the best associates for the positions in the store."
good,"The company is good to work for, for a temporary job placement. It is a good thing to have prior experience with home improvement employment."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Home Depot, it is a family and they try to help every one of it's employees out in difficult time.The have flexible scheduling which is great for students ans any one looking for a second job."
good,The only bad part of Home depot was some of the management. Wish there was more good thing I could say about them. I enjoyed working there.
good,Home Depot is a great compnay to work for. There are many opportunities for advancement. It provides an environment to learn new things everyday. The customer interaction is amazing if you show the willingness to learn.
good,Home Depot is good company to work with. It has more opportunities offer to its employees. more chances of advancement.
good,"Its a great company,I've been with this company for 5 1/2 yrs .great benefits."
good,"As long as you don't want to climb too high up into management, this is a great job. I tried to climb too high (Assistant manager) but was left in the wind. Otherwise though it is a very good job and if you like home improvement and then please go for it."
good,Fun and interactive place to help fulfill dreams of the customers and learn about a business. Plus learning about quality products that could benefit you when buying a home.
good,Home Depot is a terrific company to work for.  They provided me untold years experience in many areas but they have one huge glaring problem.  They incompetence at the local level with store management that is not capable of doing their jobs or worse is on some sort of power trip.  Once they improve that you should be able to really strive to be at the top.
good,"The health benefits and assistance/aid program especially for employees. The bad may been bad circulation and the rush concept, but as overall good company to work for."
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is. Is seeing a smile on people face when I help them out with a order . It is good bowing I could help somebody and make them so happy.
good,"I have had a varied career with the Home Depot, I’ve met some great people, learned a lot with varied job experiences, it’s a good work culture they give back to the employees, encourage their employees and are very supportive. I’ve been with the company through several buyouts but feel this one is the right fit."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo y una administración adecuada, sin embargo la división de trabajo entre los diferentes puestos no era del todo equitativa"
good,"Having the opportunity to greet customers, helping with their needs, working with a happy staff, moving around on job site not standing or being in one place"
good,"Good benefits which start immediately upon hiring "
good,"I loved working for Home Depot, but as time went on, my hard work was not valued. When I first started as a student they worked with my school schedule. Once I finished school and took a break and had more time to insert myself in the company, I got promoted. After my promotion I strived to become full time, but that was not accomplished. Then Home Depot became less flexible."
good,This company took me in even with a gap in my working history. They were able to teach me everything I needed to succeed. The managers were on point and the co-workers were very helpful.
good,"It's a typical retail warehouse job, except you deal with hammers and entitled contractors who demand the world and then some. The work culture is alright."
good,Home depot was a good company to work for.  The Management teams effectiveness differed from store to store.  I had two very different teams.  One was very proactive about working and helping their employees.  The other was poor at delegating responsibilities and holding employees accountable for their actions.
good,"Working at the home depot was very fun. I really enjoyed my time there and training is provided for anyone that has the desire to learn. If you show commitment, they will too."
good,I learned what hard work is. Not only that but that there is genuine love outside of home or outside of your everyday peers. I felt as if I was working with family members or loved one’s when working for Home Depot.
good,Sometimes hours can get in the way of balancing life outside of work. Hiring process could be lengthened to help decide on better candidates for employment.
good,"During my three years working at home depot, I was a full-time student and I was able to choose my work availability around classes. Sometimes I was only able to work weekends but that's the time its the busiest and need more help."
good,"Always joy and happiness for the majority. Almost always have food for employees, always felt like a family environment. Loved the people and customers... for most part lol"
good,"The home depot is a good place to work , its flexible and you learn a lot. The employees are like a family there. They push you do better and inspire you to be better at what you do there and prepare you for what you leaning to do after home depot."
good,"It’s a great place to work for but the pay for the type of work must be increased."
good,I count myself lucky to have had a chance to meet and learn from incredible people. They encourage growth within the store and company. Working with customers is not always easy. Yet there was always supports and opportunities to learn.
good,"The Home Depot is a great company to work for, really good benefits and they treat their employees very well. I get along with management really well and there is a lot of opportunity to move up though it can take a while. Overall, I really enjoy working for The Home Depot."
good,"enjoyed working and meeting new people.  The hardest part was to "
good,"Friendly environment to work in, no discrimination, others are willing to help when needed. And they are flexible with school. They offer benefits for part time employees which not all companies do, and have tuition reimbursement if applicable. I also get to interact with customers and help them find a color that will work for their area."
good,"The Home Depot was an amazing workplace with associates that work hard to make the store move as smoothly as possible. Management wasn't the best at the time of my employment, besides that the whole working experience was awesome and those associates are family."
good,Good place to work at for the most part everyone is every nice and inclusive. There are always opportunities for advancement. There are really flexible hours and time off.
good,helps you build your career. the managers that I have worked with are good. it is a good company in general if you follow the rules and it is definitely a company where you can get promoted fast.
good,The Management cares about their employees and customers. The employees care about and support each other. They provide excellent training for all associate positions and are eager to train those who are eager to learn.
good,HD spends a lot of time on perfecting employee morale with events at the local store - most events are catered with various restaurants foods. I worked for the airlines and Home Depot Takes them. I was very impressed with the amount of kindness and caring that management portrays. I'm very happy with my choice of work at the home depot - even though their hourly pay can use a fine tuning :)
good,"Be willing to sacrifice any weekly routine at home if you want to move up. Its a never ending cycle of customer service qnd fast paced merchandising.  If you can get everyone to take part in the work load then you can create a fun and competitive  work environment.  Take the time to train, guide, and Instill confidence in those around you or watch new hires quit over and over agaIn"
good,"I like it. It's a change from what I'm used to doing. But just like anywhere else, not every coworker is a team player. Some people complain about doing what they were hired to do. For the most part it's good. I get along with everyone, do my job and go home. But at my age I would need 3 jobs to serve. I was making $11.00 per hr in 1988."
good,"The pay is great compared to other entry-level jobs. Management can be pretty chill depending on who you have. sometimes you can leave early if you finish your department, which depends on your co-worker(s). The people you meet there are very cool and will be long-time friends. The benefits available are amazing. What I do not like about Home Depot and why I decided to leave is that their hours are very bipolar. AS a partime worker, I didn't expect to have a lot of hours. However, I do expect to have constant hours. Home Depot will give you 20+ hours one week or for two weeks, and the only give you one or two days. It is very unreliable if you are financing something or planning to save for something. Also, they say that workers are important to them after the customers but I think that's false. They reduced our hours to 16 to 0 hours because black Friday was coming which I think is messed up because Christmas was coming up and needed the money for gifts. Overall, a great place to work in compared to other jobs i used to work at"
good,"I learned to observe my fellow workers and to congratulate them in public and to chastise in private. Helping others being great at there job, giving good customer service and being productive makes a great work environment."
good,"Very nice environment to learn and grow in lots of different areas. Hard work, can get stressful especially when helping customers. Everyone is usually helpful and in a decent mood."
good,Home Depot was my first job I thought I could make a career out of it and I love the amount of opportunity they give you for being a good worker. There was great management and a safe and cultured place to work.
good,"Like any other retail job, customer service skills come in handy. This job provides areas of growth as a person. Home Depot has a belief that if the employees are taken care of, everything else should be functioning as intended. That being said, you (the associate) are important in their eyes."
good,"It was a good job ok pay . I was a sales associate in the garden department it was kind of a boring job , and customers would ask you about all the things in the department and how they work and about the plants and I had no idea . Lol overall okay to work for , nice management"
good,"Co-works are nice.  "
good,"empresa donde haces carrera como asociado y tu pones tus limites para crecer ,ayudas al cliente"
good,"The atmosphere is great but you get paid minimum for an exceptional amount of work. Prepare for customer complaints, "
good,"After being laid off from my previous part-time position when the business closed in 2009, I decided to work only my main job for 3 years before applying to Home Depot in 2012 for the added income. I enjoy working with the great staff at my Home Depot and the customers who for the most part are very friendly. The work schedule is flexible and allows me to take care of other matters whenever I need to."
good,Management was firm but fair. My department head was hard working and her attitude inspired me to work as hard as I could. Ultimately she was very encouraging.
good,I enjoyed helping customers with their needs and I built great relationships with co workers and customers through hard work and great customer service
good,"It's not the best job, but the environment of the workplace is good enough for you to feel welcome and secure with other associates. They train you well and emphasize your safety and your rights, and give you a lot of benefits that you should be taking advantage of. Everyone is friendly and helpful. The only iffy thing about it is that if you're part time, they rotate your hours, so one week you work 40 hours, and the next you work 10 hours. They also reduce your hours if you don't help maintain the ratings of the store. The good part of it though is that you can request training to work in another department so you won't get bored, and can get promoted if you're experienced enough. Overall, you should work here if you just need some sort of income."
good,"Co-workers and Management were beyond excellent; Management was always very supportive of their employees and treated them with the utmost respect. Extensive customer service training, and always new things to learn. Always something to do while at work"
good,I had a very good review and I was very  straight  to the point  and very informative on both sides.I is a bit of fast pasted at times and different  seasons it offers a lot of different  perspectives on different  holidays.And also  I get to meet and greet a lot of different  people.
good,"You get a lot of physical work out of it, lots of walking, but great chances to meet with customers and creat connections. Networking and ethics are key there."
good,Must be wiling to put in the time and be flexible to the ever changing retail landscape in order to make advancements within the company.  Associates are well paid and are provided with excellent benefits.
good,"I had a great experience learned about the company . Was able to meet new people ,also got over my fear of pets working there And gained more experience in machinery I loved Home Depot."
good,The freight can be overwhelming at night sometimes. Not enough body's in one department to finish. The manager does a good job of putting more body's in the department that has the most freight to work. Associates are friendly and willing to help out the next.
good,"A typical day consisted of bringing in carts, assisting customers with loading heavy products, and lending a hand to the cashiers, garden center, and lumber department when needed. The work was a bit menial and tedious, especially in the summer, but the pay was good for the position, which made my efforts worthwhile to me."
good,Very physicality demanding job. Good benefits. Management had its ups and downs. They work with the associates with problems inside and outside of work.
good,"I have worked with the Home Depot for 2 years and it is a great place to work, management is good and it’s jusy and overall good company to work for. There are many options for you to advance within the company and even cross train between departments"
good,Big and busy environment. Fully productive during the peak season(summer). We had short meetings everyday before actual work began. they served drinks and snacks sometimes.
good,"Lots of Management support. Atlanta writes schedule to match metrics, not for real life. Overall very nice store to work at. Customer service in general can be a drag, but you get out what you put in."
good,"Pretty good job, except scheduling was difficult. Trying to get people to take shifts happened rarely, and that’s the reason I had to leave my job there."
good,I loved working for this company very family friendly would of continued to work there but the pay verse the commute wasnt worth it  I’m trying to get back on in Modesto if they would let me for part time
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers cut wood, answering any of a customers' questions and following what the manager wants done by the end of the week."
good,Great place to work very flexible hours are great. You get to meet all sorts of people and you really learn about safety. Pay is great for what you do.
good,"Great company to work, the job gave me tools to be more productive and  experience on Home Improvement supporting the customers in their needs, offering to assist with emphaty and a smile."
good,"good for someone willing to work hard, great management team, pay is slightly above min wage. great benefits for full or part time. strong in training, strong and friendly management team, great work culture, if they increased pay would have less turn over"
good,"The management was good , I learned alot about plumbing on the job and forklifting. It taught me alot that helps me with everyday life today , I helped customers figure out their home problems , and also , helped load their vehicle when purchase items using the forklift if neccessary"
good,I usually do refunds and returns as well as pick orders from shelves & help with delivery issues. It was very stressful at times & management sometimes did not make it any better
good,"Working at the Home Depot opened up allot of doors for my future job experiences. I started with customer services skills up to driving forklifts, to picking orders."
good,I enjoy the family like atmosphere with my fellow employees and all the knowledge I picked up throughout my years with Home Depot. I enjoyed the trust and respect I received from the management team and fellow employees during my time in the vault
good,The Home Depot was a great place to work for and i miss my boss and all of my colleagues. The work was intense but i really enjoyed my job. The staff was always friendly.
good,I enjoy working with people in this environment. Team work is essential. You can move up through the ranks fairly quickly if you have the drive. The stock options are awesome and so are the benifets.
good,"I love customer service, at Home Depot I was able to interact with different people. Just love how much I was able to learn from customers and coworkers."
good,Its a great job everyone has an important role to get customers like contractors in and out so they could get back out on the job. Overall it made the day go by fast.
good,Very fast pace...high demand.  Great managers. Friendly coworkers.  Homer fund . great work parties. All dept. Heads are well revised in everything they do.
good,"This was a sales job so typically your day could start any time of the day. There was definitely a lot of paper work to keep up with as well as phone calls to customers.The management is very understanding and well rounded. They are will to make changes to your day while keeping you motivated. The hardest part of the job were the inconsistent work hours. You could leave your home as early as 6 am and not get back until 10 at night. The best part of the job, however, was the money. If you were on top of everything that you had to do, the paychecks will speak for themselves."
good,The Home Depot has given me the tools to learn how to safely and efficiently get any project done with a reliable source of local experts. These tips and tricks can then be passed from generation to generation ensuring the job get done right.
good,"High energy management. The job itself is extremely boring and repetitive, so management has no choice but to be annoyingly energetic. Simple, easy job."
good,Great learning experience and helps build character. MEt some great friends and associates. Had benefits that helped save money and discounts for life enjoyment.
good,"You might be more qualify for a position than others, but doesn’t matter. Who ever work in the company for  more than 20 years, , they have a better pay regardless how efficient he/she is in that position...."
good,"The work hours where mostly 9-5 and made me so happy to have a better work life balance. They really take care of the employees and management wants to see you grow in the company. Hardest is that somethings are stuck in a weird long process that it's hard to get them to update it, other than that, great job!"
good,Decent job but the pay could have been better and the HR rules and regulations were a bit strict. I.E. policies etc. But I overall atmosphere was ok and accommodating.
good,"Its a great place to work hard and see results. They promote from within and frequently recognize hard workers. If you can deal with the common retail stress, it is a rewarding place to work."
good,"Home depot as a great culture. They take care of their employees and honestly believe in putting customers first. They have great benefits and  are willing to work with you. The do tuition reimbursement and have roadside assistance for employees. They take time to train you, celebrate wins, holidays, and birthdays."
good,"Days are not too bad, the occasional rush of customers here and there. Co-workers and management are great people. It can be physically demanding for the most part so definitely be prepared for heavy lifting and working with lift equipment."
good,"I worked nights part time packing down bays.  The manager was great and allowed for overtime work.  I was able to take classes during the day and work at night so it was not stressful, but a somewhat physically demanding depending on the amount that was delivered that night."
good,"Hd contact center was a great place to work. They love and value their employees. If there is anything I disliked, it would be the point system they have for attendance. 6 months for 1 point to fall off. Besides that the culture, management & pay were pretty good.  Benefits are a bit too expensive."
good,Working at home depot was an interesting experience. You would handle any and every type of customer that came into your department. The hardest part of the job was dealing with experienced customers who knew more than you at a specific department. Once you knew how to handle them it made everything else easy. The managers respected you and would listen when you would talk to them about anything. The culture surrounding home depot was really family oriented and comforting.
good,"Loved learning lots of new things about everything in the area I was working it was fast pase and that is what I like , I like to keep moving and working and learning new stuff it has great staff as well ."
good,The culture at HD is great especially within the Finance department. There is a strong focus on promoting from within. You get a chance to work in a cutting edge environment with some of the best leaders in the industry.
good,"Worked at the warehouse, unloading and loading"
good,"If you're looking for a company that values it's employees, then The Home Depot is right for you. They have great benefits, the pay is nice, and you have the opportunity to advance."
good,Working environment is good but not paid enough. The annually increase is not as much as the province increase... And some of the supervisors don't know how to work..
good,"Working at The Home Depot provides a lot of benifits including a good work culture and work life balance."
good,"Home Depot was a great place for me to grow and learn new things and for the most part, the managers were helpful and loved to teach and help associates grow."
good,you like to help customers and there home building needs this is the place to be. There is always something new to learn and being able to asset customer
good,"I've only worked for the company a few months so I have limited experience. I'm part time and that allows a great deal of flexibility, which I need at present."
good,At The Home Depot it is clear what your responsibilities are: the customer. A day revolves around customer service and making sure the store is maintained for easy shopping. Management is supportive in doing anything they can to help associates give customers the best experience possible. While working for The Home Depot I have learned a lot about home improvement and the workings of a successful business. The Home Depot is a good company to work for where I feel respected.
good,awesome job to work at either for a young person that wants a lot of hours and likes working or for an older person also its for both but if you like walking running and lifting thats the job for u.
good,"The culture is very positive. They really seem to care about their employees. Management is by and large accessible, and concerns are quickly addressed. Can vbe a fun place to work."
good,"This job is a great part time job. They do very good at being able to work around your class schedule and make it easy for you. It is hard at first because you must deal with people who get mad if you dont know where things are, but once you figure out where things are it gets a llot easier."
good,I like the benefits Home Depot provides. For students you can get tuition reimbursement and have a schedule planned around your schooling. It's a cooperate job and there are rules you cant change but if you do your job well they normally reconfigure that.
good,"Im still working for Home Depot, I’ve proven myself multiple times over and over that I am capable of moving up in the company. Hasn’t happened yet and my current pay doesn’t help me with my bills. My current management is great, I just feel we can do better at paying associates for what they do rather than what they think they do."
good,I enjoyed the benefits and my co workers. Customers were nice enjoyable conversations with co workers and customers alike. Holiday parties and raffles. They also monthly ordered food out for the employees
good,"empresas líder en  tecnológicas "
good,I learned a lot about working in collaboration with others. The work place relies heavily on communication between associates and MET. The hardest part is when situations are thrown at you and there is no one around to help. This calls for quick on your feet thinking on how to handle problems the best way possible. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. Everyone is very friendly and willing to help.
good,I enjoyed my time working with the Home Depot. If you stick it out the longevity associates get taken care of. I feel if I started this job when i was younger that I could have really gone places.
good,"I loved  Friday because its a busy day and I use to be very busy there helping customers to look for what they need. I loved the management, it was very professional .I thing  Home depot has the most good quality of customer service. The hardest part of the job was when it was slow and we didn't have enough sale and the enjoyable part was helping people to find what they need."
good,Forklift operating for incoming merchandise deliveries and general in-store stocking/duties. Cutting lumber to precise length for customers needs. Experienced in customer service and general sales within the lumber department. Back-up cashier when needed.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my job at The Home Depot. It was, in my opinion, a rewarding position. Management was pleasant for the most part. The true gem, however, was the fellow employees. They are what got me out of bed and into work."
good,"Training was offered on a daily basis and this went a long way in helping employees learn the job expectations and making them feel comfortable in their positions."
good,Plenty of help if needed. Takes a while to learn the departments of a huge warehouse but once you did it was a great feeling. Early morning starts made it easier to restock products. I did lots of projects like resting bays and setting up for Halloween Christmas and spring sales. My supervisor was a very good one and was sad to see her get promoted.
good,"Just enough income ($11/hr: New Hire) to be fair amount with physical work & all responsibilities.  Incentives such as store Success Share bonuses (2x yearly) and superb benefits (beyond just the national norm for benefits). The stock options I suggest buying in on if you become an employee!"
good,"During my time at Home Depot, I made a lot of great connections with my coworkers as well as the managers. I left because I felt underappreciated; a lot of my coworkers in other departments would not do their necessary tasks and would leave them to me, even though I was not within their department."
good,"Pay was competitive. Sometimes the job was physically demanding. Occasional rude customers. I have had some of the best managers here, however I have also had some of my worst,"
good,working in retail help you develop your skills and know how to treat people better. The management team will show you not only how to treat customer but also the attitude to have. The most enjoyable part is to leave a customer with satisfaction a smile on his face or when the customer remember your name.
good,Home depot was a great place to work. The advancement opportunities were great for contributing productive associates. Great holiday parties and team building.
good,Associates were able to make key decisions. It was a great team work job everyone looked out for each other. There were a lot of perks that came with it and the challenge between stores keep you on your toes
good,"While working there, taking care of the customers is not difficult, however some of the demands can be unfair. Everyone there is friendly and family oriented, there's a lot that is provided for the associates. Some requirements (overall stats, upper level interpretation, call handle time) do not provide the job any merits, as they are not definite with a precise answer. It does reach out to help the community and attempts to look out for it's associates, just be cautious."
good,Fun place to work with a lot of room for growth. They emphasize working hard rather than credentials is what helps you move up within the company. Good times and work load.
good,"Most days are like a typical work day. Not alot of customers and you get to focus more on restocking shelves and keeping isles clean.  But overall i loved working there. The asms, "
good,HOME DEPOT was a good company to work for they provided excellent insurance through ANTHEM.  Their was of course the usual retail turnover but that's expected over all a good place.
good,excelente desempeño por parte de los asociados y por parte del equipo de staff crean un hambiente de confort para que los empleados se sientan comodos en sus respectivos puestos
good,"I've done the tour of warehouse  jobs in my area. Starting off the pay isn't great but in 2 years I've gone from 14.25 to 17.70. Most of that was site wide cost of living adjustment and the recent tax change also gave us a bump."
good,This position is a very slow paced job and I like to keep busy and work..makes time go faster.  Everyone was helpful while I was working.  I would not recommend this position if you like a fast pace.
good,"It’s a big company so everyone has their jobs and it’s very fast paced. Time flew by which I liked, everyone helps you out if you asked. There’s always a lot of people working there , it was a fun job"
good,"I was a part time worker when i was at the home depot and i worked night shift from 9pm-5am.it was a very loveable, condusive,and highly demanding working enviroment,which affords the opportunity to learn a lot,and acquire several skills,ranging from customer relations,freight,folklifts operation for specific tasks,effective collaborative efforts & excellent communications amongst workers etc."
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work while going to college. What I honesty learned about this place is time management on balancing your work and school. Management is lenient overall on schedules and they will tailor a schedule around your classes. I personally worked the Overnight Freight Team because of weekends off, and the culture in the workplace is good. Everyone plays a roll in the Freight Team. A typical day at work consist of unloading freight, stocking the shelves, and getting the store grand opening ready for the day. Every month, the team has a conference meeting that consist of reviews on our district sales, giving awards to associates standing out, and getting a free lunch. Overall a great place to work wile going to school."
good,HD is a good place to work with really good benefits. Only thing bad I can say is that they pay is on the low end until you become an ASM. Most entry level managers will make $14 per hour
good,Great work environment loved the team effort to meet the customers needs. Loved my time there and if offered A higher position I would go back. Management was A great!
good,"Working at Home Depot taught me many things I encounter every day in my life. The managers were always helpful and always helped with your hours. Plus, they give you many benefits that you may need."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is I learn so much about working as a team and also working individually. "
good,"They really care about their employees. However in my experience, they weren't able to work with my school schedule. Excellent pay for the position and a great entry or retirement job!"
good,"If you are part time or full time the benefits of working for this company can pay off if stick with it or find the right positions to work."
good,"Company leads by example and culture is very evident."
good,"Great company to work for, amazing work environment, great benefits and hours. Work life balance works out great. Supervisors have great relationships with their associates as well as managers that give you the tools you need to advance in the company."
good,"Management is very supportive about schedule requests."
good,"It was fun working at the customer service area. Upbeat, quick paced, exciting, I learned a lot of skills while over there. However, the general manager had some favoritism towards the much older workers over there."
good,I loved working here I just would like more hours for better pay. I learned alot of things such as customer service skills and management skills. Overall a very good place to work.
good,Other than the hours- the best employer there is!!! Anyone with a strong work ethic can have an amazing career with HD. The culture is amazing and the environment is thriving.
good,the hardest part of my job was to work productively when the ones around you are lazy. my store manager was honestly the best most caring person I'd had ever met. I enjoyed building a bond and friendship to those customers that were so kind and patient.
good,"Overall Home Depot is a good company to work for. They offer a lot of help and support for their employees which is something I have never gotten out of a corporate environment before. "
good,Great opportunity to learn different departments and expand your knowledge.  All training is computer based with hands on instruction by department supervisor after training completion.
good,"I enjoyed working for the home depot, and I would recommend anyone who is just starting out in their work life to consider starting here. Good pay for good work."
good,"Management is awesome and are willing to work with students school schedule.  Management  have a vested interest in your dreams and support you to the best of their ability.  HD's  volunteering opportunities are pretty cool too.  There are lots of departments to chose from and you eventually find you niche.  Hardest part of the job ....there isn't really a hard part to the job.  The entire team for the most part  has a supportive attitude toward helping customers and helping each other.  If you stay out of work place drama you will be fine.    The people I worked with definitely made my time there enjoyable.

good,"One of the best jobs I have ever had. Most of managers were very caring and very hands on.. Customer Satisfaction #1 Priority besides safety. If you plan on working at Home Depot, I Highly recommend on  your first day or even in your interview process, ask about the Manager and the Tire story. That story will give you perspective on how Serious serving the customers are. You have a lot of lead way at the job, to satisfy the customer and to assure that you and the customer are comfortable; just remember you are still at work. If you work in special services, service desk expect a challenge. The customer service desk might just be one of the hardest positions in Home depot if not the hardest. It all depends on who you work with and your supervisor you have for support. The job does not have to be hard,it can be challenging at times but if you have a great service desk team it will work out great. Another great note is that there are a lot of benefits for employees, they really care about making employees feel great so they can go on and satisfy the customers.. Highly recommend to get in the 401k and take interest in the stock.  It does not matter if  you are Part time or Full time it can be a very fun job, remember to wear comfortable shoes"

good,"Depending on the shift. I worked both night and days, Nights were face paced and pretty chill. restocking and cleaning up the store without customers was alright. Days were more social due to customers approaching and asking for hep. I typically was helping get carts or loading vehicles for customers. "

good,loved the work environment and the quality of workers that are hired for each department. Recognize achievements  of the workers. good work life balance.
good,"An average work day would start with clocking in, then being thrown about to assist customers, Bring in carts, give loading assistance to customers (at least 40 pounds per item), Isle maintenance, and plant tending (watering, and pruning when necessary). Breaks are hard to fit in without making somebody upset for not being there."
good,"Helping customers to fulfill there shopping needs."
good,Working at The Home Depot was fun.  My part-time work afforded me the ability to enjoy things outside of work.  My schedule requests were almost always honored.
good,"As a cashier working at Home Depot it became dull. The environment is nice, but you easily get bored after being in one location for two or more hours. Management was understandable and did what they could to create a workable environment. If you’re a hard worker who likes to learn Home Depot is a good place to work."
good,The employees were are relaxed and friendly creating a great atmosphere and the resources the THD provided gave a chance for individuals to learn and advance all on their own whenever they wanted.

good,"I loaded trucks for ten hours a day, but the job started at $13.00 per hour, which was good for the area.  The training was adequate, although it was easy to be faulted for errors that were not of my doing.  For example, several employees may work on the same trucks at different times, and if the load was not proper, then there was no true way to know who was at fault."
good,Overall a great company to work for. The store manager was very understanding and easy to work for. The continual training I received helped me to provide the superb customer service for our customers.
good,"This place really took care oftheir employees, alot of room fro advancement and growth in this company they had great benefits and took the time to train their employees well"

good,"The home depot is a great company, I have good managers at my store however at this time there is no room for me to grow. Seeking a higher entry level"
good,"Overall this is a great job for people who can be active and adapt on the fly. I really didn't have any problems with anyone I worked with other than the managers. I understand that not everywhere is going to be great or blessed with great managers but sometimes the ones at the store I worked at were very unreasonable. They told me whenever I was hired that they could work with my schedule but most of the time when I requested a change they would decline it which is understandable but sometimes I would give them a very valid reason (school, family, etc.) and they refused. So just watch out for that."
good,Assist all customer's with in stock and special order sells. Assist Customer with online orders. Assist customer with on line pick up orders. Assist customer with phone sells.
good,I really liked working here i would’ve stayed and progressed within the ranks it’s just the pay was to low and i couldn’t afford it. Other then that i really enjoyed being there the people were nice and the job was simple.
good,"Most relaxed place I ever worked. The job itself was cool, I got to meet a lot of cool people (customers and workers). The busy days help the time move. The busy days are not stressful."
good,"for those that are into very fast-paced work, and a cutthroat work life, its a relatively nice place to work at. the turnaround seems to be high, but can always get new employees in."
good,Good hours and benefits. the whole motto is bleeding orange and helping the customers . the ware house can be a fun but stressful environment. its a lot of work to load trailers. overall good company.
good,Lots of room for advancement if you put in the effort and don't mind the hours. Great job for young people just out of High School to learn what the workforce is all about.
good,"Hard learning all the new products received."

good,"I really enjoyed my time at home depot, but I was a high schooler surrounded by other high schoolers. The duties of a cashier can be stressful at times, but since I was under 18, I didn't have to do the job that people quit over-- guest services. Guest services really does do the dirty work and can take an emotional toll on people. Work at Home Depot, its fun-- just say no to working in guest services."
good,Great Work the company give management and employee great training and counseling if needed. Love working here wish I could return (Got sick and doctor said I need to take off for a while then I moved also). But I love the Job

good,Home Depot culture is a very proud and upbeat culture. They love where they came from and where they are going. I work at 1 of the 3 locations in the United States and we are split into teams but these teams become your family. Your supervisors and managers push you to be the best in customer service because it is all about the effortless customer experience and gaining and continuing the loyalty with the customers.
good,"One of my favorite jobs I've held. Management was very organized, fair to all of the employees. Culture was so fun, laid back but when it was time to work everyone seemed to understand it was go time."

good,"I enjoyed my time at the Home Depot, although it was slow most days because of the area I worked in the environment was a very pleasant one with coworkers that actually cared about your personal life and not just your work one."
good,"As with my previous review I was busy with school when I was working here. I was young when I worked here, didn't know how to take any constructive criticism and while things ended poorly, I felt that I could've learned a lot here. The customers and staff were great, although at the age of 18 I didn't know how to be mindful and such. However putting that aside I can see that the hardest part was just being dedicated to the project instead of letting outside stuff get in the way."
good,Home Depot is a good place to work.  The management and co workers respect me and treat me fairly.  It can be a stressful place t work some days but its all part of retail.  I learn new things everyday working there about different products and how to help customers.
good,"I am a Cashier at Home Depot. I also work at returns and self checkout. The workplace is like a warehouse (dusty, busy and loud at times). It is an easy job once you get the hang of it, but it can get very busy at times. Employees and customers are diverse. the hardest part of the job was at the beginning when learning how everything works such as returns, processing checks and looking items up on a cashier online book. It is easy now. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and helping them when needed."
good,"I enjoyed the sale's independence in working at the Home Depot. I was either selling inside the stores or attending outside sales appointments. "

good,Productive and fun workplace. You can learn a lot of applied knowledge from this job. Its very hands on and very rewarding work. The company will definitely take care of you.

good,"I'm a head cashier so my hardest part of the job is dealing with customers. My cashiers are great and they listen to me. The management kind of sucks but it depends upon who is the MOD. Honestly, we get paid to stand around; it's the easiest job you could have."
good,"I like working at Home Depot, my only problem is my current financial situation, I need full time job to be able to cover my financial needs."
good,Very family and community oriented company. They have a lot of programs available to help the employees and their families. Company provides a food pantry for employees.
good,I like working at the gone depot most of the time but the hours are very inconsistent. Some weeks i have 16 hours some i get 25. Every now and then we're allowed to go over 28 hrs but it's rare. I love that we get regular bonus check twice a year. The dental and vision plans are pretty good.
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work. The people are friendly, the associates are helpful and we work as a team. Our management team assure us they will take care of our questions and concerns and address them accordingly."
good,"At least at my store, management cared about the employees, how well we performed. An associate has freedom to handle customers, like giving small discounts and making decisions. The company itself is great, store employees can get biyearly profit sharing checks on top of regular pay. Great for advancement, like most managers started as associates. Pay was fair. Winters were incredibly boring but our store is in the north, so no one paints during the winter."
good,"At Home Depot, the interaction with co-workers and customers made every day a new experience.  The corporate culture is that of a team mentality.  Independent though and creativeness are encouraged and rewarded.  The pay is very good and the bonus/stock reward are some of the best in the industry.  The only difficult part of the role is the schedule.  Retail hours are difficult when raising children and sometimes the work/life balance takes a backseat to providing results."
good,"Contract position, but I very much enjoyed it. Smart people and in my role I had exposure to all levels of the organization. They seemed to allow the changing of teams/responsibilities to keep things fresh which is a unique approach."

good,I started out in Chicago area and my husband got transferred to the St. Louis area and they were kind enough to transfer me as well. I enjoyed working for them
good,"The emphasis on employee appreciation was very welcoming. There was always an opportunity to show the employees they were the reason the company is in business. Their motto was ""treat your staff well an they will treat your customers well""."
good,"The Home depot is a good company to work for.  With the many chances for advancements in the job site, you will have many chances to move up.  I did have a variety of store managers who rotated through the store putting many things in flux,"
good,home depot was a great place to work.Management always willing to help with work load or help if there is a family problem or medical reason.Will highly recommend working there
good,I got the opportunity to learn a lot of new skills and developed great relationships. I started from the bottom and worked my way up in no time! I’m a hard worker and like to learn new things!

good,"Be ready to work for your money and be willing to do any job that needs doing, and management appreciates that. A lot of multitasking is needed to keep customers happy."
good,This job was good because it kept you on your toes. You basically have your own department to run. As long as you know and recognize you stock then you should have no problems.
good,Being a cashier at The Home Depot was great I allowed me. To meet s many different people it was great cause it allowed me to advance my social skill with customer coworkers and management. It is relaxed but also great when rush hour hit. Keeping busy was not an issue

good,"You have to be open to learn different things, and to work all over, customers care, be a hard worker, if you are a kind person you wouldn’t have a problem, cuatomers love that"
good,"It is a very fast past and competitive environment surrounded by great people and great customers. There are always new challenges, thus new things to learn! I think it is a great part-time job!"
good,I was fortunate enough to see 3 states thru this job as they moved me to help open new stores. This was great for me until my children need to be settled in a home area and continue with school.
good,"A typical day at work : consulting customers on windows, shutters, roofing, and gutters. I would explain the differences between Home Depot and why they should do business with us."
good,"I had a difficult job for a part time position. I was paid to put together orders that were placed online or in store for pickup or delivery. The difficulty lay in the number of hours needed to put orders together and the number of times an order would be half completed when the shift ended. My opinion is that they should have had a full time person in this position instead of multiple part time people. It also added to the stress of what would have been a laid-back job because one was required to turn over the incomplete job to an intermediary, a decently sized step that could have been avoided daily. Overall still a great place to work."
good,"the hardest part of the work is lifting heavy stuff to a cart,the work place is much cultured,respect is 100%.i have met a lot people with different accent,which am getting used to now.have learnt much personal interactions with home depot..."
good,It’s a good place to work but you don’t get enought hours. Everyone is very friendly and very reliable to can’t on for help. And promotions are way to rare.
good,"We have a start up meeting where we discuss how productivity was the day before, and we also talk about the plans we have for to current day and our goals for the current day, and we are also told our assignments for the day. I work mostly in reciving, there i empty the trailer containers of the incoming product, label it and then recieve it sytomatically into the invatory then begin phyically putting it away into its proper location. At this job i have learned how to operate all of the M.H.E equipment Clamp,Sitdown Pacer, etc. Ive also learned all of the following job functions putaway, recieving, picking and unloading. The work place culture is good as well as the management we all look out for each other and help each other as much as we can. The hardest part of the job would be probably at season change because its when we have the highest demand of product going out and coming in. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and driving the equipment."
good,"Lo que mas agrada dentro de la empresa, es que si hay oportunidades para todas las personas..."
good,"I work the nights here and on nights we don't have a truck it's pretty relaxed.  We just do shelf maintenance and organization.  On truck nights, it is fast paced.  I tend to work later on those nights to accommodate for the larger workload.  I wish we'd get paid a few more dollars an hour, but overall a great place to work at."

Indoor products and outside commodities, lumber/building materials, soils and plants ....UPS/FedEx, DC trucks, daily forklift inspections, HAZ Mat and Transfer System... Some managers were great some not with their understanding of the workload I dealt with on a daily basis though they did realize what I contributed once I left Home Depot when my wife was transferred to Houston, Texas..... The hardest part of the job was receiving 8-12 trucks daily being the only receiver during the day shift !!!! some days were Brutal !!!! And the most enjoyable part was many of the wonderful employees I was able to interact with !!!!"

good,"the home depot is a great place to work. they offer a lot of good benefits. the culture is inspirational. unfortunately, all of the great benefits, as well as the culture, are not enough to make up for the lack of financial compensation.

good,I enjoyed my time there. Most of the management cared about the employees. My store manager was a great leader and took care of his team. Only reason I left was because I relocated with the family.
good,The Home Depot was an awesome place to work at. Unfortunate for me it was not paying enough and the hours I was given weren't working for my school schedule nor my personal life.
good,"The Home Depot was founded on the principles of respect, community, and people first. The Home Depot does all they can to ensure that their people are well taken care of. They provide monetary grants to associates in need, they are flexible with scheduling, they are compassionate when personal issues arise, and they are willing to work around personal issues that may affect your performance otherwise."

good,"I learned a lot about the job and what they expected from my role. i learned how to maintain the registers, what to do when they broke down. I learned what to do in the middle of a power outage. It was fun on most days and some days were pretty stressful. The workplace culture wasn't what they described in the interview but it was tolerable. The pay was pretty decent it paid the bills so i didn't mind so much. The most enjoyable part about the job was feeling like you were part of a family with most of your coworkers. I personally wouldn't go back to working there but I'm sure that it is a job that will suit someone just not me."
good,the home depot shares their profits randomly throughout the year. FREE MONEY. NO KIDDING. There was always food in a designated area for the less fortunate.

We must have a excellent knowledge of the products we sell, as well as the location of these products. Working at the home depot I have learned how to multitask, many ways to keep the work environment safe for us the employees and also our costumers, and how to drive multiple forklift machines. The workplace culture is very diverse and friendly. We team up with management to insure our clients are well taken care of and satisfied. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping someone; teaching them new things and ensuring that they leave the home depot with a new knowledge base as well as happy,"
good,The job is physically digficult but mentally simple. The employees and management are great as they trrat their fellow associates as family members. The benefits are fantastic but the pay is less than desired.

I enjoy working on a team and meeting new people, it provides a fun and exciting work experience."
good,Very supportive team. Everyone is very focused on results and it's a team effort to get to the goal. There's always a celebration of sorts. Birthdays and anniversaries are a big deal. Great store spirit.
good,I get to work start working the carts onto the trailers. Sometimes I'd rearrange a trailer. Some days I'd work the fluid lines. Moved freight stock and other material.
good,"Typical work day was unloading trucks from 7pm-11pm. I learned in order to get the work done in time your co-workers has to work as a team. Management was very caring and always organized, and the workplace culture was very comfortable. The hardest part on the job was to move a heavy pallet of paint and the enjoyable part was when we got the work done."

good,"Working at The Home Depot has been a great experience because I got to learn a lot of stuff that I did not know before as far as an electrical, plumbing, and paint knowledge. I enjoyed helping customers as much as I could. The only downside would be when customers did not know how to be patient or have manners because they would be very rude sometimes. They are flexible in hours but strict on call outs and no-shows."
good,Home depot is an amazing place to work. Its quick paced and a physically demanding job so you need to be able to keep up. Management is always willing to help with anything and are very understanding.
good,Wal-Mart is a great place to work. But also be a stressful place depending on your management is handling their positions same with the entire team. Customer service always been my big thing and sometimes I found it being looked over.

good,fun place to work.  good commitment to the community. Good involvement with Veterans. good focus on customer service.  very good volunteer opportunities.
good,Easy going job.  Awesome and helpful co-workers.  Room to grow and advance in management.  They encourage and advise you on how to improve and give you recommendations.
good,I was able to add more knowledge in terms of home improvements because they make constant seminars on the department you are assigned although they give it to the departments the store has.I was able to multi task because of the exposure to every department. sometimes you have to cover an absentee in a certain department so in turn you are able to learn on the job.It si very fufilling if you satisfies a customer when they tell you ...that the job was well done.
good,Working at Home Depot has been a good experience.  I approve of the management and feel that the compensation and benefits are fair.  I have a good work life balance.

good,Majority of the customers and co-workers are friendly. I enjoy going to work. There is plenty of opportunites to grow within the company for any home depot associate that has been in their position for at least 6 months.
good,"Loved the people I work with. The pay per hour and work don't add. For example, in my department I work with lumber, installation, concrete, roofing, drywall, gutters and fencing. I have to  know the key points of all these products which is fine. I love to learn new stuff and I've learned a lot since Ive started working at Home Depot. So not only does I have to know  these stuff I have too clean up 10 aisle make sure every product on every aisle is neatly place on the shelves. Make no pallets or prouduct in the overhead is wrapped up safely and not hanging from the top. Provide great customer service and put returns back on the self. Now there are other people but the last few hours before the store close's me or whoever closes is by themselves."
good,I enjoy working at The Home Depot. I have learned a lot and make lots of friends. The company allowed me to transfer and maintain a job at all times. I really like the flexible hours.
good,"-Great People"
good,This is a great company to work for with many benefits. There's always room to grow and be promoted. The Home Depot is definitely an equal opportunity employer. The entry level pay could definitely be more competitive. The Home Depot is a place of customer service. They truly care their employees and the customers shopping the store.
good,I enjoyed working here and would definitely go back if the pay was a little better. The management team worked well with me and my crazy schedule and allowed room for advancement.
good,"All of my coworkers had good attitudes and were hard workers. For me, this was a good job. Would recommend. It is very helpful if you have background knowledge in home improvement."
good,Working at the home depot helped me grow as an individual in many ways. I was able to better my interpersonal skills with people that I can now use in my future career. I was able to step out of my comfort zone and try to engage with people. Now it is second nature for me to approach people and see how they need assistance.
good,"A typical day of work included knowing product knowledge, working face to face and over the phone with customers. Two managers a day. Lot of different worker and with different knowledge. The heat was the hardest part being from Texas. Enjoyable when busy."

good,It was pretty easy days. Same things everyday. Management was understandable. The Most enjoyable part about working at home depot is being able to help the customers.
good,"Other than the poor management, I have nothing but positive words about The Home Depot. The co-workers are amazing at making sure that you are being taught exactly what you need in order to do a good job, but the attitudes in the managers, and the way that they dealt with certain customers, still leave a bad taste in my mouth."
good,I have found in working for this company that there are excellent people hired on the whole and are open to learning more about there position and customer service
good,The management of this company was exceptional. They were flexible as needed and were sympathetic towards their employees. They encouraged growth in your career.

good,"A typical day at work started with stocking and getting the departments ready for the day. Our department heads were very easy to work for and were very understanding of all situations. I learned something daily from reading, training and even from customers that came in. Home Depot was a great place to work. If I did not know something the management team would sit down and explain it and they were very understanding. If we had to work on holidays we were fed very good. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers. The greatest part of my job was meeting new people every day and learning things to help me in life."
good,"I really loved working there. Except that as an assistant manager women weren't paid same as men for same job. Otherwise you are taught to teach your employees how to work smart instead of working hard. I like the fact that at all meetings your imput was taken seriously. I wouldn't do management again. "
good,Great place to work for young adults who are interested in becoming part of management Lots of opportunities for advancement.Also good for older adults looking for something part time with Great benefits. With Flexible Hours.Great Retail learning environment.In all aspects of home interior design.as well as do it yourselfers.
good,I was head cashier. I would over see all the cashiers and give breaks. I would get the tills ready. count money do cash drops. I also gave breaks. I solved customer problems.
good,Home Depot is a great place to work.  Friendly associates always make new employees feel welcome.  Fast paced and plenty of opportunities to learn.  Free food days regularly for holidays or when certain goals are met throughout the year.
good,"As a Sales associate, you provide customer service, including directing customers to products, answering questions about goods, or assisting in purchase decisions."
good,"Depending on customer traffic, work can be slow or fast pace.  Sometimes you work by yourself and taking one customer at a time.  Co-workers do call out sick and you have to work your department alone without relief until almost end of your shift."
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabajo, se aprende y capacita constantemente, mucha responsabilidad y desempeño a la hora de realizar las labores por parte de colegas y supervisores."
good,"I really enjoyed my time working at The Home Depot.  A typical day at work goes by so fast, especially on the weekends. Also, you always have a task to do, whether it be cleaning the aisles, assisting customers or restocking. Its a good workplace."
good,During my time spent with The Home Depot I had the privilege of working side by side many great associates. Every day could throw different scenarios at us. Typically I had to juggle multiple assignments and drive customer service.  What I learned was how to get the best out of associates and how to deal with all types of people. The hardest part of the job was mostly the associate turnover and/or trying to get associates to see the vision of their roles.
good,I started out with The Home Depot as a cashier in the store.  I then got a promotion within 6mths.  I enjoyed working at Home Depot.  Home Depot was a melting pot.   The hardest part of the job was that i felt i was not growing any more with the company.  I felt stagnant.
good,"Lo que mas me gusto fue que siempre había un ambiente de trabajo sano, buen compañerismo y sobre todo el trabajo en equipo."
good,"Returned for a second summer of working. Straight-forward job, nothing out of the ordinary. Lots of staff my age that I connected with. REALLY good training. Pay and time off was all online which was efficient. Only issue was that departments changed around products frequently so when customers would ask for location of products you weren't always sure if you actually knew exactly where they were."
good,"You are on register for 8.5 hours a day. I learned how to smile when I didn't want to e.g. bad mood, problem customer. Many managers in the company are good but mine are not the best. The culture is great to be in but give occurrences when you are late. Hardest part of the job is standing on concrete for long periods of time. Most enjoyable are my coworkers, they have become family to me."
good,"I worked as a Hardware sales representative, I enjoyed coming to work everyday and always left feeling tired but happy. there really was no typical day when i worked there, everyday was different, and usually interesting, there won't every be a lack of something to do or someone needing help. Management was pretty good, although, most f the time it was hard to raech the managers whenever you were coming lat eof were requesting a change in schedule times (not often necessary). The hardest part of the job was probaby trying to deal with customers that didn't know what they were doing but seemed to knwo the wrong product or technique for the job, while this didnt happen often for me it was frustrating at times. the best part of the job was finding and meeting different people and being able to help them with the different problems that they faced, it was always interesting how different projects and needs seemed to come through the door."
good,Don't expect to get rich working at Home Depot.  Great place to work if you know about construction or any building trade.  Great part time or retirement job but you can't really make a good living at the job.. The pay is very low.
good,I was a cashier at Home Depot. I helped with costumer orders and checking out their items. I helped customers find things they needed in the store and kept my area tidy and neat. I learned a lot about customer service. The hardest part about the job was not having a set schedule.
good,Managers are easy to get along with and understanding. Quick to help if you should have any problem understanding what needs to be done. Open to new ideas and opinions (positive or negative).
good,The Home Depot is a great work environment where you will always find someone to assist with their projects. You can learn new skills that you may need for projects of your own also.
good,Home Depot was one of the best companies i have ever worked for.I learned a lot about customer service and how to treat my assoc as i go forward with my career.They really preach happiness in the work place and they believe in equality.
good,"This job was one of my best job ever,talking about the people everybody was helpful and you get ur hours and more...mr.mike was the head man talking about a understanding man..."
good,"High paced workplace that requires you to learn and apply the training you receive, flexible scheduling, ability to grow within company, ability to be awarded with full time position, understaffed"
good,"Great company to work, I work sales associate in Home Depot, this job made me learn many things such as driving machines,customer service, the perfect way to treat a customer, and etc"
good,"As a cashier i would tend to the customers and help out the stockers  bring in the shopping carts when needed, I would also work the sales floor and help others stock their areas when needed."
good,Worked at HD for 3 years a great place to work if you want a fast pace to work at.  Staff and everyone was very friendly. I would recommend this job for anyone who is looking for a side job while going to school or if you have other obligations.
good,Each day was something new or different for me right from the start. I was taught by awesome people how and what to keep in each aisle. Each manager was cool and helpful to me making sure I was improving. I enjoyed the diversity we had and everyone helped each other getting the job done the right but safe way. The hardest part to me was dealing with customers preparing myself to face them daily and make sure they were being taken care of. what I really enjoyed about the job was that I learned how to operate the machinery to move freight and it was a big step for me.
good,"Great job, especially if you are looking for something part time and work around your schedule. They offer good benefits, but seniority is a great problem there."
good,"I loved how they approved of me having mondays and tuesdays off so i could be with my nephew, but I hated being promised to move up and it never happening"
good,"Home Depot was a great place to work, however if you didn't understand what you were selling it would make it harder. However they do make the training available to you if you ask"
good,Home Depot has been a great company to work for with a lot of positive attributes to the company. They have some of the best benefits  available foe employee's. Their promotion availability is very good for anyone wanting to advance in the company. I managed from 3 to 9 people while at Home Depot daily on manage product stock and customer service. I have learned volumes in retail and customer service and the importance of both balancing. The hardest part of the job would be to always have a smile on ones face even though your not having a good day.  Best thing about Home Depot is when you help customers on projects and they come back and thank you for the advice and show pictures of their accomplishments.
good,"Management was hands down the best that I have ever experienced. Every manager was genuinely kind, friendly and happy to help with whatever the situation was. Working for the Home Depot has many benefits like tuition reimbursement (for only certain programs, which is why I have decided to resign as it does no reimburse my program and does not coincide with my busy class and study schedule), also Home Depot offers a great health and benefit plan. My only reason of leaving is that they cannot provide the amount of hours that I need in order to survive as a student. It is truly the best place you can work at and I 10/10 recommend it."
good,"Lots of learning to be done, encouragement for advancement. The only issue is you have to play into politics of management. It doesn't matter if you might be the best for the job, its if the manager wants you to work that job."
good,"I''ve been at The Home Depot for 16.5 years as a part-time cashier.  It's a great place to work.  I love being able to wear jeans and tennis shoes to work.  I'm not too fond of the collar shirt rule, however.  There is lots of flexibility with the scheduling with part-time employees, but not so much with full-time employees."
good,"Strong company culture, with great people and management. Working for Home Depot MET , the wage is average but that compensates for work like balance due no weekend or night shifts, strictly 6:00am-2:30pm."
good,Home Depot was very laid back job for me. No body bothers me I just come to do my job. Management don't care but they always keep eye on you. The money is not good but their other benefit is pretty awesome.
good,Todo el personal trabaja con los valores que fomenta la empresa y los refleja con el trato directo de clientes y asociados
good,Too many managers with limited people skills and lack of opportunities for advancement for older workers.  Work time changed in last few months and people with families are penalized.
good,"The home depot rapid distribution center is a great place to work for, very flexible with your schedule. All around a  good place with friendly people."
good,"Friendly environment, great teamwork, positive attitudes, management is very devoted to their associates and to follow their policies. The workplace is very well-kept, modest and respectful at all times."
good,"Home Depot is a wonderful company to work for. The management team are great to work with, and they ensure that your well-being at the job is safe. The workplace culture is very diverse and full of different personalities. The hardest part about the job would probably being on your feet all day if you are not used to that type of job. Above all my favorite is meeting and working with new people everyday."
good,This company is very understanding about hours and they also treat their employees very well. Good benefits and pay is good for a college student. This job as taught me how to be more sociable and communicate better with people I do not know i.e.:customers.
good,Fast pace environment. Train you very well for the job. Very good at trying to keep an upbeat happy work environment. Hardest part would be having to deal with things that are out of your control and having to find a way to resolve them with in their company policy.
good,I love this company. i had a great experience working at the home depot. Many opportunities for growth. Some slow coming but very very possible for any associate. . Thumbs up!
good,great place for kids to start to earn a good work ethic. Management is constantly promoting and advising of educational tools that can be achieve to reach goals .
good,"typical day of work- was managing a team of associates to make each department profitable."
good,"Customer service is a priority to The Home Depot although during my tenure at several of the stores, I felt they were losing their focus of the customer and more of a focus of numbers. Staffing the different departments became more of a challenge because of hours which resulted in associates covering departments that they weren't familiar with resulting in unsatisfied customers."
good,"I enjoy working for the home depot. The culture is relaxed and friendly. The people I work with are very easy to talk to. Currently, I am learning more of the management side of things to open my options to advance with the company."
good,Within a few weeks of working at The Home Depot I made many friends and learned most of what was necessary to succeed at my job. The online courses were very simple and quick and I had many chances to socialize while servicing most customers.
good,"Flooring sale and Appliance sales. Full time ,Great hours. They closed the store is the only reason I left working for the Home Depot"
good,Organize freight and stock the selves with products. Assist customers to find products or help solve problems. Working with the other staff was enjoyable.
good,"I have been here for a year. Overall, its been a great experience.I love my co-workers, I have fun, and it really feels like a tight group of people. However, I do have to complain about my ability to advance as I have voiced the fact I want to work on the sales floor. I have been trained in two different departments, but because, unfortunately, the department i'm currently in cant afford to lose an experienced worker, I am unable to. It feels like I am stuck. great people, management is very understanding of life events, and its easy to request off time. part-time benefits, 401k, tuition reimbursement, the whole 9 yards."
good,I've been happier with my job at Home Depot than any the job I've ever had. I enjoy my work in the Garden department as well as the time I spend as cashier. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers.
good,"I was a cashier there but was able to do many tasks, so it never got boring. I loved being outside in garden, and there were breaks every two hours to break the day up nicely"
good,"Fun work place, enjoyable co workers, only problem was my hours got a huge cut during winter. Management had some issues but nothing too big. I learned how to operate lifts and make sales to customers at Home Depot."
good,"Es una gran empresa para trabajar, el sueldo es bueno y dan facilidad para promocionarse si el empleado así lo desea, se aprende muy rápido gracias a los compañeros que son muy atentos y dispuestos a ayudar en todo, la gerencia es atenta con sus empleados y clientes, siempre en busca de un buen servicio, el trabajo no es complicado, un muy buen lugar para trabajar."
good,"Large focus on customer service, but with the training provided, it was no problem. Had to take paint orders and recommend products."
good,"Nothing special here. Just helping customers find the products they need, and filled paint orders. Training on products made it easy to understand what the customers need and what will work best for them."
good,"Dynamic company. Always on the leading edge in the home improvement market place."
good,"THD is a wonderful company and culture.  There is ample room for advancement and a strong leadership team.  If you are serious about working hard and enjoying the benefits & rewards associated with working hard, THD is your company.  The company provides support and a structured leadership development program, as well as tuition reimbursement.  In addition, the leadership team provides opportunities for exposure and growth."
good,Meet with company management to pick up remodel plan and materials to do so. Travel to meet customers at their home. Review project and produce high quality room transformation. Hands on working and supervising to final completion.
good,Home Depot is a great company to work for. There are plenty of advancement opportunities and you are likely to find your fit in any of the departments.
good,"It is a hard job at times but the co-workers are very nice and helpful.  Everyone works together!  They have excellent benefits, but you have to have a certain amount of hours to get them.  Part-time workers hours were cut to 10 hours a week."
good,Home Depot is a great place to work.  Everyone is very friendly and easy to work with.  Only downfall is they don't have many full time positions.  If a part time job is enough for you to work it is great but if you are wanting full time you better look somewhere else.
good,Typical work day was great especially if you learn to drive everything and you learn about every department. I learned more than I thought I could about tools and hardware. Coworker were amazing to work with and be around. The hardest part for me was being afraid of heights a little bit. Most enjoyable thing was being at work.
good,Had a great knowledge of construction products which my customers appreciate so I could point them in the right direction...was very quick at managing customer orders to safely get them on their way
good,"I loved my experiences at The Home Depot in Saugus, MA, and I have to say I became very knowledgeable in several departments throughout the store. The biggest thing I got out of my employment there was the relationships I built, and the experience in deep active Customer Service. I recommend the retail positions offered at The Home Depot to any beginner in that particular field."
good,"This job has been on of the best jobs I've had. They motivate you to keep pursuing your career there or at another place. The people are all nice,I hardly come home with a bad day at work. Some customers do make your day bad though."
good,"There's just enough to do, although some days I wish it were more staffed than others. Supervisors keep us in check, and we usually complete our projects before closing."
good,Typical job duties are checking out customers and straightening display areas around the cash registers.  Enjoyable interaction with customers and co-workers.  I've relearned cashiering duties from previous jobs.
good,The people here are all really nice and the management is the best I have ever had in my work experience so far. You learn a lot about yourself and about other useful information for your everyday life working here.
good,It's a fast paced company there is always that has to be done. Customer service is our top priority. Plus the benefits that you receive are some of the best anywhere.
good,"Home Depot is a great company. In my three years working with them, I have achieved several honors and rewards. I enjoy working for this company, especially the customer service aspect. The hardest part of my current position is the fact that it is very repetitive. I definitely enjoy the schedule at my job."

good,"Typical warehouse job, fast paced,great coworkers. Good stable job to have, operated forklift, reach, clamp, electric pallet jack. just seeing what else is out there currently"
good,"All employees are recognized and appreciated. Fun, encouraging environment to work in. The supervisors seem to care about the safety and well being of the customers and the employees.  the pay is not that great but the company has many incentives for the employees and there is room for advancement within the company."
good,"I loved working here and they had the best benefits to offer. A typical work day wasn't so typical because there was always a variety of different tasks to do. I was so knowledgeable in other departments that I would float around and help others out.The managers were always so nice and helpful. There was really nothing hard about the job. If I had to label one thing being hard, it would most likely have to be when we had call offs. But I would typically figure things out quickly so it wouldn't be so difficult. I loved coming in and working in the various departments and I enjoyed having fun with my co-workers/management."
good,This is a great company they really do care about their employees this was a second job for me and I. Hard a hard time deciding on which one to let go. Unfortunately it was hd but if I had to do it again I would choose this company. I was making twice as much at my other job but no benefits and I had been in that field awhile and was ready for a change but couldn't pass up the cash but in the long term hd would have been better for my future.
good,"If ever in need of learning about how to DIY a project, this would be my go-to place. Well knowledged staff in each department, with abundance of willingness to help get answers for customers and employees alike."
good,"I enjoyed working there, but the management could have been better. The work environment was pretty relaxing, but some of the workers were laid back, which caused trouble for some of the customers. Other than that, I don't have any more complaints."

good,"One of the best places I have worked,  If your a people person and like to help others, then this is the place for you.  But  sometimes you be working  a closing shift then an opening shift , which gets kinda if frustrating at times."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with customers and the gratification of knowing you've helped make someone's day and complete a task.
good,I really enjoyed working with The Home Depot. From working within the The Home Depot I was able to learn many new skills that would prepare me for the role of Manager. I was able to make schedules and deal with any customer care issue that I would come across as a Customer Service Representative.
good,Well working at the home depo everyone becomes family with you And you can always ask for help and learn new things in the store or new things to do
good,"Chez Home Depot, la culture d'entreprise est définie et elle est forte.

good,"I typically will down-stock items from the overhead onto the shelves. I have learned a lot from Home Depot, most predominantly getting a chance to get certified to work lift trucks. The management is excellent, they try to take care of the employees to the best of their ability. The coworkers are generally very pleasant to be around."
good,great company to work for. They care about their employees and offer great benefit. Offer great 401k and are very informative
good,Definitely learn a lot. Many open doors to move up if you express your interest. Very lenient when it comes to availability. The benefits that are provided if you're thinking of staying long term are actually really good. Management can sometimes be a hit or miss. Managers that have grown within the company are very helpful and guide you generally through your adjustment period.
good,Retiring looking for something different on a part time basis. I would recommend anyone looking for full time work with a company that cares to go to home depot and live the orange life
good,"A typical day at work involves helping customers, unloading trucks of freight, getting said freight to the sales floor and packing it on shelves. I learned how to operate several types of machinery, such as forklifts, panel saws, and carpet cutters. Management are very friendly and accommodating. Co-workers generally maintain an upbeat attitude and are usually friendly and approachable. The hardest and most enjoyable part of my job is unloading trucks of freight with a forklift."
good,Great company to work for. Everyone is great. The management treats everyone well. I truly like everyone I work with. We all try to enjoy what we do in the store.
good,"Great place to work, great people to work for, a wide variety of work disciplines to learn and grow in. If your looking for a rewarding job in the building products field, I would definitely recommend the Home Depot!"
good,"A typical day at Home Depot is always productive for me. I always down stock product that isn't presently stocked on the shelf, I help any and all customers that are in my aisle or are near my aisle. Before my shift ends I walk my aisle making sure everything is clean and all the products are properly aligned on the shelf."
good,"I worked here over a decade ago when I was a teenager, man was it an amazing job. I learned a LOT from it, some of which I still use to this day. It gave me a huge appreciation for retail in general and taught me many customer service techniques. For a kid fresh out of high school the money was really great and the people were amazing"
good,"Rewarding entry-level positions, well-managed, experienced associates, and clear customer service mission. Very flexible work hours for part-time employees, and lenient with leave-of-absence lengths for college attendance."
good,"My employment at the Home Depot as a cashier was overall a good one. The employees were all kind and friendly, and the experience gained from working helps you improve your character and skills with people and technology. However, the biggest downside is that the scheduling can be pretty thin during the worst times, and so I often found myself swamped with customers and little to no help."
good,"Love that this company hires a wide variety of employees with different ages, ethnicity, beliefs and backgrounds"
good,"I enjoy every day at work, the colleagues are all fantastic insofar as the way they treat each other. The management team listen to employees complaints and try their best to change things, the main bonne of contention is the salary, which, according to many co worker and i is low as compare to the competitors."
good,Home Depot is a good company to work for. They take care of their employees and have a great recognition program.
good,Working at the Home Depot (HD) for the past 6 years gave me the experience I needed to pursued my dreams as a law enforcement officer. One of the things that I enjoy the most as an asset protection specialist for HD is that I was able to conduct sales floor surveillance in plain clothes security and identify potential shoplifters in the building. This allowed me to make citizen's arrest and document my cases to local law enforcement about the incident. Building a good relationship with officers that I was fortunate to meet was one thing that I enjoy as well.
good,"The job was easy, the people you work with are nice for the most part. you get breaks and lunches. They keep you on your toes but thats what helps the day go by. Overall nice place to work."
good,The people who work at Home Depot are usually upbeat and happy people. The work environment is usually a great. The benefits are awesome and there is always an opportunity to learn something new from how to build something to home improvement classes.
good,everyday work is a good day no matter if its a lot of work or hard work because of the kind of co worker around you makes it gret all the time. Everyone checks on each other as a team.
good,Typical day is peaceful getting shelves and products organized that where misplaced or out of place from customers throughout the day. After the store would close and I would bring skids out with a electric pallet jack. Break the pallets down organize them to be taken by my co-workers to the right department. I learned good customer service skills. I learned some leadership skills and also good work ethic. The hardest part was being able to go to sleep after I get off at 12a.m. The most enjoyable part was being able to drive forklifts and other equipment to get the job down.
good,"poor management that does not want to be there, was grabbed once by a manager to be reprimanded, if you are a woman that is good looking yo have better chances for advancement than any other person there."
good,"I enjoy cashing out customers at the Home Depot. Being fast and accurate while I ensure the customers shopping experience was excellent is part of providing superb customer service at the Home Depot. Keeping a clean and well stocked area is another aspect of working the front end. Asking the customer if they found everything they needed and if not, trying to problem solve their situation demands quick thinking and action."
good,"usual day is very busy"
good,"The job was fun, very enjoyable. The people where nice and very informative. The work was pretty easy in my opinion. All in All good place to work if you want to settle down."
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for in terms of health benefits, 401K, Stock purchase, employee discounts thru outside company, PTO, vacation, paid holidays, education reimbursement, innovative products."
good,its a great company that treats their employees very well. the hardest part of the job is having to move very quickly to get the task done.
good,"A typical day would start by me going into work by 7:00 Pm. I would assist the manager help up the conveyer belt to prepare to unload the truck. I helped unload the 20,000-25,000 thousand packages off the truck, then spent the next 8 hours of the night putting away all the products. Then eventually if everything got done, we'd get off about 5:00 AM."
good,"i love the home depot i just think they need to pay better and equal "
good,This was an enjoyable job as it kept me active and there was always something to do. The other employees were very easy to work with.
good,"Todos los días son diferentes, siempre buscas como animar al asociado a ser ""Feliz"" para que de un excelente servicio al cliente."
good,Typical day at work included going over our checklist for the department. More often then not the person in front of you (whether this be closing the night before or the early morning person) had not done much off this list. There were many days I had to sign papers because I would close the store and put away semi's until after midnight and be back in at 4am to unload drywall or another truck. The amount of extra work our department required was not compensated for and it didn't always feel like people wanted to be there. The hardest part of the job was staying upbeat during the day with so many negative energy sources around me. I found the most enjoyable part of my day was loading and unloading semi's. I was fairly quick at it and it was typically outside the store which was refreshing.
good,I love fast paced work as well as the challanges it brings with it.To coplete something is such a great feeling and to be rewarded with working with great people is even better.Working a honest days work and receiving an honest days pay is my life.
good,"I believe that working at Home Depot has been a great experience. i learned how to adapt to a new working environment that I wasn't familiar with, I learned how to interact with new people and one of the key assets that I would say that I learned is how  to deal with difficult customers. On a daily basis, I get to work with great coworkers, some of which I have befriended."
good,"amazing place to work, diverse workplace, people are always helpful and down to earth no matter which position they work at."
good,"The Home Depot has exceptional employees. Management goes out of its way to help associates maximize their potential,"
good,"Moderate paced on your feet job with lot's of customer service interaction.  "
good,"The Home Depot is an easy work location.  The work is not overly complicated and the staff is also easy to get along with.  The job does require a lot of standing and walking. Benefits are available and the company has a support system to aid employees if they should experience severe life challenges.  Overall, I would definitely recommend The Home Depot to others, good company."
good,"J'aime bien travailler chez Home-Dépôt. L'esprit d'équipe est bien présente et le personnel est très acceuillant. J'ai appris beaucoup sur les portes et fenêtres puisque c'est dans ce departement que je travail. J'ai aussi appris sur tout ce qui touche le domaine puisque j'ai eu à travailler un peu partout dans le magasin. En somme, c'est un bon environnement de travail et je le recommande pour tout étudiant qui se cherche un emploi à temps partiel."
good,"-Primero que nada tenemos unos minutos de junta en equipo para tocar temas del mejoramiento de la tienda"
good,Home depot took time to train each of us and on the second day i was off on my own ready to do things on my own. they never left you there unless they knew you were okay and they would always check to make sure everything was going smooth. If you ever messed up the managers would help you correct your mistake and show you the correct way. Very positive work environment would not hesitate to work there again
good,"I love working for The Home Depot. Its very busy but the environment is great. We work hard but we also have a lot of fun. I love the company because they have a set of core values that they actual live by. They company gives back to the communities and have several programs in place where we help local veterans. They do a kids workshop every first Saturday of the month and the kids really enjoy being builders for the few hours. The advancement opportunities at Home Depot are endless. If you put the drive into getting promoted, you will. Overall I really enjoy this place."
good,"Great place in terms of fellow staff and management.  I found even if you come late as long as you give notice your going to be late there is no ""grief"" like you may get and have gotten at other jobs."
good,"what i like about the job, is that they did not put you in a dept in the store with out the proper training."
good,"Wonderful culture, atmosphere, associates, programs, etc. Great learning environment. Good start up job, perfect for any age and hobbies."
good,"good place to work. Happy co-workers. Good chance to earn bonus on paychecks. Difficult to advance within company. Learned a lot about building and fixing homes. used power tools, and built large displays"
good,"Can only speak of my current location but overall it has been a pleasant experience. Management is decent and they are very flexible with part timer's hours. Full timers have a bit less flexibility. You will either work a beginning shift, mid(If 3 full timers in your department) or closing. Times rarely vary. Good if you're a opener or mid shift but you may not like it if you get chosen to close(hard to work life around as it starts right in the middle of the day around 12/1). You will have to do an interview every time their is a new position open, even if its in your department(ex. Closer interviewing for an opening position in same department). Aside from that it is not bad. Great benefits and job security. Lots of room for advancement."
good,"My experience at The Home Depot was excellent.  While the company was #13 on Fortune's list, and had thousands of employees working at its Store Support Center the company culture was that of a small town.  People working together to accomplish great things!"
good,"Typical day at work included selling hardware to customers and stocking product."
good,Employees are easy to work with and managers are easy to get along with. The hardest part about the job is moving large and/or heavy items.
good,Your team is your best tool. The job position in it self is cool but can get boring . On the MET team there isn't much room to grow unless you move to store side.
good,"What can I say, I learned a lot working here part time. Employees and management wanted you to succeed in the work place and were very willing to help out and teach to help you advance to other positions. The only reason I rated pay low was because I was a part time worker so I didnt make much. That is the only complaint I really have. Only reason I did not continue with this company was due to school."
good,"I've learned a lot from working at Home Depot. I learned how to multi task, assisting customers, and learned new items around the store from tools, to plumbing. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting the customers. They were nice and respectful and never gave me a hard time."
good,"it is a good company that provides employees the opportunity to grow base on the individual abilities."
good,"Sales associates provide fast, friendly service by actively seeking out customers to assess their needs and provide"
good,I enjoyed learning new things daily for example data entry and filing paperwork and also helping me building self-confidence.
good,Friendly Environment to work at. Management always tried to keep us eager to learn about the products we offer and how to help our customers. Training was fun and useful.
good,"At work I pull orders and get items that the customer bought, i learn where the products are throughout the store."
good,assisted customers i learned a lot about plumbing and the people were great management was wonderful i problem solved most of the time
good,"The warehouse is divided into 3 departments. Inbound, Processing, and Outbound. We get trucks with freight from our vendors through the Inbound department where it is received then put into a staging area. The processing department then process the freight and takes the full pallets to the outbound department where it is shipped off to the stores."
good,My coworkers were always very kind and friendly. Management could be a bit demanding at times but for the most part was great to work with. The company truly does have it's own culture and really does believe in including all of it's employees.
good,This is a great student job. The hours are flexible and there are many departments to move around in. The company continuously trains its employees on how to offer superior customer service in order to gain customer loyalty.
good,"They give okay training, the main thing you will be doing is showing customers where to look for the part they need. It can be frustrating when you are getting calls when people are waiting on you because the department is understaffed. Other than that, the people that work there are helpful and go out of their way to do what they can."
good,"stocking merchandise. Customer self services.."
good,didn't work here long but I didn't have a problem with this place at all.i was looking for a job to get on my feet with and the staff along with the co-workers made me feel apart of the team really fast.i worked overnights and those went fast.good and bad thing because there wasn't a great deal of hours but you weren't up all night.the work was simple and straight forward.i think the hardest part for me was the commute but I did it.
good,"I was a lumber salesman, I would help customers with their projects and cut lumber for their needs."
good,Home depot is a great company to work for it my not be perfect but its a good stepping stone to carry you over to your career if i could i will continue to work for home depot as long as i could with hopes of advances on unto management positions
good,"A typical day at work for me consists of returning items for customers and making sure they are satisfied with their returns. The managers work hard at keeping the store neat, and making sure that all departments are clear of markdowns. There are a wide range of diverse associates at Home Depot."
good,"The Home Depot is a great company to work for with competitive benefit packages available. I've had my good and bad managers, but mostly they are awesome. There is a family/ team culture they try to cultivate so everyone is happy to be at work and productive."

good,I enjoyed working at home depot. The only disadvantage is bad scheduling.  Other than that it is a great company to work for.
good,A Typical day at work was for me to stand and wait for customers and make sure the customer has everything they needed.. My co workers were prettycool my managers were always busy so we barley get to speak but overall it was an ok job.

good,"Its a good company to work part time, the management there is great and respectful."

good,"I really enjoyed my job at The Home Depot. The people were great, the work was great, there was a lot to learn, and if I had not had to leave, I would still be enjoying my employment there."
good,"A typical day at the Depot begins as soon as you get out of the car. You greet everyone on the way to clock in. You interact with the associate before you to catch up on notes and issues. Check the schedule to verify that there is enough people to help with customers."
good,"pretty straight forward job."
good,"the typical day at work is productive, lots of energy is used to greet customers with a smile and friendly manner. Management is great very honorable to employees such as given awards and recognition learned how many customer service skills throughout the time being there."
good,"As a cashier, the typical work day consists of clocking in and checking in with head cashier to be assigned to a register. While on the job, cashiers would review job performance from the previous week to establish goals and areas that needed to be improved upon. Any quizzes or classes that need to be taken online to maintain up-to-date knowledge of Home Depot and their values, safety standards, customer satisfaction protocol, etc... were reviewed. The fellow co-workers were very enjoyable to work with which made the pressure of maintaining excellent job performance less stressful and easy to obtain. The management did a good (rather than excellent) job keeping order within Home Depot, however the availability of the management team and of certain co-workers were not satisfactory on most days. The hardest part of the job would be getting any help from co-workers that were not of the same department. For example, answering a customer's question about a certain product took awhile if the product was associated with the electrical or hardware department (this would require calling a co-worker from said department). Most enjoyable part of the job were the holiday parties and picnics as well as the events every other Friday that were made up by management."
good,A typical day at Home Depot would include standing at the end of my register looking for customers that need to check out or help customers find what they are looking for. I've learned good customer service is very important no matter what. We have good managers that know what they are doing and put customers first at all times. My co-workers are the easiest to get along with and are all very nice and making working at Home Depot fun. The most enjoyable part of my day is being around my co-workers and seeing happy customers.

good,"Management is friendly; they get to know you which is great. You're not just another employee in a sea of faces"
good,Home Depot was a fun place to work as long as you don't consider advancing. They severely take advantage of you quickly.
good,"A typical day starts with making sure I clock in on time, "
good,The work place enviroment is friendly and inviting. Everyone seems t enjoy there job.
good,Working for the Highway Department at the time was a secure job but it was hard for women to move up. It was still a good old boy environment..
good,"muy buena empresa llegar y surtir los puntos de venta."
good,"while empoloyeed it was my delight to learn new skills while helping other to learn what I had already come to add to my skills. Fork  truck operator (sit down, and stand up). Bob cat operator, wielding. Plumbing construction, janitor. Over all I am a fast learner and not afraid to work."

The management team are amazing and the culture their is alive and well. I have learned so much working for The Home Depot. My co-workers are positive and very driven by sales. It's a pleasure to work there.
good,"It was a delight working at Home Depot.  You are welcomed to work every day and in the two summers that I worked there, it was clear to see that people treated each other as if we were a family.  The hardest part of working at Home Depot was working out in the stone-yard in the hot summer days.  We were supplied with water and the proper safety procedures to ensure that it was still a safe working environment and a safe shopping environment.  I would definitively recommend working at Home Depot if you want to improve your teamwork skills, improve your confidence when speaking with strangers as well as learn some useful DIY (Do It Yourself) tips and tools that will be useful in the future."
good,Was a cashier then moved to paint within six months. Loved the hours and flexible schedules to work around school. Could support your family off this income. Was going through domestic relationship which the manager wanted nothing to do with so I left for my own safety.

good,"The Home Depot is one of the best retail giants that there is to work for. That being said, like any retail place, after a while you just get burned out. The benefits are great if you work long enough for the success sharing that they put on, and there is plenty of access to medical plans."
good,"A typical day as a Home Depot escalation supervisor consisted of going through a list of assigned tickets. The tickets would contain issues pertaining to the website and website orders. I would go through the tickets, look them up in the dashboard, do my best to work a solution for these customers. I learned plenty about customer service along with much about myself. These customers were typically not happy with the responses from our policy and procedures, and would become irate. However, with this I learned that the best way to serve the customer is to detach however still show empathy and be able to help. The hardest part of the day would be meeting the deadlines of many of these tickets, because so many would come in and need to be worked as soon as they possibly could. I did enjoy the job from meeting the great people, and being able to get such great reactions from customers when I am able to help. Just knowing I made a difference in their life was really enlightening."

I started at Home Depot as a cashier was promoted to a Manager position in a year, I started when i was 20 years old and saw it as a job that paid my bills now almost 10 years later I see it as the best experience of my life.

good,Great place to work. lots of good people who were willing to help out whenever you had a question. excellent tuition programs for students and benefits are great.

good,worked in lumber help people clean floor at night when done work
good,"Night shift at Home Depot was fun, I met some really cool people.. Most nights we would work from 9pm to 1am and tuesdays 9pm to 530am. Working freight is a really easy job once you get the hang of it... Hard and fast work, but its really fun along the way. Typically we would get an RDC cart for each department in the store full of boxes to be stocked, along with pallets to work as well. Sometimes getting as much as 50 pallets a night done. The nights we didnt get really any freight we would usually get cut for the night or packdown (downstock) merchandise. Our supervisor communicated with us alot through out the night through our first phones telling us what stuff to get done and just general duties. Depending on if ur hired on as a permenent you got alot of machine experience such as, electric pallet jack, Forklift, Reach truck, Slip sheet, and the Order Picker.  Co Workers are usually really cool too. There was about 6 people on our freight team. The Managers at store #4725 are really nice also.. you only really see them for about an hour until the store closes. At the night of the night we would have all of our card board and trash gathered up in carts and have one person work all of it in receiving while everyone else continued on freight, up-stocking or sweeping and cleaning up the store."
good,"Work is nice and easy as a cashier, there's a lot of opportunity for advancement."
good,"Overall its not at all bad place to work. It will depend on your supervisor if you have a knowledgeable, caring and sincere supervisor, you will love to go to the job. Unfortunately, it can be worst too, if you dont have a very good supervisor who just does not have any clue of he or she is doing."
good,"So far, I don't have any typical day at work . but I learned so much from this this job and management team is really so cooperating with everybody in the store."

The store management works incredibly well with the associates to make the stores successful. Associates know and care about the products and helping the new associates grow into the role and gain knowledge. Wonderful atmosphere.
good,"working for The Home Depot really got me started in Asset Protection, and I fell in love with the position ever since. A typical day of work consisted of reviewing CCTV footage of the previous day or night,reviewing cash shortages, investigating security protocols or breaches, I have to say with so much responsibility given to me at The Home Depot it really gets you ready for the next step up in your career. I had some amazing people that I worked alongside, they really made the job enjoyable and certainly made my job a whole lot easier as a result. The most enjoyable part of the job was apprehending shoplifters and prosecuting them, for me that was the highlight of the job."
good,"I started at Home Depot with very basic skills for fixing a house or doing ANY type of home repair/remodeling. Now, I have laid vinyl plank floors, tiled walls, changed fixtures, etc.! I wish I still had this job."
good,"Fun place to work. Extremely caring management. All in all, great place to start a career"
good,"Typical day at work started six in the morning, Each day we had a informal meeting about what it was we are going to be accomplishing today and continuing on working goals. Most the day spent with moderate supervision gave supervision organizing and situating merchandise displays in the store. Coworkers and employers overall had an excellent deposit about you. I really miss the experience with them. Messenger will Parthage be the project from now to come together and build as a team. Also enjoyed working on the computer system to navigate the different diagrams to follow."
good,"The Home Depot RDC compiles a collection of talent from many industries to build a culture based on values, teamwork, and customer service.

good,"My job is pretty laid back. I help customers who are looking to have installations done by Home Services. Also, help the associates enter any leads they have gotten into the system. During slow times I work in any department that may need help with customers or putting up freight. "
good,"mucha comunicación entre compañeros,  buen servicio, aprendí mucho de mis compañeros. aprendí muchas cosas sobre el servio al cliente.mis horarios variables,"
good,Nice helping customers solve their problems.  Lots of team problem solving.
good,"During my previous experiences in this field, I have developed strong skills to provide high-level management support by carrying out research, handle client requests, and carry out other managerial functions. In addition, I have a demonstrated the ability to train and supervise lower-level mentoring staff."
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for, all employees are very easy to get along with and the customer interactions are usually very enjoyable.As with any job there is always the occasional difficult customer, but there is always another employee close by that's willing to step in and help with any issues that were unable to be resolved by the cashier alone. There is always something going on just for store employees and management is always very good about going the extra mile to make sure that all lower level employees are able to participate."
good,"A general day was fantastic. I love paint yet would work wherever I was needed. However, those good ole' days at the paint pit were the best days of my work life ever. I was schooled in so many perspectives, had a joy workings interacting with the local work force. The hardest part for me was not being able to work or know hands on people at the top of home depot's chain, (corporate) to show my worth over life issues and ethics. Only the coworkers knew what home depot meant to me. Anotther chapter in my life now."
good,"I maintained collaborative relationships with the store manager, three assistant managers and fellow employees to achieve a harmonious and productive work environment. "

good,"The Home Depot creates a working environment that makes employees want to work and enjoy it too. They show the most appreciation for individual and team performances. Hardest part of the job is that it's repetitive. Co-workers are the most loving bunch and works on bringing each other up. The managers work with everyone, on an individual basis, to help boost their performance. The Home Depot's main philosophy is SAFETY, and boy do they show it! Safety incentives galore, paid warm-up/stretch times and even a gym."
good,"Hard work on hard floors in steel toes. Lots of customers, high expectations, most excellent fellow team members."

good,"fun place to work for. Very fast paced. Learned the values of our employees and customers. Learned how to manage inventory and cash handling more. Manage time better. People I work with are friendly. The hardest part of the job is trying to learn new techniques and to remember them, and when it becomes extremely busy and knowing to multi task between customers and duties. Enjoyable part of the job is getting the job done, staying busy, and to be able to satisfy the company as well as our customers."
good,Confidencial con respecto a mi actividad por el puesto desempenado

The same issues that you will dislike in any job will be contributed here as well. On the other note, If you're a hardworker and willing to put in the man power and the hours you can advance in this corporation."
good,Home Depot is a great secure company to work for.  It is the type of company that welcomes individual ideas.
good,"My days working at homedepot always started in the evening time because that's when most supervisors was scheduled. When i arrive for my shift i always checked the schedule to see what associates i managed in my dept ( Flooring ) was working for day so i can write their daily work list. Everyday as a supervisor i had do daily inventory on products that was High selling or wasn't selling at all to see if their was any theft or something i can do to capture 100% Sales. On Wednesdays all management had to meet sharp at 3pm to go over weekly sales and upcoming promos that we had to set for that night. That was the only day that i talked to management about internal issues with staff but if anything popped up, management was always their to help. The hardest part of my job was staying on top of paper work which sometimes became over whelming because you still had to manage staff , Help Customers ect. The most enjoying part working at homedepot was being able to work with co-workers to accomplish goals and get task done in short amount of time."
good,"As the department Manager I was over HR as well therefore I was in control over the following:"
good,"ringing up customers, helping customers locate items they are looking for."
good,Good place to work but dont expect a lot of hours if you start as cashier.
good,"A great job to have, I loved it and I learned a lot from working there. Awesome employees and the managers were also easy going and down to earth. I thought it was a really great company to work for while in school."
good,"Company provided excellent opportunity with good wages and benefits. Got to know labor,safety and inventory control standards required by company and governments. Good training and incentives/rewards.. Shortage of staff was frustrating if one had to cover other departments ."
good,not a bad place to work I like helping customers so its right up my alley. However I wish they could place me in electrical or plumbing I am in flooring and have let them know I could sell way more else where.
good,"Most days I was a cashier, until I was asked to be the temporary lead generator only three months after I started. Then I was moved to the service desk. "
good,Good place to work. Management will work with you according to your availability.  Opportunities for continued career advancement.
good,I currently work part time for Home Depot and I am looking for a full time Leadership position.

Managers and co-workers were very friendly.  The most enjoyable part of the job was our Mothers Day, Fathers Day and Christmas parties!  The hardest part of the job was to leave, because I moved to another city."
good,"""I put Customers first"" is the motto of Home Depot. A typical day would include processing payments, opening credit appliances, answering phone calls, special ordering merchandice, working reports, making calls to customers and vendors for the status of the merchandice and ringing up orders for customers. I have learned a lot about loss prevention. I have learned to be sure to check inside, between and under merchandice. The most enjoyable part of the job are the repeat customers that I have built relationships with. "
good,"When first getting to work i report to the head cashier for where they will be placing me. I may cover someone's break or lunch, or they will put me somewhere where I am needed. I could go to the pro-desk and check out guest's who are buying mostly lumber, or other building materials, the garden area, or the main end which is where most items are purchased. Since starting, I learned different types of lumber and how to measure appropriately, as well as how to look up all different types of SKU's. If there is an item brought up that does not have a UPC or SKU label on it, i must call the appropriate department and describe the item to them so they can provide me with a SKU. I must also do an overhead-page when needed, as well as balancing the till and sending up the cash in a pneumatic tube system when cash strip levels are reached. My co-workers are very enjoyable to work with and helpful. The hardest part of the job would probably be the sales aspect of the job, because i have a hard time getting customers to sign up for Home Depot credit cards because i dont want to feel like I am pushing the customers into something they might not want to do. But the overall most enjoyable part of the job would be meeting all kinds of different people and making them feel happy by the time they leave the store."
good,help coustomers find there mobile home parts and unload trucks for stock

Management was always respect to employees. The most  enjoyable part of my day there was knowing that my co-workers were working just as hard as me. One of the hardest things was when we were closing and a lot of the other associates went home and I didn't know much about a certain department and couldn't help them. 
good,"Management was incredibly flexible and treated you with respect. They were always available for you to ask questions and teach you new aspects about the job. On the first day, everyone was welcoming and warm; it was one of the best interpersonal work environments. The hardest part of the job was all of the lifting, cleaning and being around so much dust. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with so many unique people and being given the opportunity to shine without over-the-shoulder supervision. "

The manager tried to make sure he treated everyone fairly and granted time off as requested."
good,"I have been with the company for years, so my job tasks change depending on the need in certain departments. I have learned hands on skills, product knowledge, protocol/SOP. Management always changes about every two years. Co-workers are knowledgeable. The most enjoyable aspect of the job, is the feeling that everyone cares about the well being of the company and associates. I know how the store operations work, security and rapport."
good,"Well my typical day here is i come in a little early so I can get the feel of the enviroment to see if things are a little slow, chaotic, or mellow and i chat with my fellow employees for a little and we just get ready for whatever is ahead. I clock in and head to the bathroom and pin my hair up and make sure my clothes are together and not looking unappealing. Then I head to the cash register I am assigned to and I get things together and organized. Once I get my till and switch on my light thats when the fun begins! I enjoy it and I meet so many new people and see new faces almost everyday. Great place to work if you ask me."

good,"Great while it lasted... Fast paced, a lot of fun to work there. Great management."
good,"Each day is a new adventure. Never a dull moment, always busy. I learned teamwork and time management.

And it's really good to see that the people I worked with loved the same thing. Sometimes the work got pretty intense with work and inventory. But, that's part of the job and keeping the store counts correct and looking nice. I didn't mind that at all."

I enjoy been around all my co-worker and helping in any way that I can. It is an award on its own making customers smile and knowing that the customers are satisfied when they leave.

The most enjoyalbe part of my job is also working with customers, and helping them make educated decisions about their construction and remodeling needs. The Home Depot is a great company to work for, and has given me the customer service expierence I strive to enhance with future careers working with the civilian population."
good,"Lots of customer service, problem solving and multi tasking. The day goes by fast."
good,Home Depot is a great place if you are looking for few hours of work a week. Everyone working there is amazing and so friendly. It's very easy to get along with everyone and work as a team. The only problem is they cut a lot of hours every week and you don't know until that day that your hours may be cut so you really never know what your paycheck is going to look like every two weeks. I wish their schedule was a little more stable because I love everything else about them!
good,Working at Home Depot was great. Everyday is a new learning experience. Home Depot has taught me to be patient. Management was okay but I didn't have to see management much. Working there you have to get along with co-workers because its a team environment and if you don't get along the work wont get done the right way. There was nothing hard about the job if you knew what to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I helped a customer solve a problem and they come back and thank me.
good,working at cash register checking customer out.
good,I'm a cashier a home depot sometimes it can be hard sometimes it's hard
good,well its a great place to work i learned alt working at the depot i learned all kinds of tools even plants but mostly how to get along with other people management could be alot better but i guess u cant have it all lol my hardest part of my day is dealing with customers my most enjoyable part of my day is going home early lolco workers great
good,"All in all The Home Depot is a great place to work. Of course there are always a few bad apples in every store that can make your job a nightmare, but that is life. Typically you come into work and you hit the floor running. Your absolute concern is to make sure customers are taken care of, providing the best service you can. Other duties include cleaning up, stocking shelves, and anything else managers need of you."
good,"Home Depot realizes without the small hourly employees, the company wouldn't exist. And they act like it. Employees are respected, given good benefits, encouraged to fairly compete for promotions and raises and the environment is upbeat and friendly"

good,"They go a bit heavy on the safety and corporate politics. Too many company benefits, personally i would rather get a large paycheck. Other than that i have no complaints. Great atmosphere and people, decent pay, and flexible hours."
good,Very busy fun and Exciting workplace environment! Employees were always compensated for over achieving given bonuses parties and much more. Management was always very helpful!
good,Good company to work for. Management is friendly and understanding. Job duties can be strenuous and tedious but overall not that bad. Other associates are enjoyable to work with.
good,I was more than thankful to have such a well paying job that required very little effort after clocking out. It was easy to do my job and still have enough time to do homework.
good,My time here was brief (1 month) I left on my terms. The managers were great and supportive like my co workers. We work as a team for a common goal. Pay isnt that great but the benefits make up for that. Plus theres easy days and hard days so it's not bad at all. You get full time depending on your work ethic which is fair. You should move up relatively fast if you're a good worker.
good,"Flexibility, good managers, good communication between employee's and.stafg as well as management. Good training on hands and computer knowledge. Good support system."
good,"Working at the Home Depot was fun and very satisfying. Only thing that made it rough was not working more than 20 hours per week on a part time schedule. That made me not want to take it serious for a career. I have bills to pay at the end of every month, with their salary I would fall short sometimes."
good,Great place to work always room for advancement and management there is  one of the best I've worked for you show them you can work and want to they will help you succeed
good,The most important tool for the job what's a scan gun which wasn't always available but needed what is a job afpak down overall the job was a good experience a knowledgeable
good,"Great learning experience, learned a lot about flooring during my time there. Management is pretty good, and for the most part give you plenty of freedom to do your job"
good,"Great benefits, vacation, PTO, 2 yearly bonuses for associates. Worked from cashier to service desk to book keeping. Can protoe or transfer to different sites anywhere"
good,I overall learned about how to best help the customer to suit their needs and be a part of the customer service team. But also how to pick online and freight orders. I dealt with the fright scheduling and also loading up the flatbeds with the forklift. The most enjoyable part of my job was being the man who got stuff ready to go and making everything was running smoothly.
good,"Working at Home Depot was a great learning experience handling all computer systems, special orders, I was the heart of the store. It did provide me with warm people and i had a great time working for home depot. The associated were super helpfull all the time."
good,MET was a great experience compared to cashiering for home depot. In met you worked as a team and honestly the job wasn't hard. plus its way better having a set schedule than being called from a manager to come in five minutes before starting shift because of cashier shortage.
good,"Friendly people,have catered meals at monthly meetings,they reward team members if you meet company goals,nice atmosphere,management gives you a lot of respect for any issues that may arise,A great warehouse in Topeka Ks. To work at"
good,"I worked with many great people at Home Depot. There's always some bad apples, but honestly, there was too much positivity about walking in there that the negativity could be ignored. Customers were definitely jerks, so be prepared for that, but other than that, raises were definitely nice. I loved the reviews to see what I needed to fix in my performance, because I wanted to grow. I thought they were full of it when  they said it was like a big family there, but I soon realized I was wrong. Miss that place."
good,from the time you start to work till the time that they go home they are always busy they are always learning new things from different department. the hardest part of the job is when you are dealing of a mad customer.
good,As a special services associate I provide all information about the store in person and over the phone I also create orders for delivery and or pick-up. Solving return issues is another thing we must provide the customers and also readjusting any online or in-store order that is not satisfying to the customers standards. Attention to detail is needed in this position one mistake can cost the company a lot of money
good,"My experience with Home Depot before was brief, but I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. The team I worked with was very willing to show me the ropes, while also being understanding that his was all new to me."
good,"The customers at Home Depot are usually pretty entertaining. They're usually a bunch of tired old men who have been abusing their bodies working in construction for 10+ years and have a gritty sense of humor. "
good,My time at the south lake home depot was very much so appreciated. I learned how to run a business and matured as a worker. I enjoyed the constant changing and high speed work days.
good,As a company they are very interested in employee success. They provide training and bi-annual reviews. It is possible to move between departments and move up the ladder.
good,Working at home Depot was very challenging at times especially summer time having to deal with humidity for 5 hours each day rounding up carts and loading up customers vehicles
good,"love the people, the management, and the environment but the starting wage is very low and isn’t sustainable to live off of alone even working full time."
good,When your working there you feel safe your team will be with you with whatever question you may have. Everyone is really helpful. The managers are also very helpful. But have to be on top of everything and be able to multi task
good,"The Home Depot takes great care of their employees. I got two bonuses a year and extra money for being an exceptional employee. However, in the store I worked at the working environment could be a little stressful. Some of my fellow co workers lacked drive and the somebody else will take care of it mentality was very strong amongst workers."
good,I enjoy Home Depot they are very nice and understanding of work and life and will exempt you from days missed and will work with you to see what’s wrong.
good,During my time at Home Depot I had insight on how to receive a number of different boxes and packages and how to store them in a certain fashion around the store to where it needed to be stocked stacked and pushed to the front.
good,There was great opportunity to get use to customers and staff. It built a foundation in my life as home depot associate there. My attendance there brought the best out of me from pushing carts and doing some cash registers.
good,"I had in all 3 departments I worked in great leadership, and in 2 a pretty good team, I felt happy to be there when I was and although I left I worked there for a bit over a year and I still feel apart of a team when I see those old co workers."
good,"Am happy by working at the home depot, nice working environment. And i advice home depot for all who are looking gor job, homedepot always hire. Home depot has nice working environment. And also the management is really nice."
good,"Although it takes while to improve but a place to move and grow. To many think to learn and providing excellent customer service."
good,Home Depot was my first job and it was fairly easy. Management was awesome and got along with most everyone who worked there. He atmosphere was very laid back and able to joke around. Could be boring at times because of lack of customers but overall a good place to work.
good,"I loved my experience with Home Depot! We were short staffed often, but I still enjoyed my time there. If we had not been short staffed and scheduled correctly then it would have been next to perfect."
good,"There were meetings all the time, stretches after lunch, all sorts of sayings;  you could live the job like a cult if you wanted to.  The upside is that the benefits are great, the pay is pretty good,and there are lots of other bonuses."
good,"i cant really say anything bad about it. it was a nice fun place to work, great opportunity to grow and move up in the company. they always seemed to want the best for us and encouraged us well. i liked the staff and management. the pay wasnt bad either. all in all its a great company to work for and id recomend it to everyone."
good,"The entitled customers are the only downside. However, management will always have your back 90% of the time. Great job for college students willing to work."
good,"Home Depot is pretty legitimate in their approach towards driving sales and improving the skill of their employees. From my experience, everyone from the different departments was always willing to help or educate each other. The only downsides are the occasional terrible customer and some demanding physical labor."
good,"The Home Depot is a fantastic company to work for. I would recommend any individual who is willing to grow in the business to apply. There are good days and bad days at The Home Depot however, I work with one of the best people in the business world. I've been there for 2 years and it's been a great experience."
good,Unloading merchandise from the truck and then loading it onto the sale floor can be demanding work. Many roles can be physically challenging depending of the task you have been assigned.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was the friends I made at Home Depot as well as enjoyed meeting many new people(customers) whom I learned a lot of how to DIY projects. Also many customers would show pictures of their projects in the works & completed. It was also eye opening to meet so many people that work very hard to provide for their families. Management was friendly & was always letting us know if we needed anything to let them know. The culture was relaxed, everyone is friendly & most helpful."
good,"Home Depot was like going to a retail University. The pay was a little behind but benefits were actually pretty good. You have vacation, sick leave and holiday pay. If the store profitable you will receive a bonus, depends on your level as to how much. "
good,"Home depot is a very good company to work for. The customers and crew are very friendly, even when we become busy in the store. I would definitely recommend this job to someone."
good,"I love learning, it is exciting!  Boy did I learn alot and every single day. "
good,Great for those who wish to work retail. Also great for hireing newly graduated indivuduals. Fast paced and group oriented tasks. Best benefits in the buisness.
good,A typical workday at Home Depot varied. I learned a lot. I bought every black and decker book about everything to learn every department. I also learned how important customer service is. Management is nice and the employees are nice. The hardest part of the job is to please the customer.
good,"Working in an environment where you have the opportunity to meet your town/cities local contractors, real estate agents and landlords is something that I found highly advantageous and constantly overlooked. Although my position was part-time, the part-time pay was above what other retailers offered in the area in addition to being subsidized by the preceding opportunities and learning about the construction materials industry. Unfortunately for in-store sale-specialists, quotas and additional technical responsibilities were expected--leaving the salesperson individually responsible for potentially thousands of dollars of time sensitive client order--were insisted upon without any real considerable incentives. "
good,"Very good company to work for. Good benefits, good pay, and great environment. Scheduled lunch breaks and regular 15min breaks as well. Great place to move up the ladder at your own pace."
good,Home Depot is a great place to work. The only negative thing I have to say about this company is your pay wage is rather low. Although you receive your benefits from your first day of working.
good,"Being a woman working the hardware department can be stressful, as many customers assume you cant do anything, but coworkers are there to support you if your customers are jerks. The management in my store was very understanding when I developed major medical problems and I was switched to an easier department when asked. I only ended up leaving due to my medical circumstances worsening, but it was a good place to work and paid more than most places in my area."
good,The management team is understanding and it is easy to balance your work and personal life. Overall you are given multiple opportunities to expand on your current skill set.
good,I love it....hard working associates great management...get free food free bonus checks....great relationship with coworkers and customers.... happy to be apart m.e.t
good,Productive learning environment. Obtain new knowledge in every position and learning and solving customer needs as the number one priority and teamwork.
good,"the retail environment is changing and people are ordering more online.  I see in the next 15 yrs,  there will be smaller stores  and used to pick up their merchandise.  the self check out lines are increasing."
good,"I would clock in, organize the lot, assist customers with loading their products and take breaks when scheduled. This would include using a forklift that I had received a licence for."
good,"It is a joy and awesome to work at a place where they treat you like you are apart of there family. The bond all the Associate have is like no other. We all keep each other safe , so at the end of the day we all can go back to our families"
good,"It was fun working at homed, you see all your neighbors and just getting to meet new people and helping customers with their personal or contact projects, always trying to keep  a smile on their face because people in the front are always going to be seen once they first walk and the last to see when they walk out"
good,"I'm a paint associate and my job is to tend to the customers and answer any questions they might have as well as mix paint and face the department. The most difficult part of the job is just learning how to identify customers needs based on what they tell you they want because 7/10 times they don't know what they're doing. That's where your sakes knowledge comes in and you have to push them in the right direction. I came into my department not knowing anything about paint but the other associates as well as the pro painters will teach you everything you need to know. It's also such a nice environment from the mix of experienced and inexperienced people that if I can't answer a customer question, another associate or even another customer will step forward and help out."
good,"Day starts with a morning meeting that usually lasts anywhere from 10-20 minutes depending on how much there is to go over for the day. The team then splits in half, one working on projects such as putting a new product in along with the new signage and displays if it has any; the other half does general service which is basically up keep on all products in the store, making sure they're stocked and looking good as well as dusting displays and putting new ones up if they are missing. Gives you great time management skills as you always have a time limit on projects. The culture is very close knit, basically a second family."
good,"Job is decent. Hard work, easy to catch on. Management could be better, co workers are great. Co workers are always there to help when you need it, very team oriented."
good,"Great company to work for. The company genuinely cares for its associates and community.  Pay is competitive, the work is hard but rewarding. There is always room for advancement."
good,"Fast pace and working constantly maintaining a safe work environment. Home Depot is a great company to work for. There’s just not much potential for growth, that’s the only problem ."
good,Will recommend for inters and new grads. People work as a team and will assist you with you immediate needs. The job is challenging in terms of learning different things every day but perfect for those who want to learn.
good,"The people are what makes this place awesome to work at (Greenwood), but if you are trying to pay for living expenses you will need someone else to split bills with."
good,"The Home Depot offers a lot of opportunities for advancement. The  Home Depot also offers great benefits like payed sick time, maternity leave and the 401k."
good,I knew what was expected of me and the supervisor let me do my job with out much interference. There where lots of opportunity for advancement if a person wanted to pursue that course of action.
good,"The sense of community in Home Depot was suprising. I quickly became part of the family. They appreciate every single person and every single role. You don’t feel overlooked."
good,"Good place for a steady job"
good,">ORGANIZE."
good,"I've worked at another Home Depot, happily left it at the end of the season.  It is still a very stressful store to work in, according to others who have transferred."
good,Home Depot is a very fast-pace work environment. The company caters their customers. And they go the extra mile for their employees as well. A typical day at Home Depot consist of non stop attending to the customer needs and finding out what merchandise will be a great fit for the customer. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to meet new people on a daily basis. In all the different personalities that each individual possesses.
good,Was able to transfer positions and shifts as needed. If you have the want you can grow with the company. Unfortunately that doesn't mean that you are not replaceable.
good,"Home Depot was/is an “associate” focused company.  The organization promotes a diverse environment which works to inspire their associates to provide excellent customer service.  Giving Back is a practice within this company, not only to the associates, but to the communities as well."
good,"Great job to work at."
good,"Great job for a person going to college and looking for flexible hours. The work it fast-paced, enjoyable, fun co-workers. Overall enjoy the company core-values and employees are treated with respect and fairly. Management enjoyable and friendly and easy to work for."
good,"Being in the field at 7:30am. taking care of my customers needs and wants, cold calling and building new customer base. The hardest part was getting inventory to my customer."
good,"Excelente empresa, que se preocupa por el ambiente laboral, la estabilidad y crecimiento personal y laboral de sus empleados."
good,"It's hard to say retail was relaxing, but it was often gratifying in a way. Skills become unknowingly built upon, you'll notice you were suddenly able to hold conversations on things you had never done, be it drywall or electrical. Just the immersion of being around people who know what they are talking about makes you learn. Patience is a must, but honestly the working conditions are better than most fortune 500 companies. It's actually a tad satisfying receiving not one but two bonus checks a year, yeah the bosses get the big bonus checks but you get free food free two hours of pay and then a bonus check based on how the store performed for the past 6 months. Much more decent than my current job where I work 80-100 hours a week and at the end of the project my boss gets the bonus check and brings us pizza for a nice 1/1000 piece of the pie he was handed."
good,"Retail, fast paced environment, a lot of self learning, but if you are motivated there is a lot of room for advancement.  Company offers great benefits, paid sick time, bonuses, 401k"
good,"As someone with no prior sales experience, this job helped me advance my people skills and learn to sell just about anything to anyone. The people are great, the customers are usually pretty good too, and the hours are pretty flexible. 10/10 recommend this job to someone interested in beginning a sales career."
good,"Very supportive of needs when in difficult situations, and family oriented. Transfers available for those who want to relocate to a different store in any state when requested. Affordable benefit plans."
good,"Home Depot is definitely a fun place to work. As a worker, you get to meet and know new people, the customers and co-workers alike. I'm truly glad that I joined."
good,"Responsible for providing customer service in a fast pace , making sales Making sure my department was near and organized training new team members. went from unloading trucks to sales associate"
good,"For the Merchandiser position, we start at 5 am and end at 130 pm Monday through Friday with some weekends optional of overtime (depending on season). We merchandised products, pack-down, straighten the bays, projects, price changes, etc."
good,"The Home Depot, offer career advancement and is a stable working place. The work load can be straining at times with the heavy lifting at time, if you work hard and believe in your self you can make it through it."
good,"The job has great pay, the associates are amazing people and very out going. The management is good but could be better. They're very friendly and out going and understanding and help out thier customers and employees to the greatest extent."
good,"Great place to work and plenty of room for advancement, really good place to grow in this company and the management is very helpful and professional and the care about the workers."
good,I enjoy working at Home Depot. But as a worker doing concrete bags for minimum wage didn't seem fitting anymore since I injured my back. Other than that I love working there!
good,"My Home Depot has great management, if you have ever seen commercials showing off a great community in the workplace, then you know what I am referring to."
good,Because I Work In The Paint Department I Have The Habit Where I Need To Pack Down EveryDay & Make Sure The Shelf Is Stocked 24/7. I Do This On A Normal Basis.
good,"I learn a lot from this inventory job. Starting from packing down, helping the customers, driving ballymore lift, sorting crown bolts, doing bay service, doing store electrical maintenance. Overall, I must be multi-tasking, having excellent problem solving, having excellent communication, knowing how to manage my time and organized my work."
good,"I enjoy my time working at home depot, the store manager really cares about the associates.  I just wish there was more opportunities to grow in the store but it seems like department managers don't want to take the time out to train their associates."
good,"I have worked for HD for 3 years and I very much enjoy the people I work with as well as the management.  I definitely know more about your everyday, common DIY projects, ranging from electric to plumbing, to Flooring.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the angry customer that feels they have been treated unjustly.  There are many different personalities in our team but everyone gets along and works together to make sure the customer walks away happy.  This is helpful and makes for an enjoyable day on the job.......And HEY, if your hired on as a Kitchen Designer they send you to Atlanta for week and feed you really well."
good,Benefits wise is very excellent for Part- Time however there is waiting list for Fulltime job is the downfall and pay is not enough for single person.
good,"It's a fast paced fun place to work. Fun working with the public ,  get to do several different jobs . Ability to make customers happy no matter what."
good,"Worked in many different departments in the store, enjoyable atmosphere for a retail job. Management and coworkers definitely made the job more enjoyable."

good,As an Assistant Manager I was paid well but hours were very long and schedule was inconsistent. Many career advancement opportunities. Is a great place to work
good,"I worked at store 6851.  The whole group is one big family.  We all look out for one another.  We always have special events going on in the store, eg sunglasses day, where a silly hat etc."
good,"A typical day would be just to clock in, figure out how much work we have for the day, get the items from the shipping area, and stock the items."
good,"My job each day is balancing of all monies received for the day before on all cash registers.  Preparing money to be sent out for the following day.  Responsible for all equipment that may go down for that day.  Providing excellent customer service internally and externally. I enjoy my responsibilities to my cashiers, department heads, assistant managers and manager.  Their requests during the day can be major, such as pen pad, register, scan gun or printers may go down.  Its imperative that I get subject fixed or called in for a service call. Days can be long and busy but love the challenges to get it right, which is too the hardest part of my job. I enjoy all the challenges and employees.  My relationship with all makes my job much easier and my determination to get it right. In all its a great place to work for I have set hours and days.  Not the same for most employees."
good,"Great entry level position with stability, structure and guidance from management. Not to mention the positive work-life balance and fun young culture that goes with the company."
good,I enjoyed working at The Home Depot. They have a friendly staff and always great attitudes during any situation. My situation just didn’t work with them but I’d definitely recommend working here
good,"So, showing enthusiasm for a friendly and fun atmosphere, or the people one worked with, and/or the fact that the leadership team was great, helps make your answer relevant to the question by being enthusiastically true."
good,I have been working at the home depot for 15 years and have had several different positions which has even more experience...than any other has...over the years I have meant so many associates and customers and became to love...and has also meant managers as well and leadership their can give me a  Opportunities
good,"The Home Depot was understanding if a family issue came up. "
good,"i learned multi tasking skills , customer service skills, an just working really fast paced. it's a good workplace also with good managing. Hardest part of the job would b when it is really busy and that is when you need to use your multi-tasking skills and try your best with great customer service."
good,"I enjoyed working for Home Depot, as far as retail goes, the respect it demonstrates towards its employees is astounding. I never once felt belittled or unneeded. The wage was sufficient for the tasks and I never felt like I was being overworked."
good,"I'd clock in, sweep and front face all the aisles in the garden department then as soon as the store opens I was on the floor giving my helping hand to costumers in need. This job not only taught me the value of time management and how important it is to clock in and out between breaks but also the value of patients."
good,Buenas prestaciones y excelente cultura organizacional dentro del CEDIS.
good,"Days go by quickly, can be hectic when associates aren't scheduled correctly for other departments though. An average day is aggressively seeking customers out, and solving any issues they have, while trying to make sure the shelves are stocked in the process."
good,Such a great work enviroment everyone there is so friendly and really treat you like family i miss it there its fast paced and the day just goes by so quickly
good,"The people are amazing and very helpful, but if they see you getting paid too much or have too many hours they'll cut a weeks worth of hours. Most people working there have a second job but you get paid a decent amount for the work you do. It's very laid back but has its stressful moments. The supervisors are very helpful and understanding, and the head cashiers are always willing to help work through issues with you."
good,"I would recommend investing in a good pair of boots or shoes that support you while 95% of the job is standing and moving. Overall, a great environment!"
good,Home Depot provides many areas of opportunity if you are flexible and able to move to pursue opportunities in those states that they may be available.
good,my day was about helping customers throughout the store and helping them load their purchases on the lumber end of the store and other areas when needed
good,I had a very pleasant experience working here and would have continued had life not forced me to relocate. This is an excellent place to work if you are working multiple jobs or are in school. they will always work with you on issues.
good,"I don't have a typical work day, every day is different. I work with a great team who take care of the products and most importantly the Customer. The Management team is very supportive and cares about their people. We have a diverse culture and that I believe is the best part of the job. The hardest part is when you have too many sick calls and are unable to help customers fast enough."
good,"Home Depot is a beautiful place to work and to grow as a person, Me as an associate I have developed from a cashier to a service desk associate. Learning new skills to help improve Home Depot as a company was and is the essential pleasure."
good,Fue una de las experiencias más divertidas en las que he pasado en mi vida y a la vez de las  curiosas pues todos los días se aprende de algo nuevo todos los días
good,It was a well mannered environment with genuinely good people within the store and community. Easy work days were definitely a plus and an understanding group of fellow piers.

good,I really enjoyed working at Home depot. It was a very rewarding experience. I loved helping customers in there home improvements. I learned how to assist every customer with each of their needs. It felt like such a family environtment.
good,Its good. I always had to be on time to get picked up had to ride out to the locations. The only thing i didnt like was that i didnt get paid for going to the location but it is understandable because driving to the location isnt really considerd working and i did have to learn everything quickly and build a routine sceadule for as soon as we had gotten to job sites. A very non lazy job
good,Great place to work!  They really do the right thing by the employees and customer.  They are fair.  Customers are the most difficult part of the job.  People can be incredible unreasonable.
good,Had no issues working here was great hours and pay! Just wanted to pursue being a preschool teacher. Everybody was friendly and we had a lot casual meetings for everyone to connect in turn working better together.
good,Ambiente laboral agradable con promoción para crecer
good,"this place was great for the first 10 years i worked there but managers changed for the worse, workers weren' t happy any longer.service of workers and store performance went downhill. from the best home depot in our distrcist to 4. Very hard work due to heavy merchandise to lift. product knowledge and speedy ring up."
good,something to start out with as a new person to the work field. always looking forward to seeing my coworkers though they have helped me push through some of the tough days.
good,Great place to work. Plenty of opportunity to move up management there cares about the people they will work with you no matter what. Great part-time or full-time job
good,The working environment was fast paced and challenging because you had to work with the public.  You had to meet every customer's need and sometimes the customers can be a little difficult to please. You get to meet all kinds of people and if you listen to each one of them they can teach you things you didn't know.
good,I was able to move and head 5 different departments while working for the Home Depot.  I learned something new each and every day.  I would recommend working for them.
good,"A typical day at work is always filled with tasks and items to work on completing, and has a wonderful customer centered atmosphere. We are encouraged to work safely and ask for help when needed."
good,Great experience with a lot of different people. Loading and unloading for lawn and garden. Friendly managers always eager to help you if you need help
good,"Bring in loads and orders, confirm accuracy. learned to use Pacer and forklift to move and store pallets. Management was great. Safety focused culture but great people. Hardest part was to make sure the orders were correct every time and to keep on track with the chemical procedures. Using the forklifts was probably the best part."
good,"My typical day at work was to do my morning reports, check my emails, and voice mail.  During my time at this job, I learned how to keep up with a 1.6 million sq. ft. warehouse, by keeping products needed for productivity stocked, hazmat logs and pick.  I also did conference calls with and without my GM, helped in Transportation, scheduled appointments for GM, scheduled conferences for GM, and took Corporate to lunch when down from Atlanta.  We were made to take breaks to our exercise room to exercise or to just relax."
good,"typical day consists of waking up, calling and scheduling appointments with clients. afterward then creating a route on your maps app to efficiently make all scheduled appointments on time. then head out to perform Measuring services provided through the Home Depot."
good,"This was a productive and fun workplace. Everyone i was worked with had a great attitude, and was willing to help with what ever they could. I was trained on a regular basis and received 3 licenses to drive their in-store trucks."
good,"Hired as Pro Sales Manager for newly opened store. Worked with local contractors to provide pricing of home construction materials. Completed & processed credit applications for commercial & residential customers. Was head cashier for lumber dept. Scheduled deliveries of lumber, building materials to local customers. Supervised floor employees in lumber dept, cashiers & our truck drivers. Completed employee reviews with recommendations. Represented Home Depot Store within the community. ex. Chamber of Commerce, work shops, donations etc."
good,A Friendly environment with kind  customers make  work a place where yo have a team  that understand what need needs to be done and most importantly how it needs to be done with out damaging our misplacing the merchandise or sale promotions
good,"At The Home Depot we are expected to know a lot by the customer. Many employees are great in customer service, excluding those who are there just to get paid, and exceed the expectation of the customer."
good,The job I had was very physical being in the lumber dept. You learn a lot working closely with other workers. The most fun at the job was helping others.
good,"Although i am a fit individual, working at the warehouse was physically demanding. It is still a doable job, but you do have to maintain pace with the speed at which everything is moving even if you have to lift heavier objects than another person."
good,Sales professional experience and product educational references on materials needed in construction industry of US that defferent from other country  I got it.
good,We would do our job each day with our manager.Unpacking an unloading was done by my team.  We would train once a week in new skill so we could do our job better.
good,"I would recommend this job to anyone if they can secure a full-time job with the company. Huge benefits! Health, dental, vision, 401k with matching, etc."
good,Managers and other co-workers were actually very pleasant to work with ! Customer were usually always awesome and we had out regulars that knew you by your name.
good,I loved working there to help people fix there homes. The only bad thing that i can say about that job was there was not enough hours at the time i was working there.
good,I enjoyed my time working at this fine company. The hours were flexible and so was the days worked. The other associates really made the work day fun.
good,The work environment was always different. Not one day is the same as the last one. Some days are slower then others but overall its fast paced how I like it. The management is fairly good too.
good,Excellent place to work. Great organization. Great customer service taught excellent training course.never afraid to ask for help.the Managers were wonderful to work for .fair breaks and lunch. Pay was good. I was pregnant at the time I worked there they were understandable and gave me the time off I needed.
good,There would be no tips that I can think of to improve or change since I have had no other job to compare it to. The job on the other hand has been very helpful to me about that line of work.
good,"There is a lot of room to move around at Home Depot and the jobs are fairly exciting and simple. My only issue is the pay. You get a raise every year but it's not very much, and given the stress that you will sometimes get from the job it's up to you to decide if the pay is worth it."
good,"waiting a half year to get training on equipment like forklift and still did not get that. Bad hours, nice people. No discounts for employees. Keeps you busy."
good,Working for Home Depot helped me gain a lot of insight into how to deal with customers of varying emotions. From irate customers to ones who want you to make the decision for them. I learned how to ask the right questions to offer the best product for them. Working with other staff that had the same mindset helped the days go by fast and helped me reach my full potential.
good,"Home Depot thinks of their employees and their families."
good,Home depot puts a lot of emphasis on that the bottom of the ladder employees is what keeps their business running. So they make sure that you are well taken care of and provide excellent benefits.
good,"Being bilingual and knowing many departments was a good and bad thing. Management would go to you for help, but then that would backfire because you were everywhere but where you were supposed to be. Management can be very helpful but are some times where they weren't much help. Awesome coworkers, team task, interesting customers."
good,"Good place to work for me in a part-time capacity to supplement main career. It is a fast paced retail position dealing with many great customers and a few very difficult and impatient customers, the latter of whom seem to have a chip on their shoulder about large corporate America."
good,My experience with working at the Home Depot gave me an opportunity to learn new things do things I've never done. I like my co-workers they are fun to work with and are very cool. I take pride in doing a great job and satisfying customers' needs. I am very satisfied with how much I've experienced and learned along the way by my fellow co-workers.
good,Home depot is an outstanding place to work and the company goes out of its way to take care of its people. I truly enjoyed the time that I worked there and only left for an opportunity at full time employment.
good,The company provides an excellent benefits package and will give you an opportunity to move up in the company if you want too.  I enjoyed the customer service focus.
good,"In the 6 months I've worked at Home Depot, I've learned a mountain worth of information about a vast amount of departments. It has been a great opportunity to learn more about retail and customer interactions."
good,"If you love working with customers and solving their problems, then this is the place to work. New challenges every day. Always room to grow and learn more. There is a lot to learn that you can take home and use."
good,I enjoy working here. People are extremely helpful and the pay was not the best but it at least reflected each and every job description. You can learn as much as you want with the company.
good,"Great job, relaxed paced, but attention to detail is required. Is a minimum wage job and sometimes I feel like the work I do should pay just a little bit more."
good,"Employment at the Home Depot will help you to learn a bit about every possible home improvement that could come to mind. Most associates recieve training on topics such as plumbing, roofing, insulation, and many other household necessities.

good,"-to greet customer and to assist customer"
good,"Really enjoyed the customers we had and interacting/forming bonds with the regular customers (contractors, etc.).

The store managers were all nice and understanding, they also did work, which proved not only their leadership skills, but their abilities. My coworkers were all friendly; the older one's were cometimes mean to new comers.

Management was great they cared for their employees as well as acknowledge and support them when they did an excellent job.  I loved my coworkers they were great people to be around as well to work with.

Overall, a great part time job, especially for a full-time student needing flexible hours."

good,"I came in the company as a temp to hire. By my 2nd week there, I was called into the office and asked if I would like to take a full-time permanent position. I agreed and was very pleased that they had noticed my drive to move up in the company and how hard I worked."

good,"My job on the freight team at Home Depot was a blend of a basic retail environment mixed with warehouse duties/setup, and also a different experience daily. Each day brought a new customer base, new things to help people with, and also new things to learn. The customer base was the best thing about the job, learning things from people just as much as they could learn from me. Hearing about projects people were working on was definitely a unique experience!"
good,"Home Depot treated their associates, managers, vendors with respect and fairness. The culture in this company is can do and everyone is willing to work as a team member to achieve the greater good"
good,"I loved working at the Home Depot. Co-workers and management were very friendly and always helpful. If the garden cashiers called for loading assistance, I would be there to help any customer. I made sure all our merchandise were fully stocked and made sure the aisles were clean and clear of any debris or dirt. I assisted and answered any questions or concerns the customers had. I also would perform any extra task my manager/supervisor would assign me accurately and on time. Only thing I didn't really enjoy was not getting enough hours."
good,"This was a routine job. I soley worked on the cashier and opened credit card accounts on a daily basis. It also consisted of over the phone customer service. I had some pretty easy going co workers, and management pretty much covered what ever I needed help with or taken care of. The hardest part about this job is the load and weight the supplies can be, bareable but can be sometimes a bit for one person to try to handle. I overall enjoyed this job and its assests."
good,Not technically difficult but physically demanding (a lot of standing on hard concrete and lifting heavy objects).

Management is very understanding a flexible when it comes to scheduling.  My co-workers are fun people to be around we see a lot interesting people come in Home Depot.  The hardest part of the job is when I'm not able to please a customer as I would like to.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when we success share and receive extra money for our great customer service.

good,"Home Depot is a type a company that helps you get ahead in their store, you could learn different departments by going on the computer and taking the test, they want to see you advance and get ahead in their store. Some of the co-workers were willing to help me when I first started their but then there were a few workers that did not give my experience a good one. I had one co-worker who made my second week at home depot a bad one, she was being trained to be a Supervisor and all she did was holler at me for a good 20 min and when I told her that I already talked with our Supervisor about the situation she did not want to her it, she holler at me in front of the other employees. After I talked to the Supervisor and told him if he is training her to be a Supervisor than he is training her the wrong way. Other than that I learned what Power Pack down was about and some ways it was kind of fun lifting all those heavy boxes and taking them down off the over stock shelves and stocking the shelves with the product. Some of the manager's words are not bond(when a customer tell about a employee and how the employee did a good job of helping the customer look for an item or help purchase an item than the manager is suppose to recognize the employee), I got in trouble for helping a customer out. The customer was looking for some knee pads and I did not want the customer to leave the store unhappy so I did my best to look for the knee pads, once I found them I went to look for the customer so that I could give it to him. I found the customer and he was happy, he went and told my manager"

good,this job keeps me very busy and on my toes at all times. I have learned more about giving excellent customer service. Management team is great and my co-workers are good team players. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers that are rude. The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy.
good,"Home Depot m'a donné beaucoup des opportunités pour avancer et beaucoup de cométences professionelles.  Par exemple, j'ai travaillé dans 4 départements différents et j'ai profité des idées différentes chaque département, pourtant l'idée principale de Home Depot était prendre soin de clients.  Actuellement, je pense de cette idée à chaque job, métier, ou classe que j'enseigne.  Qu'est-ce que la plus important pour les élèves ou les clients? Et puis, je peux utiliser cette idée à mon métier prochain."
good,"Home Depot is the most difficult retail career you can have, but also most rewarding. Got to work with great staff and able to provide world class customer service."
good,"iThe most enjoyable  part of the job was customer service and working along side of Home Depot  Associates with my product knowledge and sales ability on Black Friday.  The Black Friday weeks gave me the opportunity to heightened sales and consumer interest in the Maytag product line.  My Store Manager awarded me the Homer award for my continuous efforts in sales and constant push on product knowledge.  My favorite Maytag products were ICE H2O, the competitive and strong Centennial Line washer/dryer and the outstanding Bravo's pair."
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work. It has excellent benefits, and opportunity for advancement."
good,A day at work is very fast past. You need a lot off energy  working at this warehouse. I learn most of my ideas from my customers. Most customers just want to brain storm. They just want to run ideas by you before they make the final di decision. I view my co- workers as professionals. Once you punch in you should dedicate yourself and time to the company and customer. The hardest part of this job is not having what the consumer needs in stock and not making the final sale.
good,Working as a parking lot attendant was a daily challenge in heavy physical labor. Personal fitness management and safe lifting practices were a must have set of skills. the management was very professional and able to handle most situations very quickly and with little difficulty. The most rewarding part was working with and helping our customers.
good,Upbeat positive attitude Ongoing weekly and monthly training opportunities Positive feed back from management Diverse back ground of co-workers makes an interesting and fun environment The hardest part of the job is being on the concrete all day The most enjoyable part is the co-workers and customers
good,"Great people, excellent service and benefits, and very understanding."
good,"Helping a lot of customers through out the day. Learned a lot of information about products in order to help and communicated with a diverse group of customers and employees. The hardest part about the job is to learn about new products everyday, helping customers in departments that we are not familiar with. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to communicate with a diverse group of people."
good,"I started there as a PT cashier eventually becoming a Department Manager of 2 different departments. At Home Depot I learned hard work, great customer service and a willingness to learn is what it takes to succeed. We worked as team and cross trained everyone. I had a Front End Supervisor that told me to ask to go to different departments to learn, ask for more training than what was required and to be on time.  I took her advice and quickly moved up. I enjoyed the customers, my coworkers and the daily quick pace of retail. I enjoyed the weekly sales meetings going over the numbers from each department and the P &L for the store.  The hardest part of the job was making sure everyone was on the same page."
good,"Home Depot really understand the value of an employee. They meke every each one of their employees feel a sence of accomplishment, sence of ownership, ect.."
good,During my time at Home depot I learned the importance of book keeping/accounting.
good,"Management was okay, the ASM's were great, not much of the manager."
good,"Home Depot while Efficiently run is a rather typical work environment. The only thing extraordinary about the company is the extensive training one has to go through before working in a specific department. The training is thorough and precise, the process made the transition into the store from a previous non-retail job very comfortable."
good,"Great management, Great people to work with, Learned to operate a Pace Truck.  Hardest part of the job was balancing direct time and indirect time while resolving issues."
good,"Customer satisfaction was a priority. As a sales associate, I would ask every customer how I could help them. I would accommodate them by showing them tools they my need for their particular jobs. If they needed help learning to use the tools, I would show them how to operate the tool to get the best result."
good,"I enjoy everything about this job, except furthering my career goals."
good,"Company geared towards the well being of the customer,the customer is always first"
good,most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smile on the face of the customers when you fulfill all their needs

good,"-Always on your feet, some time to rest but always moving."
good,Amazing company with tons of room for advancement. Some management can pull rank and be partial to employee favoritism but overall fair. Great compensation and incentives for future plans. 
good,"I really enjoyed working at home depot, I had a lot of pride helping guests find what they needed, the management there was excellent, "
good,I great enviroment to really find a place in.  Everyone was really hard workers and would always be looking out for all of hte other employees and not just all about themsleves.
good,"In many large companies, management styles vary.  I did decide that a it was time for me to move on.  Staffing was not applied appropriately in time of need.  I would be only one on floor with 4 on hand and when busy, no one could be found.  I simply felt I was being used to much.  That encouraged me to move on."
good,"I go to work and clock in, and if I am early I usually hang out in the break room until my shift starts.  when I go out unto the floor I see my head cashier , and she tells me what I will be located. I spend the remainder of the day on my feet ringing up , or assisting customers.  the management are all very good and understanding people, they are always there to help you. I love my co-workers, they all encourage team work, and everyone makes you feel like family. the hardest part of the job is making sure they every customer leaves happy, everyone has a different problem to deal with, and since the store is so big, as a cashier there are a lot of items that you have to be familiar with. the most enjoyable part are interacting with the people. "
good,"come in speak to everyone , clock in, head to my department , see what needs to be filled, start filling until store closed at 9pm then head to stockroom to help unload pallets from truck and place in proper department for stocking. Had a good working relationship with co-workers. the hardest part was staying awake once 5am hit"
good,"The employees at Home Depot were down to earth, good people. It was a busy job...lots to do. I loves working with and advising the customers. Ongoing training was excellent."
good,"Excelente empresa, procuran la estabilidad emocional y laboral del empleado tal vez por que en esa unidad y en ese tiempo colaboraba un excelentisimo director digno de admiracion al igual que todo su staff ejecutivo."
good,"Es una empresa con buenos valores, donde se aprenden muchas cosas nuevas cada día y hay capacitación constante."
good,I enjoy working for the company. They are a great company to work for. Unfortunetly the pay is not very good for a single father.
good,"A typical day at work is kinda hard to put into words at times... Being as I was a department supervisor, the typical scenario would change from day to day."
good,"Always on time, do my task to the best of my ability.Respect my co-workers and management team.The hardest part of my job is getting up at 4:00 am to get to work ,the most enjoyable is the people ,never seen anyone not get along ."
good,cashier
good,"my day starts of like any other day .........working with the community,helping others answering phones ,filing ..........but what i like most is meeting new people each and every day"
good,"Great place to work, outstanding people. Very customer oriented very dedicated to their employees."
good,"I worked in the fuel center, aka the ""baby box,"" of which Home Depot has only 6 in existance. It was a fun place to work, with a team of 8-9 working there. Management is fun and easy to work with. Co-workers are fun and easy to work with as well. Hardest part of the job was having to be at work at 5 am given i am not a morning person. The most enjoyable part was the customer interactions and co-workers who always kept me laughing and smiling."
good,"I worked there a short time but it was probably the most enjoyable job I've ever had, my co-workers and management were very good people, each day everyone no matter what their mood had a smile on their faces ready to help customers, and interact in good team spirit and teamwork. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about all the various items in the store, and educating customers about everything, and operating the cash register."
good,great product
good,"You're moved around a lot which actually helps gain experience always a chance for advancement, meeting new people daily."
good,"El ambiente laboral bueno, los gerentes nos hacian sentir que podiamos confiar en ellos y podiamos expresarnos sin temor a represalias."
good,Very enjoyable place to be at very identical to my experience at Lowes
good,Performed a combination of cleaning duties to maintain hotel rooms. duties include making beds replenishing linens cleaning rooms and halls and vacuum.. Attend to vistors and dealt with inquiries on the phones and face to face. Supplied information regarding the organization to the general public and customers.. reserved rooms and processed customer.

good,take care of customers needs as they come in. make sure will calls and deliveries are ready for the customer. i learned that customer are the most important part of any job. I enjoy taking care of the customer and the opportunity to handle all their needs. I love a challenge.
good,I wasn't sure what to expect when I started at Home Depot. I really didn't think I would enjoy the job due to me having no experience in Home Improvement work. But even though I was thrown into a department with no manual training I caught up pretty quick thanks to helpful employees. I have to say it was the first job I actually enjoyed working at but management wasn't the best.
good,"a usual day is doing morning/closing reports, cashier back-ups, placing bulk orders, special orders, or bush orders for customers present or over the phone and answering in-store calls to direct to the correct departments. Management always changes so our duty is to inform them the things we do at the front desk and to get to know who we work with and try to deal with any customer complaints before getting Management involved. The hardest part is when we are short of workers and have customers on phone lines waiting to be assist while assisting customers in the store while covering our returns associate but the key is not to stress but try to work in the most officiant way possible to assist everyone but the enjoyable part is having great workers in other department who are capable of assisting when needed at the front to satisfy each customers needs without having to wait long"
good,"Working for Home Depot is one of the best company I have worked for. The store I work at is like a family. We have what is called a Homer Fund and that is to help those who need some extra money lilke for rent, ecty. I leaning the defferent departments, like Hardward, Garden. We have to do what is called a Tool Belt which we do every month."
good,The pay is wack cool enviroment summer time is a big no standing outside n garden alll day u will bmad
good,"On a day-to-day basis I could be placed in any one of three departments: paint, garden, or hardware. For a great part of the day I am providing customer service by working directly with the customer; picking out paint colors, mixing paint, helping with gardening ideas, etc. During other parts of the day I will be cleaning up the department by down-stocking merchandise, putting everything in their particular homes, etc."
good,A typical day here at the Home Depot is great. I enjoy my management team and love the co-workers I work with. The most enjoyable part is working outside in the garden department to get fresh air and seeing the beautiful plants.
good,"I loved working here. It was great to work / interact with the guys in the warehouse as well as to interact with the truck drivers that came to pick up the deliveries. The management was great. Very easy to tlak to if there were any problems, concerns or even complaints (which was very rare). This job was the epitomy of a ""team effort"" and I would recommend it to anyone! My only problem was the shift that I was working. After a while working 2nd shift with a small child at home became very demanding because I was rarely able to spend the quality time that I'd like to with him. That was the ONLY reason I resigned. Otherwise I feel i probably could have stayed there for a long period of time."
good,"At this job you are constantly learning, I worked in milworks where we sold doors, windows and molding and coming into this department I knew nothing. They train you and mold you to be an expert. That way if your customer has any questions they will leave there happy, satisfied, and with their product. It was a great learning experience."
good,Fun place to work. Great atmosphere and good benefits. Management was nice. A good place to possible advance in.
good,Outstanding growth potential for an progressive individual to grow with the company that dedicated its services in helping and providing its customers with best products and services to assist with their home improvement projects

good,i really feel this job was one of the best i ever had. the only reason i left this job was that i needed to better my life.
good,I loved my time at Home Depot. I would go back there in a heartbeat. I really enjoyed being around such creative and knowledgeable people on a daily basis. The casual atmosphere is nice too (jeans and shorts). For the most part customers and other employees are very nice to work with. Management was also very accomodating and understanding if I needed something.
good,I learned that working at the Home Depot they like to make sure that your safe and that the customers are safe as well. My coworkers were very nice and made sure that I was having a good day.
good,It's a great company to work for. They helped out a lot of people.  Military people  .. This company does a lot of charity work.. They take great care of them please
good,"My typical day consists of attending customers in a way that makes them feel important and secure. I address everyone with courtesy. I help customers find the products they need and give details or instruction when necessary. I place stock on the shelves, organize product, and adjust inventory. The managers are very helpful and friendly, as well as my co-workers, and we treat each other respectfully. The hardest part of the job is occasionally moving heavy items around the store, and the best part is working as a team with great people."
good,"I started out as part-time in , garden working hard over a cores of a few months . I went from part time to full time in garden department . every one I work with is awesome from the managers to the associates , every one is just down to earth . like any thing some days are better than others. currently serving on the stores safety comity , and helping other associates to stay safe while working . the leadership class helped me understand that there is more to learn, and grow within the company .  I have been there  a year now , and am moving to the front end of the store. basically bring my knowledge of garden to help customers in my new department."

good,Overall I really like my job. There is always going to be people that are difficult to work with at any workplace. If you work hard and show that you want to be part of a successful team its not hard to get a full time position. The pay is not great but ok. There are some good benefits.
good,"Customer service is a priority."
good,"Everyday we come in at 6:45pm and unload the truck and stock the merchandise on the shelves. What can't pack out we throw up top in the overhead. Everyone work as a team to not only lighten up the load, but also to get the job done before the store opens in that morning."
good,I've been working with the home Depot for almost 3 years and it's so great company to work for with knowledgeable managers. The benefits are good. There is also flexibility to transfer anywhere in the US.
good,"Hours are 40 per week. Somewhat flexible but not really. Pay for job responsibilities and risk is not near enough. This is a $25 an hour job, that they, if your lucky might start with 16..."

good,Start my day very typical collecting trash outside because carts haven't been touched yet. Learned great customer service. great management. chill and relaxed no need to rush things. Hardest part was lifting heavy items at times. Very Simple nothing too complex was very enjoyable part of the job.
good,A typical day at home depot i would start off by getting all the carts that were out in the parking lot and putting them in the front. The management was good but the hardest part of the job was some associates did not treat others with upmost respect. The most enjoyable part was the friendships i made at work. That helped make work more enjoyable.
good,"Overall, it is a great place to start career. Company cares about its people. Software development culture is geared around pair-programming and collaboration, and is a great environment to learn."
good,"Just be ready to work you get 4 10 hour days and 3 off days unless  you want o.t. Depending  on what department  you're  in you will definitely  have to work.

good,"The Home Depot is a great company to work for. They are very understanding of your personal life and how it affects your work. If you have mental issues they help out with that and work around your problems(myself). The Home Depot provides snacks, water, and orders/cooks food a lot randomly. Working for The Home Depot is pretty chill."
good,"My experience at the Home Depot has given me the opportunity to know how to serve customers and satisfy their needs. My fellow associates were very friendly and helpful. We maintained a good relationship throughout the store. "

good,"Worked as 3rd shift stocking team. I would unload truck, and put out stock-store-inventory for the night shift. After we would  count the pallets....."
good,"Very fast paced environment, although if youre going to work on the freight team I don't believe they pay enough for the work they require you to do.  It's tough getting things done because most of the time they place too many restrictions on how you work, and theres usually not a full team offloading trucks"
good,everyone is helpful. home depot is a company that you can make a career if you really want it. home depot will help you move up as far as you want to go.

good,Une belle ambiance en magasin. Direction toujours ouverte à des commentaires.
good,"I loved the one on one costumer environment."
good,"I loved working for the Home Depot. Only issue I had was because of my disability, I had to call out of work often. I was given a lot of warnings and then was given written warnings. I was on my last write up when I quit. I had decided to quit because of my health and I did it without notice. I was told that I just needed to bring in a letter of resignation. However, I ended up becoming the victim of a domestic violence crime and had to leave the area, and therefore had no transportation to give my letter to management. I didn't give it to them until about 2 weeks after I quit, and by then, because they didn't get the letter they marked me as ""terminated"" in the system. I would absolutely work for Home Depot again, though."
good,"The job was a fun experience I enjoyed my time there. Got to interact with some co workers who end up becoming long time friends.  I felt like we should have been getting paid more the work we was doing but overall its a pretty cool job, you just gotta have the uplifting energy"

good,I love home depot.The environment is lovely.They slso know how to interact with there customers effectively and the managers are professionals.They make sure everything is taken care of
good,"The customers at The Home Depot weren't always the friendliest or greatest people; however, the people who worked there and the management were all really tight knit and close, everyone was willing to lift each other up and were all very supportive. The management really made it a goal to contribute to your growth, as a person and as an employee."
good,Management are mostly reasonable and helpful. Associates also are help full when I need any answers about any other department. There is no other way to say that management has been improving.
good,"Not a bad place to work, you got to be willing to put the work in and they will cover you and treat you right. You got to be willing to put in the work if you want to make a living out of it. Hours suck in winter but are great in spring and summer."
good,It was a good temporary job while I was in school. They were very flexible with my hours and provide good training and advancement opportunities if you want them.
good,Working at Home Depot was amazing being a cashier and working at the service desk just helping out customers was great the dislike of Home Depot is when my hours got dropped
good,"The Home Depot has been an absolute blessing when it comes to being flexible with my school schedule. The pay is above the minimum and they recognize hard work when it's done. At my yearly review, I was rewarded with a good raise along with good praise. Definitely a great place to work as a student"
good,"Over the last year I have been at Home Depot, I have learned a lot about the many options that they have to offer, have made many friends, and have greatly enjoyed my experience there. Many of the other employees have also stayed because of the wonderful management we have at the store I am at in addition to the many coworkers. The only real drawback are the hours. A person has to be willing to work a flexible schedule and in many households, the may not be an issue, however, because of my husbands employment, we are running 2 separate households and I am raising 3 of our 4 young children, making the work schedule difficult to accommodate on some occasions."
good,Best job i have worked in a while. Management was great. Job was easy and manageable. Workplace was well kept. The staff was great too. You could ask them anything and they would help you out especially if you were new. Only complaint is that the higher-ups in the company DO NOT UNDERSTAND what goes on in the specific facility enough to make the right decisions.We had 5 people quit in one month leaving us severely understaffed and all that happened was that we were complained to about stuff not getting done when we COULDN'T.
good,Got hired on making more than my friend who had been working there for 4 years... i told him to quit because what company treats their faithful employees like that?? Job was easy loved to lift heavy things on freight and always was doing something time flew by. Just didn't like how new hires where making more than faithful employees... they should do something about that...
good,A typical day at The Home Depot would depend on what day/time of day you're at work. I learned how to manage money even better than what I already knew.
good,Great place to work. Good work environment. The pay was very pleasing. Able to move up and learn good work habits. This place made you want to get up and go to work.
good,"It is a fun job and there is always something to do."

good,"Home Depot is a great place to work, learn, and grow within the company. You are asked to give great customer service and perform duties that help make the store clean and stocked.

Since being at Home Depot, I have learned how to use my resources when dealing with problems within the store how to provide excellent customer service, and exceeding product knowledge."
good,Offer great benefits and lots of training. Constant career advancement opportunities. Schedule is not consistent and can be a challenge for a family. Best customer service training available!
good,I LOVE working at home depot. although it does get very stressful working at the service desk. its very faced paced. good pay. good benefits. it does give me a lot of anxiety and stress and frustration working at the desk but i think its worth it
good,"It’s a great work environment everybody feels like family "
good,I really did enjoy working at The Home Depot and I am thinking of applying there again. Things were fairly busy during the afternoon when all the contractors would come in and ask for either a full crate of tiles or any other supply. Things moved very fast and the break room was really nice.
good,nice place to work. better get a second job or a full time real job. this job is perfect for college students. management are respectful and good peoples. workers are friendly.
good,This is great place for someone looking for a part time job while still in school or looking for your first job. It does get chaotic only because of the morning or weekend rush.
good,"Good work place, good training and there are always opportunities for advancements. Management was always upbeat and ready to help out. The hardest part of the job would be when you couldn't find that part or tool the customer needed. The most enjoyable would be teamwork and getting the project done your ready to go."
good,I would call this company one of the few that cares about its employees. if you get a position here stay. they have great benefits and plenty room to grow in the company.
good,I need to work more on getting credit cards and leads. I had a rough time a few months back and was late a few times due to what was going on. Now back on track.
good,Company seemed to support and encourage employee achievement. Disappointed that job ended but it was only a summer job. Scheduling was flexible and they keep you busy.
good,"Great work environment, everyone is friendly, as if its a real second family. the work isn't hard once trained correctly. you don't mind coming into work even on your days off, it's a great place to learn the business."
good,i was one of the best worker at the home depot i have all my badges being one of the potencial during my time.. i was very succesful during my career..i was one of the all star customer service
good,"The benefits are great. The company provides a lot of training to its associates.  Challenging because of difficult customers.  I just don't like the working hours, shifts are not fixed making it hard to find a second job."
good,"Home depot is a great place to work but if your a part timer its not so good everything else is good the only problem home depot has its is working hours, home depot working hour is not good at all"
good,"A typical day at work could be described as clocking in going straight to your designated area and simply getting started by unloading the truck or cart in your area. Then after finishing you cart, you clean up and get ready to leave."
good,"Es una empresa con una excelente cultura  hacia el cuidado del trabajador, administracion en manejo de indicadores"
good,"its a busy paced business dedicated to their customers its provides discounts for other places, health care and benefits it also provides a lot of ways for you to get ahead and move up into the company"
good,The Home Depot provides excellent employee benefits that range from insurance up to a 401k which provides company contributions. These benefits are available to part time employees as well
good,Very relaxed. You got together with management to find out what the day was going to be like. You learned something new everyday. It was a fun place to work. We all worked together as a team. Help each other out. That we got to cook for the holidays and even the events we had for the clients that came into the work environment. It was a lot of fun.
good,"As long as SOP was followed, managers where very laid back and went out of their way to help customers and associates EVERYDAY!................................."
good,"Each time i clock in i go to the back get my apron then head back to the department "
good,The environment at home depot is like no other! Definitely a big family that cares for you in and out of the work place! Constantly asking for feedback from associates to improve working experience!
good,"fun to work for the home depot loved the people and co workers helped alot when needed, will like to work there again someday. great opportunity to learn great skills"
good,"Not at all a bad place to work, however personally lacking hours. I work hard and am noticed for it , yet am not able to be promoted due to a over staffed full time crew."
good,I love working at The Home Depot. It has friendly people and great workers. I just don't like the hours. The pay is good but not good enough for me. I would like to work there for a long time if I had full time.
good,"Active job always busy, get to learn and work in different areas not stuck to just one department. Management was super nice and considerate. Benefits were good even for part-time staff"
good,Depending on what department you worked in would depend on your experience.  Receiving/freight was pretty fast paced and way under staffed.  More than enough work to keep you busy and most times you had to work extra hard during any down time to catch up...who am I kidding you never were caught up.  Receiving department was the place that all the other departments liked to dump on and you rely heavily on the Ops manager to have your back and stand behind your decisions.
good,It is a great place to work at and with the learning opportunities and the Perks that Home Depot provides it is a great place to start working which gives events for the employees such as cook outs and raffles for the appreciation for the work that employees do

good,Working in The Home Depot gave me a great deal of experience in time management and customer service. Assisting customers on a daily basis and face to face taught me how to effectively communicate with my co-workers and guest.
good,management was really good however customers are difficult and sometimes don't seem to listen the only great part of the experience had to be the other employees

good,"The hourly wage could of been better. Good overall work, had weekends off. Good set hours. My manger was very organized and thorough on upcoming projects and deadlines."

Can be an overload so its not for someone who  stresses easily, very fast pace environment & customer assistance is a key factor"

good,"I worked at several Home Depots across the country, west coast, east coast, midwest and south.   It was a fun work environment in each store.  The employees are like a second family and i am still in contact with many that I worked with. You can learn any department you want, which will help you with the winter months when hours become scarce.  You learn skills that help in life with home repairs and they often run promos in which they pay you to learn the other departments.  There was always a good work life balance and their benefits are phenomena."
good,one of the happiest and friendliest places I've ever worked! As a cashier there are liberties that you can make that empower your decisions and there's a bit of freedom in that to make the customers happy. The pay isn't ideal but it builds every year and there are incentives to top employees. There's also a lot of room to advance from department to department so you never have to be bored with your job! There are Homer awards that employees give to each other that turn into cash advances; as someone who has worked at two different locations some stores tend to be more generous then others. There are also benefits.
good,"Great place to work at with lots of possibilities to grow. I had set hours from Monday to Friday. Merchandised all new product coming in. Set Displays, helped customers throughout the store."
good,"Smooth and quick paced work "
good,This job requires a lot of strength to lift heavy merchandises. This requires you to be very focus in the task you were given by your supervisors. Co-workers were great
good,The home depot is a great employer. The associates and leadership team are really friendly and outgoing. a lot of team activities and also group meals.
good,"Great place to work, managing your own cash register, making sure everything is in place for great customer sopping experiences."
good,Home Depot worked with my school schedule and there benefits were awesome. Some members of management really want to see a person advance either in life or within the store. Home depot works with their employees. Do expect not to get off in time.
good,I have learned a lot from working at Home Depot. Teamwork as always available in different forms.  Management was always willing to give a lending hand. I like the on job training the they have for the equipment.
good,typical day at work... we start off by unloading the truck with Freight then we sort freight in there correct spot so we can stock them out to the floor. I like the management there they were really helpful when it came to learning about the job. There wasn't anything hard about the job really but the most enjoyable part was getting the truck done...
good,"I love working at THD, it is a fast moving culture with amazing company values and it really represents everything that is right with customer service."
good,"At Home Depot there is always something to work on, projects to do and setting planograms. What I love about working there is that there's a set schedule."
good,As a college student working at home depot is perfect. The company and managers understand that you need time to study. The managers are willing to help you out with anything. My co-workers were also fellow college students.
good,"Great place to work and grow.  A typical day was fast paced for me because I loved helping and advising customers.  Learned something new everyday.  Contractors would educate associates and explain their jobs voluntarily,  and let you know which products worked best for specific jobs."
good,"Working for Home Depot I have gained a lot of skills, such as computer skills, online sales/orders, how to engage with customers by providing excellent customer service. I gained knowledge how to run the returns register, paint department, tool rental, customer service department, and garden."

good,"Take away the poor welfare type hourly wage and this is a great place to work.  Management know about the poor hourly wage and bends over backward to make up for it.  Corporate is horrible, local management is great.  They accommodate you in any way they can to help with your schedule, even if you're part time they treat you with respect and courtesy.  You have the opportunity to learn many things about retail and the Home Depot on line school will easily help you get into management if that's your desire."
good,The job was a little harder because i had to sell a service to people coming in and out of the store who dont really want the service. Overall it was a good job just wasnt right for me
good,Its retail so it has it typical retail days of horrible customers and standard retail qualities but its big boy retail. This means better pay a good atmosphere and they treat you like a human.
good,"The environment is great, parties and meetings are genuinely fun. Management is warm and understanding of personal issues. Scheduling is fair and usually made up to 3 weeks in advance, which is very nice and hours are generally good. Pay is competitive and benefits are as well. All-in-all a great place to work, my only complaint would be the lack of room for advancement. Due to the high number of people who stay past retiring age, I've found that there is little room to advance your position unless you are making a life long commitment to the company. That being said, students can cross train in different departments for more hours, which is also nice."
good,"I loved working at Home Depot. I started out as Cashier which I totally loved, then put in for a position called Bay Integritity which is where you go around in your designated areas to see what was out of stock, we would change prices. That had great hours 5:00am to 10:00am. Then I decided I wanted to go full time so I joined what they called the Met team. To me that was a glorified janitors job. We had to clean each bay, move merchandise. I wasn't crazy about that job at all."
good,"good job, retail, easy, and learn some. the customer was ok. no problem with customers. need better managers. can always learn there"
good,This job is fun and rewarding and a very professional work environment. Management can ride you a little but it is for the sake of the business. the hardest part of the job would be dealing with angry customers. Co-workers all work together and treat each other as family.The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy with their help and their purchasing decisions.
good,"Excellent Team Members and Good working environment to work with , the management is supportive and have flexible working hours and the company truly follows what they state in their DNA."
good,Home Depot is a great company. I just wish they were able to provide full time work. This a good company. They are will known and have a lot of benefits.
good,"Learning the in and outs of Pro Sales in a fortune 500 company has helped me improve my knowledge in the business world. Teaching me how important it is to put the customer first. Also, how important team moral can be to the bottom line. All the while improving my decision making skills in a fast moving environment."

good,I would start my day by clearing the lot of carts and bringing the large lumber carts inside for customer use. I would keep the lot clear throughout the day and help customers load as needed. Most job skills related are based on securing a large load to a vehicle for safe travel. The management team in smart and helpful and will work with you if you need anything. All of my coworkers are friendly ad helpful. The hardest part of the job is loading 200+ bags of concrete in three hours. The most enjoyable part is the people.

good,"They really want you to succeed, however they do not tolerate not being punctual. They want people who want to work hard, not talk to there friends"
good,"Come in and sign out a lift, pick up assignments and start working."
good,This job is pretty nice for people who are new to the warehouse field. You get to learn lots of new processing techniques and ways to make your work load easy for the day
good,I am currently looking for full time as I am getting married this November.
good,"The Home Depot is an awesome place to work, You are afforded every opportunity to grow with the company, as I started as a Part Time Cashier at 7.50hr, and completed my career as a Store Manager for 9 years ending base rate salary of $109K.  I have a lot of Home Depot Stock that I purchased through the Employee Purchase Plan, and support the company and stay in touch with many of my peersl."

good,"A typical day can begin at 5am, you walk your department and make sure that the shelf are stock if the product is available. Customers are a priority so if you are doing something your job is to go assist and stay with customer until they have what they need, if the should need professional advice than you assist and sell all things required. This benefits the customer and companies profit At the Home Depot I learned to lead by example, as a supervisor its important that you have the respect of your employees in order to be able to manage a department. I also learn to sell by make suggestions and sharing my ideas with the customer. The hardest part of the job is that it physically demanding, their is a lot of lifting and moving around. Greatest part about the job was working with people, learning and developing abilities that you may not know you posses. Management does a great job in empowering people to make decisions that make a person feel important."
good,great company to work for at a wide range of age groups as well as culture. outstanding benefits no matter fulltime or part time
good,Typical day at work would be productive as well as fun and always a learning experience.

good,"I really enjoyed working at Home Depot. My coworkers were friendly and helpful (both toward me and the customers), my supervisor was great, and the pay and benefits were better than most cashier jobs. I started at $8.75 and got a raise to $9.25 after 90 days. The scheduler was very accommodating; if I needed a day off she always gave it to me as long as I gave enough notice."
good,Management/Co-workers were always corteous. The environment was always safe to work in.
good,"A typical day at work was interesting.  It was actually helpful for a professional and personal setting.  BY helping customers i could also figure out different ideas i could use for my own home one day.

I review any items that may be needed to be stocked on the shelves to assure customers availability for those items. As I go through the day, I attend to the customers needs as they arise, helping the cutomer to better understand which product or products will serve them best to complete their project. Also trying to make sure that the aisles are clear from any clutter to keep a safe working environment for our associates as well as the customers who shop there. I'll interact with other departments and even other Home Depot stores to stisfy the cutomers needs. As in anything, you get back what you put in. Working here has given me a sense of selfworth knowing that when I finish with my customer, I can look forward to that customer comming back again if they ever need to. The best part is that even in a fast pace world, the people I work with make me smile every day, even when the preesure is on. I know I can work together with my co workers and my management team, whith out feeling inadequate. They take the time to bring their co workers through any rough situation helping resolve those hard to fix projects. At the end of a shift, I can find myself still smiling, even if I'm tired."

good,"I enjoyed working here for a summer/student job. There was an unlimited amount of training that was offered, and helpful resources that were within reach to learn more about your company, your business, and your job. There was definitely great room for advancement, and I was encouraged to get all the experience I could to better my knowledge in the business, and therefore bettering the service and help we provide to our customers."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot is a busy day working and dealing with contractors and handing big money. Working there I honestly gained experience within cashier positions,phone sales and learning more about each department. The hardest part would have to be learning each individual skua number inside the store. The most enjoyable part is when all the customers recognize you and meeting new people everyday ."
good,"got knowledge of lots retailer products, good co - worker support, many cultural activities "
good,"I enjoy working there people are very helpful "
good,"Customer layout, order processing and follow up. Industry product knowledge as Kraftmaid, American Woodmark, Mills Pride, specifications and selection, kitchen & bath fixtures and accessories. Retail operations, customer service skills, software 20/20."
good,great job great people i love working at homedepot
good,Customers first
good,get the job done easy working with other co-workers hardest part is when boxes get jammed up and it stops everybody at their doing
good,"Love working for my management team, always in communication to succeed. Start of day if no appt set, are notes! Update with follow through, info, payments,answers to questions to get customer projects complete. Check for safety issues, stock shelves, greet all customers and solve their project needs. Work as a team to complete all tasks. If any spare time (?) work on learning classes. Keep area clear of clutter and help in neighboring departments."
good,i love working at home depot. they have great benefits. awesome management
good,"Started off as a cashier for the front end and returns, where I had a daily till. I enjoyed doing that! Before I resigned, I was an Asset Protection Specialist, where I performed daily safety walks, apprehended subjects stealing, and processed police reports. Worked closely with managers."
good,"I started at Home Depot as a part time Flooring Associate and within 9 days they promoted me to Pro Paint Sales 40 hours per week. I worked hard and was promoted 3 more times in 1 year! Thats a good company if you ask me:) I left Home Depot for a personal tragedy in the family and did not return ( wish I would have). Well, all in all, they are a fantastic place to work and maybe I will be back there soon. Great opportunity to advance yourself without a bunch of micro managers breathing down your neck. The management is very good and give you ALL the training you need to succeed.......Give it a shot, you will be glad you did!"
good,It's the worse company to work for. There no appreciation for hard work. They have to much of a click going on. It's who you know. They discriminate against older people. People of color. The whole management needs to change. The store needs to close. Re vamp the store.
good,Above all it wasn't the best job and it wasn't the worst job but it was my first job I took pride at working at Home Depot it wasn't very fun there I had to pick up a lot of slack that others employees wasn't picking up on everybody depended on me cuz I was a pro loader that's where i over worked my self i had to think im still young by living on my own i saw the world for what it really is a pit in you have too work vary hard to get what you want
good,"If they really cared about their employees and not their profits, they could easily be one of the greatest places to work for and people wouldn't mind making a career there."
good,Es buena ya q hay mucha fluides de gente y es muy dinamica la empresa
good,same as last one. No need to same anymore. I already reviewed. This company is okay to work for just wish it was better pay and more flexible with the hours and definitely help those out with who have families that they cant spend time with. I really do not like working all these weekends.
good,Pretty busy job that keeps you on your feet. Still able to enjoy work at the same time. Employees and customers are awesome and easy to get along with
good,training program was excellent. Success of a dept was not dependent on valuable information from associates determined from upper management. Work schedule was non negotiable.
good,This has been one of the best jobs I've had I recommend applying if you are looking for something steady/hands on pay is fair with many opportunities in hours and advancements within the company good job
good,"Slow paced, horrible management, the pay wasn't enough to live on. Too much work place gossip and drama. They hire people that would rather sit around then work."
good,The Company was good to work for loved the constant daily tasked but as you get up in management your daily life schedule gets reduced no time for family.
good,"learned many DIY projects"
good,"Cashier, Lot Attendant"
good,Supervisor had favoritisms toward some employees and friends and employees and if you wasn’t in the club you were screwed and it did no good to complain to company H R they just reported it back to them and supervisor made your life unbearable
good,I’ve worked at Home Depot for two years and when people asked me if I liked working there I’d always say “I like it enoug not to quit” but now my life is changing in many ways and Home Depot more or less will not provide what I need. The pay is good if you’re a teenager or a full time associate. Outside of that you’re pretty much drowning if you’re trying to make a life for yourself with a part time position. For being your basic retail job they really stress you out. But it’s different for everybody of course.
good,Es una empresa seria con mucha disposición para crecer y mantener un equipo de trabajo bien organizado
good,the management was overall bad they didn't have good standing with their employees. if anyone wanted to learn a new department they would say yes but take forever to grant them their wishes.
good,"Sucks as a work place "
good,Workers talk about each other. They do not have respect for each other there. They also are constantly acussing each other of stealing from the lockers.
good,It was a great place to work with bonus for employees who exceeded in great customer service. I enjoyed learning new things in the garden area about different flowers and the seasons that they grew in . I even developed a great team leader by helping out in different departments when needed.
good,"I loved working here, sadly for me it was only seasonal. The management who were present were very fair. Like all places you have good management and some not so great."
good,Home depot is a large company with great opportunities. I have grown on so many levels in retail
good,A great place to learn more about gardening. Great learning opportunity with wonderful coworkers.
good,I would like to work part time and I feel that this company would be an exciting and awarding position.
good,"I excel at this job.  As a salesperson I was extemely concerned with problem solving, customer service and product knowledge.  My last review was excellent but due to the cutting of part time hours, I am forced to look for employment elsewhere."
good,"I designed kitchen with cabinets and countertops.  That, obviously, took time to actually create on the computer.  If I was at my desk, designing and/or creating a possible $40-$50 THOUSAND job, Management only saw me at my desk, ""playing on the computer"" and would make me work in the paint dept, or any other dept in the building.  They not only didn't understand, they didn't WANT to understand.  Plumbing dept could sell 2 or 3 $100 toilets, and kitchen design could sell $50,000 kitchen, or maybe 2!  Management had no clue.  It was hard to work for them.  I did, however, LOVE the job and the people I sold to,  Just not management."
good,At the Home Depot i am currently working at they overwork you and have no interest if you get rest or not. Also i feel as though they should pay more considering that the Home Depot is a multi million dollar company
good,"a typical day at work would be either on the sales floor or driving the forklift all day, stocking shelves.management was very poor, my manager was lost half the time or would be in a different department."
good,"Homedepot used to be a good place to work, now they wanna pay you a starving wage and wants more from you and all managers is bias and terrible work hours"
good,"the Home Depot rules and job community is awesome in paper, however, Management seems to take on the ""good ol boy"" synergy totally different from the Corporate Training Videos  - so basically, in theory the corp plan is awesome, just not so much when it comes down to ensuring the managers follow thru."
good,"Part-time associates do receive some benefits, so I suggest using this company as a stepping stone to something  more permanent. You get insight into how a big, box store is run and have opportunities to learn about a great variety of products you didn't even know where out there."
good,"Home Depot is a great Corporation, just not in East Texas. RACISM!!! I had never experienced that in my life, it was  earth shattering to my my world!"
good,i been there for almost 2 years but my manager is a horror story he should and could be better at his Job if he wasn't a stick in the mud and a pain in the neck and sleeping while on the job almost every night
good,"Special Service Representative is were I placed orders for customers answered calls pertaining to customer service, promoted store credit cards and also worked as a switchboard operator"
good,I don't like working her it really sucks being around a lot of lazy people who doesn't like to do there job it's almost like the hire anybody really need better managers
good,If you want to be a slave to the orange koolaid go right ahead. I suggest not being in customer care at all. I'm sure all the people who truly loved coming to work are salaried and don't have to work in customer care at all!!! Other than that the culture of the company was cool (away from customer care)!!!
good,"Home Depot is known as the place of constant change.  They go through many transitions of changing positions, and laying off people.  While it is a very close ""family environment"" you never know if your job will be here today or not."
good,"Worked as cashier and special service desk I learned to deal with customers management where good, easy to talk to, change my schedule was easy   I enjoyed some of my co-workers"
good,"Thumbs up, very busy , very boring after 2pm during the wk, managers were ok  co-workers were are awesome nd some were Extremely Lazy !!!!!!"
good,"Always busy. I was trained on loss prevention, shrinkage how to manage customer accts and how to drive fork lift and other equipment, etc. The management should, however, take a couple courses in professionalism and just how to treat employees better. They should also learn how to see when they have a good egg and when they don't. The heat is the hardest part and the lifting. The education, the customers, the family-like co workers were the most enjoyable."
good,"You experience it all with every customer, employees are the best there."
good,Nice health benefits. Its a good place to learn about home projects
good,"Our management team is horrible . The only way to move up , is to know people and get in good with the managers , they regconize the same people . No matter how hard someone may work , they simply over look you if you make one mistake . the hardest part of my job is getting to a higher level , and getting paid for it ."
good,Working at Home Depot was fun because I was able to learn a lot of different things. I feels as if I can built my own house now.Thank you HD for the experience.
good,"Overall this company is great, Store # 6516 goes above and beyond for the customers, but not there employees. A typical day at work consisted of paperwork, assisting customer and operating a register."
good,Comme inscris dans le résumé très bonne entreprise mais l’expérience Est rendue amère par la  direction
good,"Constant pace always busy"
good,poor management in district and promoting unqualified people to salary positions. Not enough people in stores to properly run them. Business is going to online.
good,"upbeat job  with lots of engaging physical activity ,under a very structured Co environment, with extreme and extended online training."
good,"The management within this company sucks. It's dog eat dog world here, and the pay is horrible. No one is held accountable in this company everything is put on the night crew!"
good,"home depot showed me that age is nothing but a number, great work experiences and i got my license to operate different types of machines, i also learned alot about home make overs and decors."
good,Working for HD is fine if you do not want a social life or want to have family time. Hours were horrible. Only positive thing were health the benefits.
good,"A typical day at work is very busy and interesting I spend the majority of my time pulling orders and driving the forklift . What I learned is how the business works and how to interact with customers, including operating heavy machinery. The management  at the Home Depot has its good days and bad days. But a majority of those days tend to be bad with scheduling the workers and even giving out a fair amount of hours. Some managers are amazing, because I am in school and they tend to work with my school schedule but they would still work me on hours I could not come to work because of my classes. The work place culture is amazing , getting along with one another is fantastic but a majority of the co-workers are leaving because  there is not enough hours being given and the management is not up to par. The hardest part of my job was to pull orders for customers in a certain amount of time but also be available to walk and help a customer when needed, sometimes I wouldn't get the chance to finish orders on time cause of the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was just to be able to come in and work"
good,"The home depot that I worked at was not managed well.  In fact the employees actually managed the store."
good,"Had an awesome time for 11 and so years in a fantastic work environment. Learned retail strategy and was awarded quite well."
good,"Going into the job, with no prior knowledge of home improvement or power tools, or lumber. I not only learned new things, but I also had fun doing it. The customers were very nice, and the people I worked with where very kind."
good,It was a i like it but it was also a temporary position through a staffing agency. The management was very nice i was respknsible for stocking the merchandise for the store to open in the mornings.
good,"I was a shoe in for the job, but I dont feel as if I was trained accordingly for every job they had me attepmting to do, I did not waste time to let them know, I tried to let them know about the distance and me taking public transportaion wouldnt have me there at the times they were trying to schedule me"
good,The job is great but the culture is often skewed. The CEO and high ranking leadership often visit the sites and don't ensure they meet the hourly associates our site supervisors.
good,Working at the Home Depot has been a blessing and a curse.  I work with a lot of great people who care about what they do.  They go out of their way to help when needed.  The senior management could care less about you or your quality of life.
good,This was by far one of the more enjoyable jobs I've had. Very relaxed environment yet still professional. Friendly staff that was very inviting and full of knowledge.
good,"I loved working for home Depot as a company, but the managers and department heads are unappreciative and selfish. They expect more than your job requirements state and don't compensate for any of it. You could work yourself to death and never get ahead in the company. It seems like the ones who did nothing always were the management favorites!"
good,"Started working on the sales floor, then learned more and more and finished as a department manager of flooring. I learned a lot about flooring to the point that I will never have to hire anyone to lay flooring in my home again as I can do it myself which it the reason and vision of home depot."
good,"Customer service oriented.  All places of employment although under the same corporate entity have their own rules that they work by.  Management shows partiality, sometimes to the point of discrimination.  The co-workers are okay.  The hardest part of my job was being force to accept the things that were going on in the work place due to the poor managerial staff.  Leaving was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Good company but for me only if its for extra money or a part time job. I nees more qualities to excel
good,the bad thing about this job is that you would do your job to the best of your ability and the supervisor would still have a problem with how things were done
good,Collected carts throughout the store parking lot and moved them to the correct place for customers. I learned a lot of self motivating skills. How to socialize with other employees. Management could have been a little better organized in my opinion. Hardest part of the job would be loading heavy product for customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a satisfied customers reaction.
good,"I am working, love my co workers. Management does not care about the employee."
good,"working part time, traveling locations, merchandising products "
good,Very rarely get on full time. Low pay supervisor don’t work and will not help. Will let lazy ones get buy with not doing there job. And does not bother them to see one doing all the work as long as it gets done.
good,"Very fast paced and demanding if you work Lumber or Garden you are very busy. "
good,Working at Home Depot is ok. The coworkers are helpful and it’s a good company to be part of. It offers a great benefits plan and the 401k is flexible with how you contribute into it.
good,"I would recommend someone to work here, but the overall management isn’t great and most of them didn’t honor most of the companies policies. But the people are very kind and very great people overall."
good,It's an amazing place to work the management SUCKS but outside of that you will love it. It's fast paced and eazy to learn new things if you want. Overall I love it
good,"Evaluo el trabajo de 10 puntos, mas no a la gerencia"
good,I loved working their you could learn a lot in one building. The customers are amazing. It’s a family type of work environment.. everyone helps everyone .. all you have to do is ask
good,"A typical night would start off with a brief meeting with night manager and entire overnight team to assign departments or give updates on tasking responsibilities."
good,"Fun sometimes , for the most part it was an ok job. Wasn’t really fast paced I was bored a lot . But I had my own space and work area. They would provide food sometimes and have parties for us as well. The Christmas party was great."
good,The home Depot family will help you as much as possible. They is well involved in the neighborhoods near by. They make the workers feel like they at home.
good,"I enjoy working at Home Depot. The number of  hours per week is inconsistent, however. A positive is that you can wear jeans and the atmosphere is basically casual. "
good,a typical day at work for most of the time was eventful it has its ups and downs and sometimes fun as well but must keep your guard up with co-workers
good,the experience was great but the way they are with there promotions and elevation to a better position is not what I expected they can do better......
good,i loved working there. helping customers but underpaid for the amount of work i was required to do and treated as if i was disposable and easily replaceable. managers treat you like trash
good,"Working for Home Depot is not the best. Can never find management  and its really frustrating when you find them on their phones surfing Facebook in the back office while you need help. Half the time management is no wear to be found and the schedules are so inconsistent and they do not try to help you balance your work life.    their are a few people in management who do try to help and the HR lady is very helpful but sadly all but two ASMS are just not their to do their job, just collect a pay check and leave."
good,A typical day at work was always hectic. You never run out of things to do. I was able to learn how to work many pieces of equipment. The hardest part of the job was finding places to put all the over stock.
good,"Its a decent place to work.. Some days its slow, other days its jamming. Either way its honest work and they will teach you if you are willing to learn."
good,"repacking ,doing inventory .,Hard work don't mind "
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Homedepot. Only thing that made it bothersome was the store manager. He would cut your hrs, if you didn't do what he ask. For example, he cut a coworkers of mines hrs because they didn't want to stay over because they had school in the morning, which I don't blame them. The store manager ruled with an iron fist and that made the work atmosphere horrible. Besides that, it was a good place to work."
good,"had a very easy to learn training program made it easy to start work, and the managers were very helpful  in all situations. policies are clear and safety is enforced ."
good,"Outstanding company, especially programs they have set up ""behind the scenes"" to help employees having home life difficulties.  Outstanding Management at corporate level.  Store management leaves a huge hole.  My experience under store managers started outstanding, but each time a new manager was installed, things got progressively worse for employees.  By the time I left, about 85% of my stores' employees were trying to leave because of store managers lack of respect for them.  And while I hate to say it, it appeared to start with the installation of a new Regional Manager.  The company really needs to investigate this.  Its tragic at a company with such a sterling reputation.  Advice to job seekers, talk to current employees before hiring on, I am assuming each store differs."
good,"No Review at this time, It was just a job with no future for advancment. This was a company that had no team work, the more that you did, the more co-workers expected"
good,"A typical day is fast paced, constant calls , multiple questions that I have answers too. I learned alot about troubleshooting and having patience. My co- workers were nice, but my managers seemed like it wasn't enough time in the day. The hardest part of the job was letting/listening to people vent and can't say anything."
good,Duties as follows: Matching labels with products; separating products on conveyor belt/multiple conveyors simultaneously; building/stacking pallets; unload trailers; lift/carry up to 75 lbs.; operated handheld scanner; maintained a clean and safe environment; maintain a fast and steady production.
good,I spent most of my day facing products and helping customers with any questions or concerns they had about their projects. I learned a great deal about building materials and lumber. Management was not great there. Tons of micromanaging and lots of misunderstandings as to what we are supposed to do and what was expected. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of knowing you helped any and all of a customers projects come to fruition.
good,I liked working as a waitress meeting new people everyday my coworkers were awesome
good,the management wasn't that great... but overall...it was ok
good,"Work life / Balance can be a pain when in management you live in the building you work in. "
good,fun and challengin fast pace enviroment learn about all kind of projects and tools
good,Data input information from home inspector. I've learned so many details that are involved as an inspector and what is actually looked for in a home for insurance purpose. The hardest part of the job is knowing the difference between different materials that are used in building a home or a workplace.
good,well a great company to work for would have like to been permanant
good,Great for a first job. Hard to progress there though. it was a favoritism thing. great company though
good,salir a visitar los clietes comerciales hacer cotizaciones
good,This is a great place to work. You are rewarded for hard work. Great training and a family type environment. They have been able to give me the hours I need.
good,"Love my job and the people I work for, I have learned so much being here I am a stronger and more knowledgeable in the area of flooring  I feel very confident in my ability to"
good,"Although it would be good to get more hours, the pay is well for the amount of work you do..I am a cashier..and I don’t dis enjoy my job st all. When everyone is full of good vibes, it puts everyone working and the customers in a good mood."
good,"Flexible hours, good people to work with. You must be able to stand on your feet for long periods of time. Must be able to lift heavy things, and able to climb ladders."
good,"I started as a Customer Service Representative but learned Cashier, worked in Appliances, cut blinds, cut glass, cut wood. I was trained to do everything in the store except mix paint. I enjoyed working there until management changed."
good,"The stores in Knoxville and in Chicago were fantastic. The store location in Harahan, LA was the worst. Poor work ethic was almost encouraged across the board. That was the ONLY reason I left."
good,ASDS Position theres no room for growth and rcuiring staff was very hard beause we start people at minimum wage.There is a very high turn over because of low pay.
good,"Home Depot has been a great company to work for, great benefits, stock options,401k  etc. We have onsite preschool/ daycare, We have tuition reimbursement, cleaners, gym , Starbuck's, bank , and a great selection of lunch Items."
good,"Little to no management , Building falling apart, lack of structure, employees have no care,  you won’t even think it’s a Home Depot company, Stay away"
good,The Home Depot as a whole is a great place to work. As a normal associate you make a lot of great friends and if your there long enough you start to see them more as family because of the culture the home depot exudes. The problem arises at the store manager level. if your store manager is not great at their job the morale in the store is low and vise versa. Moving up can be simple or complicated depending on the store. some store managers promote there friends and some promote based off of performance.
good,"Real management and management people skills non-existent. Computer learning ridiculous: waste of time. Hence, everybody is on their own and that's it!"
good,"Found this a hard place to work, i have great customer skills and can't stand when employs avoid the customers. I found my self very busy with people that other employs did not want to help."
good,"I have worked for this company 14+ years. Management is everything, work ethic and the workplace culture is everything. After transferring from one store to another. The training and work ethics I came with were not appreciated at the new store. It finally took its toll on my career at the Depot. I had to leave. Hurts."
good,"Loved working for Home Depot, except when your told to come in on your day off. I don't care that you have plans with your family, I need you to help set seasonal. That was the last straw as it happened way to often."
good,"I like working at Home Depot I learned a lot about the company that I did not know.  Working environment was great.  People friendly, Management was understanding if you had a situation.  Really had fun especially at Thanksgiving and Christmas. Production was easy to meet especially if you can type 10,000 key stokes which was required."
good,"It was a great environment. Just part-time and I needed full-time. I excelled immediately and talks began to try and keep me, but not full-time though."
good,"I enjoyed helping my team grow and give them the proper tools to do so."
good,"They provide a nice break room with a food pantry for those who forget lunch."
good,Easy going job field with good help.  I thought  the breaks were fair and the work load was acceptable.  I enjoyed the work ethic of others around me.
good,"The Home Depot of El Paso is a great place for School bound young adults. Its a great place to continue to develop leadership, computer and documentation skills."
good,Helping customers with things they need to do  a project. It's a great place to work. I always tell people to apply there for work.
good,"it is a face paced environment where customer service has the highest value placed on it. I enjoy the customer interactions and being able to help people. the hardest part of the job is that the task load can sometimes seem overwhelming, but having a supportive management and team staff is extremely helpful."
good,"I sell, educate customers on instore products. I'm open-minded and always willing to help my fellow associates and cutomers.  I enjoy eduated others and helping them suceed.  "
good,I worked as a cashier with nice customers. Co-worker and management were very helpful. The most enjoyable part were the customers getting to help and enjoy talking with them
good,"Great experience working in this store. Although located in Alabama. The customers were always splendid."
good,Loved working there until the management team changed. After that I left the company because everything became difficult when it really shouldn't be.
good,"School life, personal life and work life does not balance well with the scheduling."
good,"The work is good, the people.are great I enjoy working for Home Depot and have learned many things about the retail industry"
good,"home depot is a great place to work. It is a fast paced environment, i work alongside some fantastic people. Customer service is a major part of my job, as a manage the cahiers throughout the day i also handle any issues that customers have within the store. The hardest part of my job is separating work and friends."
good,"experienced a high volume store,interacted with customers very well and employees."
good,Helping customers each day on their projects .Great  employees to work with. Management is wonderful. Home Depot is a good company to work for
good,"When I was hired on I was told to expect to work between 18 and 26 hours a week, my biggest week was 15 hours. When hired you hear that The Home Depot hires from within and you can move up rather quickly, every time I inquired about cross-training I was shot down without an explanation why."
good,Just loved everything about it and a little sad im no longer employed with them
good,"I left this position when instead of giving their current part time employees hours, they continued to hire new people instead. Some weeks I was scheduled for zero hours. I decided I needed to find another positon somewhere else."
good,"Cannot advance with this company,too many employees for samr position,I made supervisor"
good,"Basically unloaded trailers and broke down loads by different zip codes. i learned alot about the different aspects of the warehousing industry. Management was pretty nice, sometimes got free lunch and the overtime was almost unlimited, the hours were a little long usually 5PM-4AM it would definitely be tiring day after day but it was worth it. I enjoyed the overtime and management."
good,"Lack of advancement opportunities. Unappreciated work. I was looking for advancement and asked what I could do to achieve this. I was told through reviews that I was ""in line"" for advancement, but this never came. Then the director of personal quit, along with the management staff. They jumped ship!"
good,"I learned alot about landscaping, managing others, and a variety of outside materials. I started as a lot engineer, next garden associate, associate coach, then a key carrier, and finally became dept. head of outside garden. The hardest part of the job was ordering merchandise for inventory prep. The most enjoyable part of the job was watching the customers leave with smiles on their faces and how the co-workers came to me for advice on projects."
good,like the work enviroment
good,"the job atmosphere was great as far as employee relations. the managers can kind of take away from the feeling of being family oriented. its a good job, very stable and there are chances for you to advance in the company. i enjoyed my time there and i would recommend this job to everyone who inquires."
good,"I like the area, great employee, helpful, friendly  "
good,I love working there and am part time but I get extra hours all the time to give me 25 to 30 hours a week.  I need to get more consistent hours to give me every week
good,Good Job for someone looking for an retail job. Reasonable pay for what it is and a good place to learn and develop skills. Flexible hours and many locations.
good,"the most enjoyable part about the job is to watch the costumers go home/work with smiles on his/her face. "
good,Provided new challenges and experiences while working at 2 locations for Home Depot.  Enjoyed providing excellent customer service for consumers and contractors at Home Depot.
good,It is good pay and benefits. The hours are very good. They have room for advancement if the worker is doing well. I recommend this job to anyone who wants to be successful.
good,"Strong corporate culture. Company overall is great. Some departments are less enjoyable than others."
good,Would enjoy for my kids to work there while going to school. You can connect and interact with a lot of people here. I honestly wish they payed more so people can live off this income alone.
good,"Started in garden dept. Accepted position as lead generator. Worked with all home services offered at home depot. Position eliminated and went to appliance dept. Currently working as appliance specialist. "
good,Company can should offer more training for new hires employees prior to assigning to a department. Benefits are better than many other retail companies.  Increase in hourly wage is most concern of employees working in company business units.
good,i had a great time working there the associates were very nice and helpful; management was good if you needed help somebody was always around to help me
good,I loved what did while I was at Home Depot. Sometimes Corporate Management would put on a BBQ for the employees if certain criteria was met. Bonuses periodically.
good,"great place to work, worked with me so I could get my college degree. It was nice to be able to help the customers find the products they were looking for and I also learned a few things while there about gardening and home improvement."
good,I worked there for 2 years part time and it was a great experience as for my first job. You learned so many things which is great. They do work with your schedule if you go to school.
good,"The Home Depot was a good place to work. I was a cashier so all I was did was help people check out. I never got to fiddle with tools or learn how appliances work, but it was okay."
good,Worked part time.  Liked working with the customers.  Friendly place to work.  No benefits and hard to get hired on full time.  Great for extra job.  Need to pay more hourly.
good,At the location I worked at everyone from the Store Manager down was extremely friendly and made it feel like a family and not just a job.  Only a few bad apples there (Ie: the departments supervisor at the Service desk.)
good,"Buen empleo, interaccion entre los asociados para conocer poco mas como finciona la empresa"
good,Had a great experience there met awesome people and customers good management team benefits could be better raises could be better as well ***********
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was the regular customers and installers that  i interacted  with on a daily basis that took the time to thank you for going above and beyond for them
good,"Used to be a good company to work for. Little to no advancement opportunities now. Senior leadership behind the times and are too comfortable with their positions. "
good,When I worked there the home Depot warehouse was a lot of hard work something that I couldn't handle only because I was struggling at that job and I couldn't do it anymore so I left but I tried it out but I couldn't do it
good,It’s good to work for them but if you want to advance you might as well apply for another store. I never saw somebody advance in my store they always had to leave and if they wanted to come back in a higher position they could.
good,"Very positive work  atmosphere, fun and positive coworker interaction, excellent training provided, always something to do, sense of honor because you never ""milk the clock""."
good,Like life its what you make of it...Company is fantastic...Culture is great! But it is after all retail! if you are willing to be a self starter and learn on the go it is a great place to be...you need to be a strong individual contributor!! Also understanding home improvement and be a people person will lower stress and help in your growth.
good,los asociados no tienen la actitud de servicio y son poco tolerantes
good,"Great company to work for but , high demanding on work hours , they don’t care about you and what u bring to the business daily .you can be replaced any day ,if you make a mistake ."
good,"Great coworkers, bad management and scheduling procedures.  It can be stressful due to lack of employees and no help from the management team.  It is also unfair the way vacation requests constantly get denied even when submitted 90 days in advance."
good,my job was mostly loading mulch and stone into customers vehicles and i have never encountered so many rude/lazy people not a job for the meek i would only suggest this job to the strong minded and athletic with a good strong back because it is a lot like slavery. That being said the co-workers have a great understanding of each other and we all helped each other out with filling positions as each of us gets tired. i would say co-workers really made the job manageable with out a good crew that job would have just been terrible.
good,"I loved helping people , but not enough employees to help out customers, the benefits  are great ..But the take to much money for them ..........................."
good,Like any other retail store except staff actually care about the customers. The work environment was clean and the employees were well trained. They were also kept up to date with changing policies.
good,Working at the home depot taught me a lot. I loved my work place with the exception of how bias the management team was. Management has since been moved around and there is now a new team. Overall a great working place.
good,Although pay wasn't great they did treat you very well and gave you gifts for your hardwork.everyone is generally friendly and there is room for advancement if you'd like
good,"Not a bad place to work, but not a fun place to work either. Basically just a job. I was a cashier for the self checkout, it was very stressful at times. They did make sure you were trained, which was nice."
good,"Great job and company to work for, a lot of the management need work on how to treat there employees. Not a lot of room to move up or get more hours unless you call in all the time then you seem to get what you want"
good,A single person can not survive on what they pay. But I enjoyed my job and particularly working with the customers. Fast paced. Employees discussed how we were just thrown in there and had to learn alot ourselves after we hit the floor.
good,"It's great as a part time gig.  Expect a ton of work for what they pay.  Typically the workers are paid more than supervisors because the supervisors are new.  Work you hard, sometimes you feel appreciated"
good,"The overall work environment was good, but co-workers made it too difficult to remain in my position at Home Depot. ..................................."
good,"I was working here as a 2nd job to support my family. it was a fun and interesting job,  I enjoyed it. the only bad thing about it was that I was only getting 7 hours to 12 hours a week which was not helping my needs. I took this job to better my situation and the hours was not helping me."
good,"At Home Depot you never know what to expect when you walk through the doors of the store. Some days you could be swamped with orders, and questions, whereas there may be others when you the store is a drought. However working with people who offer a since of family makes the days better"
good,"* Helping customers if they have any questions on house hold products."
good,"It's a great work environment for employees to learn a lot of trade skills. I learned how to drive a forklift, I have great relationships with my customers and management makes the job a little easier because of the the guidance."
good,Home Depot doesn't pay great and most all employees are part time but management is supportive and you get the opportunity to help people on a daily basis which I really enjoyed.
good,"Call center environment where we manage 455,000 employees nationwide, where we assist store leaders with interpretation of policy, and discuss discipline for associates based on policy, by conducting thorough investigations, gathering facts reviewing corporate compliance when needed."
good,"The company is overall ok. The management is awful. No work "
good,"Great place to work. Family oriented work environment, Great Customer Service. Also great benefits. Overall You would love the experience working and or Shopping At the Home Depot."
good,Coca Cola was a great paying job I learned a lot about history of the family business this job was one of best one I've had in a long time
good,"A day at work for me was  to work with the contractors in ordering product, making sure orders was correct for shipping, and checking out customers in a timely matter. My co-workers were always helpful and courteous to customers, as well as the managers and supervisors."
good,I enjoyed working there. It was a lot of hard work but at the end of the day I was tired. I also enjoyed the other employees. I would never go back. Management was terrible.
good,"great place to work but if you are temporary you better be looking for a back up job because they don't keep temporaries, other wise the job is great with lots of challenges and great people to work with"
good,fun company to work for they show they care for you and your personal life friendly coworkers and managements great environment
good,"fast pace, learned a lot of receiving duties, co workers are very nice and friendly, receiving goods in a short span of time and lack of space to put the goods, accomplishing the days work"
good,"Typical day at work me and my coworkers work hard and try to get everything done that we need to as a team.I learned that working together can be better then work independently,Hardest part of the job was carrying a lot of stuff but we got it done perfect."
good,Working for the Home Depot is a great experience. Interacting with the customers and making sure that they leave happy and come back to shop with the Home Depot again and again.
good,"Expect more for less pay. Always complain about not meeting store profits , therefor the managers and supervisors cram on the associates. Training is poor , they tend to hire people with interest in the job to begin with."
good,"Home depot is a fast pace environment in terms of customer service.  Customer service is number one and so are sales."
good,"Busy, great co-workers.  Learn to be more self-motivated, management team very helpful. The hardest part of the job was the heat. Enjoy being able to help the customers."
good,A challenge every day to make a living being a commissioned sales consultant. No support from corporate office and local DM's in the stores. Staff in store does not know much of the services or really cares. We cannot do any signage in store. No advertising on the at home services program. Being in Northeast with bad winters makes it a challenge to make money.
good,"Friendly and safe enviorment. The employees, including management treat each other equally. Really miss it. It is a GREAT company to work for. You can excel quickly, your pay rate goes up when they see how well you are doing. It is an awesome place if you like tools."
good,"The Home Depot is a good retail job with opportunities for those willing to take them. For full time workers there is no set schedule, making balancing work and social life difficult at times. But many different departments and training opportunities available to those who express enough interest."
good,its ok i guess the managers could be more involved the managers show favoritism towardfs the employees and they are very rude an unprofessional when it comes to certain situations and altercations
good,"work schedule 5am to 130pm"
good,"Amazing place for advance. Fun atmosphere to work in, managers are as leaders and friends."
good,I was happy to be working at Home Depot it was such a positive environment. The Managers there were all such happy people and so were most of the employees. The hardest part of the job was the fact that there wasn't enough hours offered. The best part of the job was I got to work with so many different types of people.
good,"nice place productive"
good,"Great products, but expensive. Excellent installation and customer service. Lousy schedule if you like to be free evenings and weekends. They pay 10% commission as fast as they can get it in your hands, but there's no expense reimbursement. The sales run in cycles.  You could miss a payday.  There is a butt load of driving, so you could be paying to do this job.  Manager in Dallas is awesome, but he can't do anything about the driving and the inconsistency of the income."
good,"You punch in on time then put on the Home Depot apron before you get on the sales floor. Answering customer questions based on the type of product they are seeking or know they want. Checking the smart phone for shelves that need restocking and inventory count when asked about the products availability. Clearing aisles of debris to ensure shopper safety. If I was working as a special order help desk associate a typical day starts with running reports for will call, pick up deliveries scheduled for the date in question, and follow up courtesy calls for delivery times and post delivery satisfaction. Checking customers out as a cashier as well as handling returns. Inspecting returns based on the company policy and supervisor protocol. Locating and retrieving merchandise for all in store special order pick ups from the shipping department. signing out clients who picked up orders before leaving the store for record purposes. handling phone calls regarding product inventory, store location, and redirecting them based on the department that can answer the question posed. Reorganizing the shelves based on the products being scattered. Cutting electrical wire by feet."
good,"clean,stock and customer service for the paint department. filled in for department supervisor for 6 mo. this job gave me many opportunities that i took to educate myself in many fields within the store. the training programs were educational and very informative. they also were very hands on in many of the training. I enjoyed all the thing i was able to learn about with them."
good,If you like to care about others who do not really care about you become one of the kind faces of this company.
good,"I really enjoy working at Home Depot. The managers are very nice, the coworkers are helpful, and the customers are nice as well."
good,"Customers treat cashier horrible!! Also we are suppose to get a 15 minute break but the break starts from the minute that we leave our station. So if we are a cashier in garden we have to run to the break room so we can actually have a break. If we walk then we get like a 5 minute break because home depot is a big store. the hardest part about this job is standing on concrete all day not really getting to move around much. Some days are really busy but when they are slow, they are really slow."
good,The Home Depot taught me a wealth of knowledge! I had a great time with my departments. I would always offer them incentive to exceed but that was not consistent throughout the company. Leadership changes and there were always job eliminations did not feel secure and I wasn't.
good,"Good job, working hand and hand with customers and employees. Mangers care enough to ask, and follow up on suggestions."
good,"Climbing ladders, heavy lifting, reading planning tool, M-F 6am-2:30pm"
good,"I enjoyed working at the home Depot. My co-workers were amazing to work with. Management depends on the individual and their management style, it could be hectic for the staff or some manages had a culture of good staff building and good moral techniques."
good,"I love working here, the pay is below average, but the people you work with are like family. management is 50/50 I love the work I do "
good,People are very warm and helpful management understand you in a better way give u an apporunity to grow in a company. And encourage you to work in other departments
good,My dad works there and when I was in high school he got me a job there. I got payed $11 dollars and hour and was a cashier. Loved my job. Wish I still worked there. I meet my husband there. I’ve heard a lot has changed though. But it’s a nice place. Just has some complications depending on the store
good,Management would be unfair at times. Some employees could get away with doing things that other employees couldn't. A typical day could be very fast paced. Keeping the customers happy and in out quickly was a main part of the day. The most enjoyable part of my job was the monthly kid workshop.
good,The home depot truly tries to care for there people. Employees have tons of benefits. As of most places people that should never have been hired let alone be promoted are.
good,I like the customers.  I was there because it was all I could find to feed my family and there was so much favoritism at the store I was at that they tired to tell me I was imaging things.  I knew I wasn't but we decided to change states so it was mute
good,"I worked in lot and during the summer it was hot during the winter it was cold, I worked hard doing a bit of everything even though I was in the lot would recommend"
good,le travail etait agréable maisle salaire etait trop bas
good,Home Depot overall is a great company to work for. A lot is changing within the company itself. I feel monetary policy needs to change immediately. Need better raises.
good,Good coworkers but bad managements the Home Depot 6501 location. Managers have favorites and it shows if you are not because you are treated like another person to pay instead of a coworker
good,I worked part time and enjoyed what I did.The pay was only minimum wage and should have been higher. Overall management was good and knowledgeable. Overall good.
good,"Too many hours for salaried Assistant managers"
good,Managers would constantly not agree on what they have you do so you end up doing a task and scolded multiple times due to the managers not being on the same page.
good,"Love working here, store manager is the worst part, we leave our managers not the job, lack of engagement from Manager, lack of personal accountability from store manager, lack of sympathy, lack of development"
good,"It is a very good place to work. You have the people to contend with. If you're looking for a first job or somewhere to ride out to the "
good,"you had to take courses on the computer of cashing and you had updates to refresh your mind on a regular bases. The work not hard some what fun took the job serious, but it was great time."
good,working as a roofer is hard when its really hot because the sweat gets all over your face and eyes. on a cold day it feels nice and it makes it easier to work outside
good,Don't really have much to say. The managers didn't care about the rules and it made the rest of us miserable. There was free coffee so i guess that's a plus.
good,Good place to work during the summer when I was in college. The pay was enough to cover some of my expenses. Difficult to live off of employment from HD alone.
good,"Needs better management, the home depot is always sade and excellent when fixing customers problems. The management will absolutely do nothing about problems unless you go over higher power."
good,"I absolutely loved working for Home Depot. Plenty of opportunities for advancement if you're willing to put in the work. One main down side is the schedules that are always all over the place, making it hard to balance work / life. The salary was ok for the position, and I've always had great managers."
good,"Great place to work if you are not a Manager. No consistency in Management, lots of favoritism. But great family atmosphere, associates are close.  You are promoted on who you know and promoting their agenda."
good,Everybody friendly very helpful with the customers you can find nice helpful workers that live to help the customers and make sure there happy with there purchases
good,it was very fast paced and they teach you as you go. not a lot of formal training but everyone is willing to give you any information they have learned.
good,"As a cashier you are the last person the customer sees before they leave. You take the persons items and scan them in a timely fashion."
good,This is a silence place to work specially for all people even went I was the only one who can be translated in Spanish at that time they don’t care about you or your family they just wanna make money
good,Management needs to be a little more professional when dealing with its workers. It's a company that values rewarding rear end kissing above hard work.
good,"I was hired as a temporary part time night stocker.  I was always on time and reliable, I never missed a day.  I tried to do my best was willing to stay late and be a team player  I found out last week my position was terminated as of July 6."
good,nice place to work but split shift .had to get quotas ever week was hard on some weeks do to slow customers. would get wrote up if you didnt get your quota and it reflected you review for you raise
good,"Nothing too special. It's a retail job, you clock in, work, and clock out. Same thing, day in and day out. It's not great, and not bad. Just exactly what you would think it would be."
good,"it was fairly easy but you had to get everything done in 4 hours. which was a close call mostly every night. was good management, not anymore. theres fork lifts"
good,"we worked hard, going the extra mile, to meet our customers needs and expectations, by creating a positive comfortable atmosphere, making sure when the customer leaves the store, they live with a good experience, and want to come back for more."
good,"I have worked for Home Depot for 15 years. Only in the last year have I felt let down by it's leadership. I have seen two manager go through my store and have not felt "" family atmosphere"" that I have come to love about home depot.There is a lack of true recognition for many of the hard workers and more politics than should be in this type of work. Also many non performer seem to drift through the day and keep their jobs while others have to pick up the slack. The schedules are not efficient or effective do to the fact that many the individuals skills and abilities are not taken into consideration."
good,all depend on where you work at. I started in garden then moved to freight and overnight stacking which was relaxed for the most part we got the store together before the store opened up.
good,Fun place to work.. although the management team is poor.. they say they are family oriented but they barely look out for their employees when in need..
good,"Night shift with a great crew. Really liked working here even though nights are the worst for your social life. Simple job, minimal pay. Possible health risk with pigeon droppings all over the place."
good,"Didn't pay mileage, traveling distance sometimes over 80 miles one-way"
good,Fun place to work! Nice management. Staff motivates you to always do better an look out for one another. They appreciate each worker an yes fun events to bring staff together.
good,"Its a great place to work and help people out however, the current management team is not so great. However, the actual job is really fun. I loved helping customers out trying to find the right equipment for their job. You learn a lot of new things by being there especially things on how to DIY projects in your own home."
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work. good benefits. great hours, The only downside i have had in the stores i have worked in is there is not very much room for advancement in the company."
good,The company is GREAT! Benefits and Paid time off. Only thing is Poor management and leadership! Pretty hard to get promoted. Schedule are set! Company is great for kids fresh out of High school
good,"Fast Paced, opportunity for growth . Hard work competitive pay, some managers are good some are not.  A little flexible with schedule. No tolerance for attendance tardiness."
good,"Cashiering was enjoyable but hours were different every week and made home life routine difficult."
good,"Typical day starts at 4 am. Price integrity and shelf organizing is 80% of the shift. The people are great to work with and my supervisor in particular is extremely supportive. There is some clash with store partnership but most issues can be solved with haste and productivity continues. Moving steel beams when adjusting planograms can be difficult and may need the assistance of seasoned veterans. The most enjoyable part of this job i must say is the set schedule of monday through friday, from 4 am to 12:30 pm."
good,Great employees whom are very helpful. They teach you a lot about home improvement. The workplace has a great atmosphere. Definitely recommended!!!!!!
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with but felt that I was not given the right or fair chances to advance my career. Others were able to easily further their career and opportunities were never available for myself and others that I worked with.
good,good place to work with really good benefits. the pay is not that good. the place gives a good chance to employees to progress and understand any personal problems.
good,"Most enjoyable environment to work in with a very friendly and ready to assist work team. Upper management always available, however my immediate supervision not which, at times, became a challenge."
good,I usually only worked 4 hours in the morning moving lumber and loading vehicles I learned how to be an effective forklift driver. Management liked to place blame on everyone else and hire department heads from out of the company. The culture was great. the hardest part of the job was my supervisors. we would stay until 1 AM and be expected to be back at 5 AM. I enjoyed driving the forklifts.
good,I loved the time that I spent at Home Depot. They truly know how to take care of their employees. Advancement opportunities are plentiful if you are driven to make them happen.
good,Mostly Friendly customers and coworkers. Very helpful. They consider in anything u suggest or recommend. Also if things are not so good they trythere haredest to help u through obstacles
good,People were always looking to pass the buck and never stood by their word.  Everyday was a new mess and no one ever wanted to just do their job.  I was happy to leave.
good,"Pay was horrible, but enjoyed working with great people. I enjoyed learning new things on the job, variety of things to do. the hours of the overnight shift was hard to get used to and didn't work very well with the family life."
good,"The Company as a whole was an excellent experience. I learned constantly and motivated my team to provide the best in Customer service. I was happy to develop and promote associates and create the leaders of tomorrow. I especially enjoyed the fast pace and pressure of competitive retail. My favourite aspect was working with People, both Customers and Staff."
good,"Cashier and Sale Associate in Paint Department"
good,My peers and customers were great. My peers were supportive and always willing to lend a helping hand. The customers became close and were patient.
good,"As a college student, it was important for me to find a place that would work with my class schedule. The manager approved any schedule change, and the hours are reasonable. Its not a job that will pay all your bills,, but it's good."
good,"Overall Home Depot is a fantastic company. "
good,"Its alright but I wouldnt recommend anyone work there. Good staff but management sucks very much. Learned alot."
good,"The people I worked with were always fun and friendly. If we were closing we would always help each other if another was with a customer. I loved when we had the kid workshops, it gave me the chance in interact with the little one and their parents."
good,nice place to work. Hours can be hard depending on your lifestyle. Most people are nice. Some are rude. Management needs improvement.
good,"This is a good part time job.  However hours are limited in the winter months  Coworker are excellent to work."
good,"Ive worked in many departments during my stay at home depot. Working in the front end you had to maintain great customer service and a very accurate and speedy check out. Working at the customer service area answering calls, helping customers process orders and pick up deliveries made my days go by faster than others. Working at the returns desk was one of my favorite job titles working at home depot. Management was very understanding and supportive."
good,"On my way to work I would set goals in my head for certain jobs. I would figure out where to place associates in order to make our goal. Sometimes throughout the day if our numbers were low I would have to rearrange the team. i learned that not everyone has good days, not even most of the time. So i would try to make the day better without too much attention focused on one individual. When our goals were met, i tried to push for more. I learned that not all are willing team members. Some associates were satisfied with what they had to meet. The management in the department i worked was very little. In the other departments they were nice and kind. My co workers were great and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was filling in as a supervisor. I was not ready for the mental challenge of that title. Such as having an open ear for  associates complaints about the job and complaining about the other associates. I feel like I was not the person to come to for these issues. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to do what i was set up for. I really liked my job and the duties that came with it."
good,"First of all, I have worked for THD for 3 years. I recently quit due to personal reasons. I love the company on a whole- but it's difficult to get a good management team. But I would absolutely recommend them as a company- I grew up in an apron and I wouldn't trade that for the world."
good,"A typical work day of order processing by pulling, labeling and shipping preparation for multiple products of a distribution warehouse."
good,"I enjoyed the fast pace of each day, the associates I worked with.  The customers made each day enjoyable and exciting with some new challenge on a daily basis."
good,"typical day at work was to walk in and know you werent getting off the phone until you had a break or it was time to go home, learned how to work at a steady pace, in a large call center enviroment, managment did not seem to interested if their was ever a problem. The hardest part of the job was that you could not take a bathroom break without your pay being affected. The most enjoyable part was the co workers."
good,"Great place to work for, all of the people you will work with are very kind and fun. Hardest part of this job is actually promoting to full time."
good,The Home Depot is a fair place to work. However as a part time or seasonal team member you are not considered for benefits.
good,Not a really bad place but not a place I would recommend if you feel destined not to move up or experience a different life style because they teach you to get ready for everyone to buy.
good,"learned new skills, spent a lot of my day interacting with customers.   gained valuable experience,  enjoyed working as  a team, learned how to be efficient and promote safe environment"
good,"Not much too say, come visit me at work you will understand.......Try one shift here you will pull out the remaining hairs you have left."
good,I worked for Home Depot for 11 years. At a corporate level they are wonderful the treat you as though you matter but down in the trenches. I learned how to keep my department profitable buy staying in stock giving great customer service  My co- workers are some of the finest people I know. The hardest part of the job was working under my last Store Manager he made the job unbearable and there was nowhere to go. no one could help me. I loved coming to work facing new customers as well as old friends and help solve all of their problems I will miss that and my orange family
good,The associates that I work with are like a family to me.  I have learned so much in my time there and feel I could tackle just about any job if given to me.  If I have a question I feel comfortable asking one of my associates for their expertise and opinions.
good,Working for the company was a great experience. Hours was great also my co-workers were awesome. I learned a lot at this company.
good,"I use to love this job until I was in  car accident now I am seeking work at home long term offers . I am very reliable and trustworthy, mother of 5 one with autism and need second income to meet living arrangements for my family."
good,"My typical day at work at the Home Depot was always fun, happy and enjoyable. I learned how to work under high pressure during the busy season. The management team at Home Depot was great, they were very kind and understanding to all their employees. My co-workers and I got along great, there was never a dull moment during a typical work day. We were always making new friends with employees every day. The hardest part of the job would have been that during my employment at Home Depot, I was due to have a baby and during my pregnancy it was difficult for me to stand up for long periods due to my swelling and high blood pressure. The most enjoyable part of the job was that everyone always got along with each other, and that the customers were always so kind to each and every associate, for the most part."
good,"enjoyed working with customers and co workers, worked as a team member."
good,I've learned a lot of things working for The Home Depot. I was able to perform challenging duties which I enjoyed doing.
good,A typical day at work would be me signing in to a cash register and then putting a smile on my face and greeting and assisting customers with finding and choosing purchases then ringing up sales as customers were ready to check out. I had a friendly management team and great coworkers who enjoyed keeping things light and fun.
good,"The hours wasn't family orientated , benefits were great, a lot of peaks, bonus 2  per year.  big holidays and weekends were the busiest time have to be on the run making sure coverage to take care of customer needs in a timely manner."
good,"I spent most of the day working to prepare orders for contractors to pick up. This enabled me to demonstrate a good work ethic, motivation, and discipline."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company, the only set back was upper management and the lack of training for new management."
good,"I enjoyed going to work, learned something new everyday, best part of the day was helping people."
good,Ok most of the time what I learned about mangement they donot care about the workers.Co workers were great. Dealing with mangement that nothing about what needed to be done or cared but they whould allways a question. Training new people was the most enjoyable.
good,"There are so many different things and areas you can learn here. There's paid training, and workshops."
good,Great working with public loved the people I supervised this job had a lot of responsibility's but I loved the challenge and the fast pace that I worked at. this job taught me a lot about management positions that I have been able to incorporate in every job I go to. great place to work.
good,My Review Is That The Management Don't Worry About The Employees As Much As They Worry About Customers. They Forget That Having Happy Employees You'll Have Happy Customers Automatic.
good,"I learned a lot every day I was a cashier I enjoyed the job until the head cashier had a problem with me.     in front of customers she yelled at me for rolling my eyes I didn't even know i was doing it.  Later on I was trying to help out & the workers seemed to be getting upset every time I tried to lend a hand. one even said i was disrespecting the head cashier that i was trying to help."
good,I really loved this job; though my co workers had no respect for themselves our management  or anyone else.   The work was very demanding and fast paced and I loved every min of it.
good,During the year that I worked at Home Depot was great. I would Love to be able to work for their company again. I learned so many valuable skills that I was able to take with me to new jobs that I have obtained. The only down side was the Management. I had the privilege of working with the management of other locations near me and they were a pleasure to work with but my store in particular had some of the works managers that I have ever encountered. Of course this was over a year ago and there could very well be new management there so don't let my review scare you away from working there because it was one of the best jobs I have ever had. Working there was both fun and challenging and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for work.
good,"Great place to work, wonderful co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting and working with the customers."
good,"Fast paced and high energy job, worked with multiple computer systems. It was exciting to see new products daily and sales. They were always willing to cross train with other departments"
good,self starter  computers  putting together  transfers to other stores as well
good,"I am a head cashier, which means I do the schedules for the day on who get's breaks at what times. I also at times fill in at the Special Service desk helping with special orders and returns. I have learned that you need to be a little strong headed. You can get angry customers or you can get the understanding customers. You don't know what your day will be like until you get to work and your working for 5 minutes then you know if your crazy busy or calmly busy. Management, well that is an issue. Store manager, you won't see him on the floor unless his boss comes to the store. The other managers are great on helping when needed. Co workers are GREAT to work with, they help when needed no matter where they are at in the store. Hardest part of my job is when you deal with the customer and your with them forever it seems and you still can't help them. You tried everything possible and you still can't get the product. Enjoyable time is when your helping with a big project and at the end when everything is said and done and the customer is happy with the results when finished job is done.  I do really enjoy my job, but I have been turned down so many times in moving up from my position as a head cashier. I would like to either be on the floor more or a Department Supervisor and it seems every time I interview the manager gives me a turn around. I and other coworkers feel that I would do great as a DS."
good,"a typical day at work  At the Home Depot, they do most of their stocking, or “packdown” as it is referred to in the company, at night while the store is closed. It allows you to get more accomplished without having to work around customers and associates. Being lift equipment certified before you start at Home Depot is not mandatory. Each store has one or more trainer on staff that will teach you what you need to know about using lift equipment. In fact, everybody that uses lift equipment has to go through the same certification process. It sounds bad, but it really isn’t. The training consists of an online video and on-the-job training."
good,"My typical work day consists of assisting customers with purchases and inquires, replenisment of inventory, organizing my work area and maintaining professionalism at all times."
good,"part time hours can be few"
good,"A typical work day consists of me changing to any department needing assistance. I am very well rounded in the work place and am knowledgable of most departments, although this is helpful, it is the most difficult part of the job as well. I have had managers request for me to be in multiple departs at once, which can get somewhat stressful. This has taught me much about multi-tasking, and time management. My favorite part of my job is being able to assist customers and find a solution to their needs. The majority of my co-workers make the envioronment very enjoyable, but some make my job difficult when they won't put effort into their job."
good,"I help customers, I learn something new everyday, i like my co workers, management its not top off the line, Home Depot has fired and changed a lot of management, in my time I have been there, we have had now three new Store Managers.

I came to work everyday. Never missed a day.
good,As a cashier I was able to interact with customers with a smile and able to open new accounts for credit cards. I learned to communicate with the public on a more friendly and professional level. With a great management team and co workers it made our store happier.

good,"Hard warking fast past environment"
good,"A typical day at the home depot always starts off by reviewing the safety precautions of the store. Then we would do a quick stretching exercise to limper up before any heavy lifting. After we go to our assigned departments and start the day. As the day continues we keep in mind everything we have learned about safety and apply it throughout the work day. I just believe one of the hardest parts about the job, is when we see children playing and running around the store. We try to tell the parent/s what are with them to make sure they keep close to them and make sure they do not run or play too much in the store since we have very dangerous equipment. Some parents get angry when we let them know this and sometimes it leads to them getting angry but we just let them know its just a safety thing so they come in and out okay."
good,"-Mix paint for customers"
good,its a very fast pace and costumer focus job making sure items are priced correctly and charge as mandated in register . friendly staff and many departments to learn from

good,I loved working for home depot but everyone doesn't seem like they are on the same page. You have alot of employees that just show up to get a pay check and very few that actually take pride in what they are doing. On top of that managers would give us an absurd amount of work to do then complain that our daily work wasn't getting finished.
good,Great place to work with great management and great team members - tough sales environment with lots of competition but compensation can be matched accordingly for work ethic
good,Great place to work. Great benefits and flexible work schedule. There is opportunity to grow in your career. It’s an environment that you can learn different concepts of hardware and be creative.

good,I enjoyed entertaining customers but not everyday you get happy faces especially when you work at returns. There are customers who really try to test your patience but we are always protected at work with some malicious or violent customers.
good,The store has a high turn over rate due to the stresses of retail. Overall a good company to work for. Days off vary and they don't allow holidays off because it is retail

good,I could not say enough positive things about THD. There are so many bright and driven individuals here that all have a common goal in mind. There is little supervision which allows room for new ideas to emerge and take root. Management is always willing to listen to new ideas and improvements to processes already in place. Great culture and wonderful leadership/ management.

I worked in the Electrical department and for AHS to help create appointments for window, roofing and vinyl siding installations in the South Shore area and other parts of the geographic area. It helped me pay off my car note, my school loans, all of my credit cards, and save $15,000 in my bank account at Rockland Federal Credit Union to make me comfortably set up and ready to move out into an apartment living on my own. During 2003-2008 the housing market was doing well, so business was doing well at this point in time with the company."
good,"That's nothing negative I can say about this company, they treat their associates like they would treat their customers,  empowering them to make choices to empower the business."
good,Home Depot was one of my first jobs coming out of high school and I can say it’s hot me a good bit about the work world that I was about to enter and it taught me how to manage mean it taught me customer service it taught me a great deal of things that I carry on with me and all of my new jobs Home Depot was only a seasonal job so I wasn’t there long before the summer but I would go back

good,I like work for home depot because they have a good benefits and they pay good . Also it is a big company when they have alot of opportunity and i can grow professionally .
good,"Working there has taught me so much such as dealing with irate customers and being able to multi-task. Management was stern and tough, but very fair. They would ask you to do a lot, but they really appreciated your hard work and they would let you know. The most enjoyable part about working there were my co-workers. We were like one big family."
good,"The management team strives to ensure that all employees are happy and taken care of. Customer service is the number one priority, making it a place that you can say you’re proud to be a part of"
good,"The people there were fun and exciting to work with, Little drama but what job doesn't have that. The customers can either make your job enjoyable or less than pleasant, But as long as you do your job you wont have any problems and you will be in and out of there like any other day."
good,"Maintain financial or account records."
good,I enjoy working to satisfy customers .  I go above and beyond    There are alot of poor work ethics among the crew. Alot of the associates are not held accountable for their actions. Miserable coworkers. Not on board team players makes difficulty to help meet needs of customers.    I need a happy positive work place.
good,It's a great company to work for. My favorite part of the day is helping customers find there needs for their D.Y.I. projects or their everyday repairs.
good,"I enjoyed my short 6 months of employment there,but the short hours didnt make up for my commute.But all the other employees were very helpful friendly,and knowledgeable during my training."
good,I worked here for 5 years and I  miss it now. I miss the people who became family. I would usually clock in go to my schedule find my location for the day and next thing I know it was time to go home. The days are so fast pace that you almost feel like you were just there for an hour. All management was amazing. (Except for one who has moved to another store) they cracked jokes and really cared about you not just as an employee but as a person. I had a panic attack from school related stress and I was given time to sit in the office and unwind with a fan and a glass of ice water and my manager cracked jokes to make me laugh and not think about outside factors. This place was my home for 5 years and if I didn't get a BS in biology I would have stayed there and moved up slowly.
good,I work overnights unloading the truck and packing out the freight. I have aquired a lift truck license at The Home Depot. Fast paced environment some of the freight is heavy. Management is nice.

good,"In my eight years as a sales associate with The Home Depot, I have been increasingly impressed with this company, the efficiency with which it's run and it's admirable business philosophy. They are always hiring, even if you don't necessarily have a background in Home Improvement. If you're willing to work hard, you're hired. It's business philosophy is the Upside Down Pyramid, meaning: Customers are on top or the first concern and followed by them in successive importance or increasing level of responsibility to insure world class customer service are sales associates, assistant and store managers and at the very bottom is the company's CEO. This is unprecedented to me and I have always been proud to work with such a company whose goal is the best customer service in the business."
good,"The TEAM atmosphere is great! It feels rewarding when you are there to help a customer with a project and it all comes together. From the smallest home need to the largest. Whether there are bumps in the road, or if its a smooth ride. The end result is what we are there for."

good,"For the most part, working customer service/returns desk is quite enjoyable. I get to work with some great people and everyone is there to help with any questions I might have pertaining to a sale, return or customer question that I can't answer. The desk is fast paced so that each customer has a minimal wait time to be assisted. My most enjoyable times is when I have other coworkers assisting at the desk during rush times of the day. Working at the desk by myself can be both stressful and unpleasant."
good,"Wonderful coworkers, sufficient training, has mix of fast-paced busy hours, and lulls.  My favorite part is learning from the customers.  The hardest part is attempting to work with an upset customer."

good,I enjoyed alot the chances i had to be helpful and to be able to solve alot of the customers problem with my experience and knowledge of the trade and to be the go to person when someone did not know how to help the customer. I was offered supervisor position but i had a full time job that paid me more than the supervisor full time position would have.
good,A great company that makes its employees feel like they are family and have a chance to move up in the business based off handwork and consistency. I would refer anyone to this company.

good,"During my time of employment with Home Depot and there Core Values for us to follow made me an even more exceptional employee. I learned several different departments through out the store. One main thing that improved the most on was knowledge of products. In doing so i was not only able to greet the customer, but i found it best to be able to find out the DIY project the customer was working on in able to serve them better. Typical day for me was scheduled 10 hour shifts walking at least 2 to 5 miles a day on concrete. My location and Home Depot was a diversity of individuals. Hardest part of my position was resetting aisles of product. part of that included the safety process of moving shelf beams. my enjoyable part of my job and locations i worked at was that there was times we were able to joke and laugh that helped build better team work and the working friendships that went beyond our employment. during my work reviews i allows scored above average. Supervisors would always tell me that they would love to rank me as an exceptional employee, being highest level. But, there is always things that we could gain knowledge in. within those statements it was always known that there was hardly if any highest level evaluation."
good,"At Home Depot it was a pretty fun/caring environment. Home Depot always wanted to make sure to provide the best service no matter what. If a sales associate didn’t have an answer get anyone else to help them out, but never say that we don’t know or didn’t have an answer"

good,"A typical day for me is making sure my cashiers get what they need in timely manner, it goes from getting change, to a pinpad won't work, or the computer froze, or something doesn't have a tag on it, etc. I learned to work smarter not harder in this particular job because if I worked harder and made things more complex then I wouldn't get everything I need done. The most enjoyable thing about this job is the people I work with, they're all so nice and enthusiastic, but the worst part about it is when someone you get to know so well ends up leaving the company."

good,"I love the company, but had issues with assistant mangers in the particular store I worked at constantly contradicting each other and even sometimes themselves. At a certain point it also felt that some employees (including leadership) intentionally did things to make the new store manager look bad."
good,It isn’t fun and they do promise advancement but I never saw the inside of the store. The job provided little compensation. The manager was a real stand up guy and the assistant managers were fair. I didn’t like my supervisors. Both of them being female really gave them reason to be harsh on me.
good,"Customer service, teamwork, stocking, loading, and forklift driver.  "
good,"I'm a hardworking person and the workload is a lot. It's not that easy if you're lazy since every objective is based on a weeky basis meaning that some requirements have to be met by the end of the week, and my team is always working together to make the store better"

good,Fast pace and logic required to do the job but you get it after awhile and it's a breeze. Wish the pay was more for the amount of work they have you do but hey don't we all.

Management while I was working at this particular store, was not great. I was made garden associate, but manager decided to schedule me more cashier hours and take me off garden associate without informing me. I was approved a few days vacation, then told if I did not attend the store meeting during my vacation days, I would be fired."

Customers can receive customer service from employees in which ever department  they need help in. On a normal day at Home Depot it is very busy. We have customers that come in and know what they want and then we have those customers that come in and don't know what they want. at the end of the day my duty is to check them out and make sure they leave the store happy.
good,obviously a good job for anyone considering electrician/plumbing/construction but even if you're not it's still a good job to learn some general skills

good,"I loved working here in the beginning. in my 2nd year of being here, they started firing the old people and hiring in new ones that were there for a check but not to do work. getting help to assist customer was draining. They would always pretend they were too busy to help when all they were doing is watching movies on their phones and doing social media. I liked working with the customers overall, but like any other work place, your work ethics mean nothing , you have to kiss a lot of behind if you want to go far here."

good,"Even as a normal departmental associate, there is always something to be doing. Maintaining stock and pursuing answers for customers are most of the day but there are also many smaller tasks plainly laid out each morning. Within a year, I had moved up to being a full-time associate and soon after to being a specialist, all by merely doing my best every day (and making sure management knew it). The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest."

Then able to organize small to large spaces then often home repairs of the right kind. Each jon had its own unique life guide like most job, but when it is time to open your wings and fly you take a deep breath and let the wind take you to your next adventure."

good,"Home Depot is  a great company unfortunately I am in no way being compensate for my years of experience, In their defense they are in discussion to make some changes but I give 150% daily and came with a great work history I started from rock bottom and have not moved.

good,"Fun workplace that focuses on customer service, and making the work environment inviting and enjoyable for everyone."
good,Typical day at work was handling multiple customer issues at a time. Multitasking both running the store and helping out in departments that are busy or under staffed. Hardest part of the job was hearing customer's upset and yelling at you over something that was not your fault and remaining calm. The most enjoyable is teaching and training my associates and watching them grow with the company.

They were angry at me when I left because they were finally going to offer me the position i found out, but i had already accepted a Managers position for another company. Management ignored me for the last month that i worked there. I was very upset when I left, because before all this i had always been on a good basis with management. I worked 3 years in a specialty department on cashier pay because by the time they moved me into the department i had been working for 3 months they told me they were no more step increases. There is no moving up(at least in my local HD) unless your a middle age man or you have been there since the store opened."

good,At the beginning of my shift I would check the board for any updates on sales and future events. I would then make my way to my department and take inventory. During specific set hours I would find and offer customers any assistance they may need. Whether it is finding a product or explaining the product in some degree.

If you desire a steady job for long periods of time i wouldn't recommend this place. Every week is newer greater challenge. Very energetic work area once you get in your groove.

Even management made the days fun while providing excellent service when needed. Home Depot makes everyone feel like family, so this is a job that will always be enjoyable."
good,"Home Depot is a good corporation to work for, however the fact that they don't really look to the skills that some individuals have makes them lack in the possibility of leadership. Some individuals rise through the ranks despite this, but a lot of the culture is not geared toward success, but toward profit alone."

good,"It was a fine company to work for.   I began working at home depot in 2005 and attended all training classes (plumbing, electrical and sales) at Mare Island, CA prior to starting work at the Windsor store.  The training, I believe, was invaluable to the associates at Home Depot.  I was then placed in the appliance sales department and was one of the top produces.

I was given the tasks of making orders, giving customer service, organizing and maintaining the area by having it clean, neat and in order.

good,"Assisted store manager to enhance specialty   sales processes with a particular focus on kitchens and flooring."
good,"A typical day at work is coming onto work to work backroom. Even though you know what to do on your job task for the day you will have 4 different team leads or managers come to you giving you different assignments regardless  of what the last manager told you to do. They either tell you what you already know what to do for the day or give you a completely different task and its up to you as a team member to get everything if not most of it done during your shift. Most of the time its hard because your running around sweating and moving fast and sometimes its okay. The hardest part is getting all of it done before your shift is over but I learned that no matter how many task you have for the day, pasting yourself makes everything easy because when you don;t rush is when you finish everything on time. I have no idea why when you move fast it seems slow and when you move steady it gets the job/s done."
good,I really loved working at Home Depot. Taught me so much in home improvement that I would of never learned anywhere else. I really love my co workers we still keep in contact to this very day.

The people, store associates too, were all very pleasant to be around.  I would love to stay but the pay rate is just too low for a company that profits billions a year and has most associates being paid under poverty level income.  They keep saying there is a career path but after years of hard work and applying for multiple positions I never received an interview for a promotion - they kept hiring outside people."

good,"working at the home depot was a rewarding job. I was excited to see what was in stored for me everyday, of course like every job it had it's ups and downs, but overall the company itself was amazing. I've made life long friends with some of my co-workers and the management team kind of lacked in communication but they were always available whenever they were needed. I can't really say that there was a hard part of the job, but  when working in retail you really never know what your day is going to look like, so it definitely took some patience and professionalism. the most enjoyable day of the job is knowing that the customer who desperately needed your help is left satisfied and happy. Helping someone whether it's at a store or on the streets always makes me feel elated."

good,"A typical work day at Home Depot is busy as soon as you clock in. At the Service Desk, customers are already waiting to return defected product, or check out.

good,"Home Depot as a whole is an amazing company who deeply cares about their workers. I had the unfortunate event of everyone in my management being fired and new management taking over. The first year working there was an amazing experience and they took good care of me. After the new management, over 30 people were fired including close friends who had worked the store for 16+ years. The rate of pay is very promising, supervisors in majority are a bit power hungry, but with the stress they have it is to be expected. I would rate management for Home Depot in majority 5 stars but at my store my new management was very poor and unfair to its employees. My favorite part of the job was the learning, due to so many people being fired I had the chance to learn every department in the store, including supervisor and management skills. Until people started getting fired left and right from lift equipment (strict safety protocols), that was probably my favorite thing to do, use the forklifts and reach lifts to transport items. The hardest part of the job is the stress level and constantly having to work more than one department at a time while getting yelled at that your not doing your job properly or fast enough. (If I could do it all over again, I wish I had gone to a different store, other stores management and stress level is so much better). I would still be working there today if they had the original management. (Ended in me giving in my resignation, the job deteriorated my health and I felt my co-workers had been treated unfairly)."

good,It was an awesome place to work at my only issue is there is very strict on giving out full-time positions which I needed at the time because I just had went through a divorce and I can live off for an $12 a  hour plus part time...So that way maybe look for employment elsewhere other than that it’s awesome place if they can fix those areas
good,Retail never pays well but I exactly liked working here something was always different everyday and also learnings the products they sold helps you out on how to use tools
good,"Home Depot cares a lot about their employees. Has. Nice work environment, could have more training in different areas. The Home Depot has great opportunities for hard workers."
good,I would start by getting all of the returns and bring them back to my department and put them away. After that was done I would roam the aisles looking for customers so that I could help them with whatever project they were working on. Occasionally I would be called to come to the front and make copies of keys which was also apart of my job in the hardware department.
good,Fast paced answering phones assisting customers and contractors. Also working with in store order pick ups and you work with great people. The hardest part for me was that there was no way to a full time position.
good,My hours got cut. I love working there but I need a job that can offer me more hours. I drove hilow and lift truck to bring pallets up and down in racking. Also help customers to the best of my ability
good,Great family like working environment. If you are a people person this is the place to be. Always meeting new people and helping solve problems and create solutions.
good,Typical day at work was normal unloading freight and then put away in departments for the hours I work from 9pm to 1am in the morning five days a week. What I learn there about the job was that do your work and the rest will follow. The management of my boss is a laid back person as long as you are working and doing what need to be done. The hardest part about the job was when people are not schedule and the other ones call inn makes the job more complicated to do. The most enjoyable part about the job will be finishing at the end of the shift on a good note of putting freight out.
good,My time was good but people are people i think the managers should be put under supervision cause they who make home depot harder to work for but everything else about Homedepot was good.
good,"It's a good starting job to be at. Management and co workers are really nice and caring. The customers are the joy of our days, even the ones that are having bad days because we make their day better"
good,"I enjoyed my early days there, but had some issues with management. I believe they are understaffed and don't know how to handle it. I left on decent terms. I think they're a great company, just not for me."
good,management is ridiculous and very judgmental. its like high school but a little worse. very discriminating!! lots of favoritism and gossiping from assistant managers. i do not recommend.
good,"It was fun the people were great, however the hours were long and there was much place for growth. Good for a part time job and for students. You can learn basic home improvement skills."
good,Pésima relación de gerencia de recursos humanos con los empleados.
good,"An alright place to work except you have the big corporation feel and guidelines that you must follow. Benefits sucked and scheduling was very rando, and absurd"
good,I have learned more about customer service. The management team is on top of everything and will go out of there way to help with any situation. Hardest part of the job is being sure associates and customers are following all safety procedures And the most enjoyable part of the job for me are the people I work with every day.
good,It was alot of fun to work there not everyday but most days. I enjoyed the ppl i worked with. I learned alot of home improvemnt soloutions. Correy friendly. Non judgemental. Overall a great place to work.
good,Home Depot as great benefit packages even success sharing when the store reach and super exceeds there overall annual projections. Like all major competitors in the market place Home Depot is yet to have a real competitor on the International fore front as a Hardware supple wear-house.
good,I am in charge of putting freight away in Hardware one of the busiest departments. So much physical work for just two people to tackle on. Feels like we have to run the whole 8 hour shift. Just would appreciate to be paid for the amount of physical labor we are doing.
good,my day consisted of cleaning and loading up customers. i learned how to help customers. management was very helpful and respectful. the hardest part of the job was loading customers by myself if they bought a large amount of concrete or tiles. the most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers and managers.
good,"The work environment is very productive, cooperative, and fun to work It. The co-workers are very helpful, out-Going and friendly. There’s always something to do at Home Depot and they acknowledge their hard working employees."
good,"I enjoy my job and the environment. Day by day I regularly interact with customers, vendors, and associates. I assist anyone in need of help, and I cannot help I refer them to someone who can."
good,"Loading and unloading wood of trucks, order selector( pulling wood orders and putting them together. Shelving and restocking lumber aisle. Maintaining the overall cleanliness of the lumber section."
good,Knowledgeable associates excellent training and continued advancement opertunities for knowledge and hands on skills. Amazing place to work. Only thing to watch out for are the occasional bad egg employees.
good,"I enjoyed working at the home depot more than Ive ever enjoyed working at any other place!  I loved the culture, the diversity, I learned so much working there."
good,"management was fair for the most part, co workers were awesome they said their hours were flexible but they really aren't. the job was easy, and for the most part fun. it could be stressful at times but for the most part it wasn't"
good,"I highly recommend working here for folks in need of a layover. Decent pay and job requirements, I would work there again if I could. Very pleasant customer relations experience."
good,"I loved working at Home Depot, pay is just too low to survive. The customers are fun, at least at the pro desk, get to meet the same people everyday, best part of the job."
good,learned how to use a reach truck and forklift learned alot while i was emploiyed there meet alot of people was able to increase my customer service skills
good,Usually fast paced. You learn a lot about all the different products they sell. Very easy to go up in job title. You get a yearly raise and quarterly bonus check.
good,As an entry level employee it is more than likely you will fall into a poverty level of income.   Favoritism seems to be the key to advancement.  Merchandising Dept is run by an inexperienced militant sexist man.
good,They had me working  long shifts without a break. People would ask to go on break and I would get pushed back to later in the day. No set time for breaks. They were unorganized with that. Other then that we had parties for good reason.
good,"This job required learning about hundreds of products and using this knowledge to assist customers to solve problems that they are encountering. "
good,"A typical dat at work is packing out pallets, shelf maintenance, and listening to the day objective. This job only perk is the weekly pay and flexible schedule. No room for promotion unless you like to kiss-butt."
good,"I enjoyed my experience with the Home Depot.  Great people, great leaders.  I learned a lot about the way they think about doing logistics operations."
good,I really enjoyed working for Home Depot. They are very consiterate of your needs and schedual availability. I would go back and work for them again in a heart beat.
good,"Started with the company when the building opened. Went through"
good,This company is a overall great company however they have a very high turnover rate. The management could be better trained and more organized to fit their role.
good,If you're a person who enjoys helping customers and solving problems Home Depot would be a good job.you get to perform your duties minimal supervision and if you need help my supervisors were there to help. I enjoyed my time with the company.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Home Depot."
good,"Overall okay"
good,What I learned from Home Depot Pearl City is that there will be long days that you will not be able to complete your assignments.  Also to many cliques
good,"A typical day at work is sitting checking people out and being nice to people even if they aren't nice to you. "
good,"A Typical Day day would  for ne to clock i\ to clock i n & get On a Register but while I am waiting dor customers to ring up I would Put away Soda drinks in the machines & Put Register tape in all the registers and fill In The Bags"
good,"Great place to work! Not enough hours given but wonderful place and Managers. I would recommend Home Depot to anyone as a great place to work! They give every employee fair hours, a chance to work full time or part time and give vacation hours! I enjoyed working there, and would work there again!"
good,My time with the company was great until I was forced into a new store where the SM was not accepting of my transfer into that store.  Was a challenge until my departure from the company.
good,"My typical work day at Home Depot would begin with me going in and starting to water the plants. I would also help any customers who needed help finding an item they needed, or answering any of their questions. They have a great management. Everyone is really nice their and everyone gets along well."
good,"I started of as a cashier at the Home Depot from there I learned how to do several other things throughout the store in different department s. I was trained in paint, plumbing windows and doors and hardware."
good,There is room for advancement at the Home Depot. Just have to work there for a while to get to open positions when available.  I left my position for a full-time and higher pay position doing the same type of work.
good,"My job has a wide variety of ""things to do"" from loading customers vehicles with a fork lift to unloading multiple semi-trailers a day. Caring about the quality of customer service in helping them find the right supplies for their DIY self projects, to cutting their lumber to their strictest requirements. Packing out the concrete and lumber and supplies that come off the trucks. There is so much to do that I never got bored with my job. I would not consider leaving except that it is ""retail"" and unless you are in management, it does not pay well enough to live on.It's time to claim the experience as positive , give them a two week notice and move on."
good,"I worked there it was fun but very messy,they wasn't that mature but is was very fun. Part time cashiers start you at 10 dollars an hour. It was actually my first job."
good,"The culture of the store completely depends on the management team, which is ever changing. Some stores are enjoyable to work at and others are just a paycheck"
good,My typical day at work with home depot was interesting I loved working n the garden department I had to learn something every day and love dealing with the customers the hardest part of my job was learning the different technique for gardening and most enjoyable was learning and when Christmas came around I use to like cutting the Christmas tree
good,Se trabaja con personal poco capacitado para el puesto
good,The Home Depot is a good company to work for except for some management issues that can be worked on.  The phone system is really bad and we loose many customers due to lack of response.  Management cannot get a handle on increasing the motivation of its sales staff to respond to incoming calls.  The heart of the business is the Freight team because the receiving and packing out of the items is so crucial for the store to effectively make available sales.  The sales staff cannot sell items in their department if the freight is not there.  Yet the freight team is looked upon as the lowest members of the store when they should be praised because of all the very hard work involved in getting the store ready for business.
good,"My most favourite workplace. Easy-going colleagues, simple job requirements, physical activity. I learned how to rebuild interpersonal relationships with clients on a face-to-face basis. I had lost this while working on the phones and it was refreshing to see people actually smile at me or make eye contact while speaking to them."
good,I loved my job at the honey depot. From forklift work to the costumers to the staff. Home depot is where it's at. Lots of quality experience and friendly personal.
good,"Home Depot was a friendly place, not only to their customers but their employees as well. I loved floating around to different departments and learning about each and the products there."
good,"Great place to earn experience and understanding in Retail, Sales and Operations. Once you become a department manager, which is a great opportunity and experience, but once you're there you'll be there for a long time. You kind of hit a ceiling and if you're like I was you'll want to go higher."
good,"Come to shift, prep, stock, prepare sandwiches."
good,"Home Depot is a flexible, fun and growing workplace. They give you good hours and awesome training. Minimum experience required just need a positive attitude."
good,Helping costumers with choosing plants and landscape options. The management was ok for the most part. The hours were a little stressful for someone going to school and raising kids.
good,"In my store schedule was weird, it was done 3 weeks in advanced but everyone was supposed to stay working the entire night even if you were only scheduled until 3am. On top of that you were responsible for keeping track of your own hours. if you went over 28hrs it was your fault."
good,"The HR manager refuse to allow me to work part time. This is all I have to say. Appliance department was a great department to work in, but they would not allow me to work parttime."
good,Great place for benefits but the pay and how hard they want you to work does not match but at the same time you know what you signed up for when in the interview
good,"I love working at Home Depot I just feel that iam interest in working with kids more.when I started at Home Depot 6 years ago we where getting about 150 to 200 kids every month at the workshops,ever sense I took over and became the captain we get over 600 kids now."
good,Lo mismo del trabajo diario ademas q no hay promocion de acuerdo alos conocimientos de lo que uno sabe ademas del salario para los que somos asociados montacarguistas por eso es mi busqueda hacia otro empleo
good,"Home depot was one of those jobs that was extremely good when it was good, but horrible when it turned sour. Managers would frequently sacrifice associates to save themselves."
good,Flexible schedule in which you are able to work and attend school. Management is nice and respectful. The company will provide you the guide and tools to succeed
good,Although a great company great family environment and fast pace the company can do more to cater to the workers need such as sick time and compensation
good,"The atmosphere of this job is pretty great. Once you get the hang of things and are accustomed to the environment, everything is a breeze. Overall, laid back."
good,"Okay place to work,no advancement or opportunity to be promoted to a higher position inside the store or other stores,small circle only gets promoted."
good,I was a Merchandising execution associate. I mostly dealt with seasonal resets. cross merchandising with all our store brands and sponsers and inventory. Overall its the position i kept the longest in my work history.
good,Home Depot is place you can learn and has lots of potential for growth if you apply yourself.  Home Depot is very competitive and also very cut throat.  Home Depot environment is made up of two sides and as an employee you have too decide which side are you going to be on.
good,I like Home Depot. The environment was fun and relaxed. Everyone got their work done and work was much relaxed. Everyone has their own department which made it easy
good,"For the most part every one got along, worked together and truly cared for one another."
good,The associate is not as important as it once was. Its all about money and numbers and that falls apart when you don't take care of the associate anymore. As a member of management there is no worklife balance and upper management does not rotate staff as it should in order to better the qaulity of life and to renew the challenges you see every day.
good,Many long hours and not enough resources to accomplish required goals. Company crushes sales goals but fails to deliver results as promised to the consumer.
good,Great company to work for but think that can use some approvment in areas of the bussiness. Also the other associates are very nice and fun to work for and the like that they have success sharing for the employees which we get a extra check.
good,"Great place to work.  Very accomodating to individual needs.  Train their people well.  Safety is their first priority.   Respectful employer,  do not discriminate."
good,Management really took care of their employees.  They not only educated us but they made us feel part of a team.  I learned so much about home repair...skills that will continue to be useful no matter where I am in life.  I really loved helping the customers that came in.  There were no stupid questions only opportunities to get creative solving a customers problem.
good,"Long long work hours unless you are a cashier. Not all females do work,some sexism here because I was told that females were alloed to lift but they don't and some managers don't care about bout there are some good co workers"
good,"From stocking shelves, and discussing flooring. Cutting custom length wood blinds, and setting installs for customers. Open to work in other departments, from pain, to lawn and garden!"
good,There were many people who were employed there and almost all of them were a tightly knit family of workers willing to help each other. The people who work there were always willing to give a helping hand and greet new employees with helpful insight to the job they've been tasked with.
good,"Everyone at the store is great to work with.  Customers are friendly.  I have learned more about building materials, tools, and gardening since starting to work.  I do enjoy the flexibility of changing areas of working.  Some day you may work as a cashier inside or outside in garden, others you may work at the self check out area assuring customers are checking out correctly without any issues."
good,"A typical day at work is fast-paced, fun, and sometimes a challenge, in which I enjoy. I've learned the true value of teamwork as working in a collective unit has taught me the ebb and flow of getting tings done. The culture is wonderful. Open-door policies, employee funds, and other incentives are really thoughtful of the company. I enjoy everyone I interact with."
good,This is a great work place to be it is something new everyday with some what of a routine that you can get behind. Management is great they are more than willing to work with you and help you advance.
good,Helped customers answer phones. Help customers get damaged items fixed. Found items for customers. Worked with stores helping customers. Sold products to customers.
good,"Sadly, I was only picked up once. I tried many mornings to work Day labor, but it was only a simple gig similar to a gig I had at a restaurant in Lake Charles Louisiana. In Lake Charles I made 40 dollars in 3 and half hours but in Washington DC when I was picked up for day labor at Home Depot I made 20 dollars in just one hour!"
good,"The Merchandising department is very team oriented and I found it easy to work with my coworkers. The job itself was not difficult, but very tedious, and repetitive."
good,I loved working at Home Depot even throughout some sour customers. Though your attendance is rock solid from start to finish... no matter weather conditions or uncontrollable traffic.
good,Great company for students and entry level positions. Tuition assistance and great benefits package. Must be willing to open scheduling between 6am and 2am.
good,"A typical work day at Home Depot was a normal day, weekdays were kind of slow and weekends were very busy. I learned hard work and dedication, there was always something new and different to do everyday. Everybody at Home Depot learned something new from one another. Management was great, they stopped what they were doing to work with us even on the busiest days.Home Depot workplace culture was amazing. We all had goals, we all wanted to bet he best, number one hardware store in the region. We were like a team but more like family. There was really nothing hard about the job to me because I loved my job and the tasks given to me. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co workers and getting to know the customers also making the customers day by making them know they can count on me to help and get the job done."
good,"Great work environment and atmosphere, decent pay for a retail job."
good,"I enjoyed the job that I had, and working with the other employees, however the place is more corporate then what I would prefer and there are times when I felt more like a number then a person."
good,"Majority of the time this company will return what you put into it, only issue is with so much competition for advancement it is easy to become overlooked, a lot of potential talent gets overlooked for various lengths of time, which is to be expected in a company this large."
good,"Home depot is a great place to work for, but unfortunately there isn't a lot of room to grow.  The day goes by very fast due to foot traffic.  There is always something to do."
good,"Working for Home Depot was hard rewarding work. Keeping long lines moveing and making customers happy was the rewarding part, the hard part was staying at your register when I wanted to be on the floor helping customers."
good,"Great company to work with,  Many positive things from staff and management with a focus on customer satisfaction.  "
good,Enjoyed the customer interaction. The over all of the job was a fantastic learning experience. There was always something to be learned. The associates were more of a family then coworkers!
good,A typical day for me would start at 9Pm and end 5Am. i would re-stock and clean workplace. i learned how to be an independent worker without the help of a managers or supervisor. my co-workers were self motivated and workers on own assignments. No hard part of the job . Most enjoyable part of my job was the knowledge i gained.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and fellow employees however, there aren't eight days in a week. I don't mind working on the occasional Saturday but every Saturday made it impossible to have quality time with my three daughters"
good,I enjoyed working there but room for advancement opportunity was limited. Management in different department of store were supportive. Store assistant managers were supportive.
good,Great place to meet new people an to help give customers a great time they wont forget \employees was great management was great its a overall welcoming place
good,"i am happy to work with home depot. really good place to work. enjoy with coworkers, good chance to work with people from different countries."
good,Good place to work if you like fast paced environments with a lot of challenges on your time and productivity. Typical day would consist of working on new designs in 20/20. Product selection from appliances to bathroom fixtures. Maintain ongoing design and build projects. Qualify and establish budgets for clients.
good,"I have enjoyed my work experience. But desire faster advancement,"
good,"There are a lot of people that work here. Management takes care of their employees with appreciative actions. Has a high turn out rate, hard to work full time."
good,Home Depot was a great place to work. Fun people everyone is there to work and have a good time. Just working freight sucked because of the time you are required to get off.
good,Their were places that needed some communication to get resolved for customer satisfaction that I on many occasions addressed to management.
good,"Home Depot is   a wonderful company to work for. I am in the position now, with my children being grown, that I am interested in working for a company that I can retire from. "
good,I loved the environment and the associates that work there. I just wanted to head working towards what my heart is set on.
good,"Great teamwork with others at the job. Cooperation was fine."
good,"If you're willing to give customers the benefit of the doubt and are willing to crack jokes with your fellow employees, then Home Depot is fantastic.  These guys pay higher than average and give you more than 20 hours a week.  My only issue is lack of advancement, since it's hard to get full-time or into management.  But as far as retail goes, they're one of the best."
good,I would still be there today but was forced to hand in my resignation due to my needing to be home full-time as primary caregiver to my father in-law who's health was deteriorating rapidly due to Alzheimer and dementia.
good,"great place and career to endure. has great people with smiling faces and determinatiom to be great. a typical day of work can start out fun.  group stretches amd meetings about safety then everyone grabs equipment and handle their responsibilites. After 5 you can tell everyones energy has went to a notch due to long hours of standing, riding forklitfs or picking in the modules. Its not fairly hard its just repetitive and can cause a stage of bordem after pickin the same product over and over. Buty our team captin keeps us alive and lets us know where we stand throughout the day."
good,Home Depot is a great company to work for. They care about each and every associate.  The people who work for Home Depot bleed orange and want to see the company gain success because we believe in the company.
good,It is fast paced!  Lot of great interactions with customers and associates.  I look forward to the new challenges that I face everyday.
good,This was a great company to work for. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed going to work there everyday and the managers were great. They understood I wanted to go back to school and they had nothing but nice things to say. I learned a lot on that  job spoke to customers in a very nice respectful way. That had to be the most enjoyable part of the job helping customers and getting them what they needed.
good,"Working over 70 hours a week can take a toll, not only yourself but your family as well. All in all i like the opportunity that the Home Depot provided me."
good,"this was a small family owned business but after the founder, died the business shut down. The work was very steady within the company."
good,"It's a good experience, some what of a family based atmosphere. I truly learned a lot working with my Home Depot family. And no matter where my career takes me, a lot of the knowledge that I obtained there will always be with me."
good,"No complaints, it was great for college and just there after during a tough economic crisis. They were fair in their practices and I would recommend them."
good,they only hire associates part time so its very hard to become full time. Thats one of the only bad things about the company.
good,"I loved working for Home Depot. Makes you feel like you have a great sense of purpose. I was young and naive when I left. They are great in training their employees to do their specific jobs. Ive worked for various ""customer service"" retailers. And none of the work environments matched this company's sense of comodiatry."
good,Home Depot believes in their employees as well as the community.  Home Depot is flexible with work and life balance.  Home Depot cooks for the employees when things are good.  Management are good people.
good,"I really do enjoy going to work here, I learn so much about what it takes to keep up a home. I enjoy working with all of my co-workers. Here you learn something new everyday it is never a dull moment."

good,Home Depot is a great company to work for.  I have had the opportunity to work with people that respect me and all that I have to offer...There is never a dull moment.  Great perks.
good,"I am very energetic and outgoing easy to work with."
good,"Although you will send majority of your time working hard, the people make the environment fun and enjoyable. Some days are very redundant and that makes co workers more appreciated."
good,the hardest part of job was the changing from over nights to day shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers buy the right things
good,I work nights with a productive crew. The work is fairly easy. The hardest part of this job is getting used to working nights. My coworkers work well together supporting each other with whatever we're assigned. We work well as a team.
good,"I have enjoyed working for this company from day one. The associates I work with are hard working and a joy to be around. However, the management team we have is unorganized and tends to suffer from favoritism."
good,"Fun place to work, People are fantastic, management knows whats going on and will back you up if needed"
good,It has it ups and downs but when it really counts everyone is there to help.  I enjoy management is always walking around to check on things and make sure you don't have any question.
good,"Home Depot"
good,"Every day or night at The Home Depot was a joy for me. I'm passionate about gardening and I enjoyed helping our customers resolve their gardening dilemmas or design their new patio. The training was online and I could reference it at anytime. At first I was taken back by the heavy lifting of manure, sod and river rocks! But in time I got in great shape and even told my friends that I was at the gym making money! "
good,I really enjoyed working here but sometimes it was very difficult to get along with the ASMs. I LOVED my customers and I miss all the employees I worked with
good,"One day your in Electrical the next plumbing it was something diffrent everyday, Major resets we fun because you got to go to stores for several days and it was nice geting to know the people that you were doing the work for.

There was never a dull moment as the Customers kept me on my toes and I built relationships with all my customers. After 3 1/2 years I was promoted to Department Supervisor and I ran Kitchen & Bath for 1 year and then Customer Service for 1 year. The hardest part of the job was the variances in scheduling. With working Retail there is no set schedule. I enjoyed all the associates & customers and always liked teaching new things to others.
good,"Hard, heavy labor. Probaby where I got hurt. Great co workers. Some managers were great, some not so great just like anywhere.Getting everything done when you are the only one on the floor to help customers in like 3 connected department was probably the hard part When customers actually come look for you because they like you and know you know where to find everything and how to help them.Especially senior citizens.That would be the greatest feeling in the world."
good,"short hours no possibilities of promotions, high level of customer service"
good,"checkout customers at the register, answer their questions, monitor self checkout"
good,"Tough physical job, good managers and co-workers. The pay isn't that great, but there are plenty of opportunities for advancement."
good,I get to interact with great customers and provide assistance to other co-workers. The hardest part of my job is standing in one spot for m entire shift.The most enjoyable part of the job is having customers leave happy and with the thing the came to buy.
good,"Great co workers, better customers. A typical day would require you to comprehend and establish a great communication skills with management and customers, making it easier to understand and follow through the day."
good,"ran wire, installed light fixtures, and installed switches. Etc."
good,"I worked with 5 other CSRs and 2 managers. My day would start by checking in movies and putting them out on the shelves. Help customers with questions and ring them up their purchase. After working there for 6 mouths I was trained to be shift leader. Open and closed store, filled morning reports, did money drops, and help with customers. The best part of my job was working with the public."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of multitasking, case management filing, answering phones, scheduling appointments and assisting clients with housing opportunities. Staff was very supportive and coworkers was cooperative. The hardest part of the job was mentoring under privilege kids with behavioral problems who suffered from abuse."
good,"When I started working at Home Depot I started in the paint department spent 11 months in this department enjoyed helping the customers and building that close and personal connection that the company shrived for with all customers. My managers were excellent and gave me the utmost training that I needed to perform my jobs.The most enjoyable part of my job was building those relationships with customers and having them come back and personally ask for me,"
good,"Home Depot is Very unfriendly to Older managers, they are trending towards younger managers and even have an edic to employ younger salaried managers, this comes formthe top down .Great job, benefits, pay was outstanding, but security is little or none. new Store Managers are in some cases were very difficult to work with. very unfortunate for any managers over age 50. Great job but not for someone seeking a career"
good,Only worked there a year My system in which I use to log in was not operating correctly when I arrived to work one day they counted it as an absence and terminated me I had spoken with my supervisor at the time and she searched my badge log in time and showed that I logged my badge in the same time my phone logged me in which is impossible tried to fight the termination but they denied me that right so I am currently looking for new and more gainful employment
good,"Buena empresa,buenas prestaciones pero su politica de pagar poco desanimaba"
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work. The starting pay for all employees is above minimum wage, and there are many other benefits of working for this company. Employees are friendly and fun, but professional as well. Everybody does their part to make the store run smoothly, and the diversity of the customers means that you are always interacting with different and interesting people."
good,". Taking care of all customers needs and stocking."
good,everday was exciting... each day was an opportunity to learn something new.
good,I loved working here. It was always good to help the customers and learn new things about different items.
good,I have made so many friends at the Home Depot.  They have become my family.  Working with people has been rewarding.  I love the interaction.  It's hard on the feet so you need really good sneakers!
good,"A typical day at work would include restocking shelves , maintenance and customer service. This job helped me become more punctual and taught me the benefit of attention to detail. Management and my co workers were great. The hardest part of the job was working overnight and attending school in the morning. The most enjoyable part was interacting with my co workers."
good,"I was to come in and check inventory levels, to review the the last days of sales and markdowns, to make sure all work had been done from the previous day, to make sure all associate training was up to date and that any review or documentation got done. review monthly p&L statements and gave reports to                management, when it came to co-workers we always as team and they are one I will miss the most about job and the customers, I love working with them and were some but for the most part that is what I love about this job was the customers.Hardest part about my job was when I had to leave my team and my customers.Before I took over each of the department they were losing money. Within a few short month I had them making money, inventory was corrected and in a short time after that each department was on top for sales district wide. When I left the store Tool Repairs was the top performer within three districts."
good,its a productive work place you will be busy all the time helping customers.
good,it is a good and pleasant job and enjoy experience to work at and good values.
good,"As a college student, Home Depot really accommodated to my schedule. There were cookouts on major holiday's and fun things like the ""Cashier Olympics"" between all the stores in the district. Assistant store managers never stayed long, and often there were new ones."
good,"typical day at work; Providing excellent customer service, check inventory in paint isles and front face paint cans and 5 gallon buckets. Process customer paint orders (in person and on the phone), clean paint dispensers, wipe down paint desk, sweep and mop paint pit and clean up any paint or oil spills in the store. I've learned how to mix paint, how to check the inventory and how to clean up hazardous spills. My manager is fair and very informative."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty busy but satisfying in a way, for the fact that I love to help people fix their problems. The Home Depot makes all associates take classes on your department and about how to go about selling products to customers, ensuring that you sell the customers the right thing to help their problem. My co-workers are fairly good workers, but at times can be a little slow or not as up to date on things as they should be which makes my day harder. As far as management goes, we have great managers. They are always clear on what needs to be done by a certain time, and treat you well. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I have a lot of customers with problems and questions. The fact that I can answer all their questions or help fix their problems with accurate information I have learned from the classes and things I have learned from working their is the most satisfying feeling in the world."
good,I enjoyed meeting the many diverse cultured people there in Kent. It was truly a blessing to work there and learn what I did.
good,"For me a typical day working at Home Depot is great. I learn new things all the time, especially about home improvement projects. What i like most about the position as a cashier is being able to interact or converse with the customers. I like getting to work with people everyday and helping them with their needs. My co-workers are great also which make the job even better, we all get along great.It is a good company to work for."
good, 
good,"fun work place, colleagues easy to work with. "
good,Home Depot is a very large company that applies its retail formula and policies to the IT environment. This creates a very interesting and unique experience for seasoned IT professionals.
good,Home Depot is a great place to be employed. Assisting customers and making sales made the time fly. Some days we would be short handed but we always had other associates to help.
good,"its a good job, it just doesn pay enough. its 3rd shift. i like who i work for."
good,"Got to learn all about home improvement, teamwork, corporations, sales techniques, and leadership."
good,"I liked working at home depot because I always help out people with what they needed, that was always a plus. I learned so much at that job I learned how to remodel your home. I liked my co workers they were really fun to work with them. We always teamed up on helping people. The most enjoyable about the job was hearing peoples projects!"
good,A typical work day at the Home Depot consisted of clocking in and beginning work as soon as I arrived. I would look at the war board to see where I was assigned to go at that time and then I would log on to my computer and begin checking out customers.
good,"My day begins with making sure our work area is clean and safe. We offer assitance or help to our great customers with friendly,respectful,and courteous care by either directing them to items they require and loading their purchases if needed."
good,its fast paced and ur gonna spend most of your time with people in the aisles helping load setting up orders. but then they toss in a challenge like making displays and really gettin hands on... I've been here a year and LOVE it
good,this was a great place to work at come in the building and start working the management was great and also the co workers was also great the hardest part about the job is when it closed but it was veru enjoyable
good,"My day starts with our morning meeting to discuss the agenda for the day and a small warm up workout. Next i head to my dept (parts) where check my ready to work list, ship off the warranty units, followed by checking etas on incoming parts."
good,"It was like putting on a show ,bring the plants put up the sings and on Sat.--let the folks come in-you can get overwhelmed at timesbut we had good customers and a lot of fun"
good,"Sales associate, Work in building material and lumber. I help customers with everything that has to do with home improvement projects.I also cover warehouse recieving. Handle transfers, or unload frieght coming in the store."
good,Great company the housing market was the worst thing that happen to me at this location. Laid off 6700 people bummer.
good,"great place to work, wonderful people. Very slow work during the winter."
good,I always made the environment either fun or atleast enjoyable to be in. My co-worker were the best people to have a conversation with.
good,I should tells first about my knowledge in english is not enough for this mater.
good,A typical day at the Home Dept was always a different experience everyday which i thoroughly enjoyed. I learned how to advise customers in there various gardening projects. The manager were fair and treated their employees with respect and appreciation. My co-workers were equally so. The hardest part of my job was interacting with the angry cutomers or dissatified customers.
good,home depot was a great part time job.I worked there for about two years and I enjoy it. working with customer on home and garden projects.
good,Long days with learning how to deal with customers and unique ways. Most time you are your own management and I have make a lot of company calls. The employees have to depend on each other to get the job done. The hardest time is being the only one in your department and then have to cover six more department. I do like the fact that I get to work with a lot ofof new faces and people.
good,"Answered questions regarding the store and its merchandise. Computed sales prices, total purchases and processed payments. Described merchandise and explain operation of merchandise to customers. Greeted customers and ascertained customers' needs. Maintained records related to sales. Maintained knowledge of current promotions, policies regarding payment and exchanges, and security practices. Organized company files and creating support system to decrease workload and increase productivity of account managers."
good,"Great co-workers,but high turnover in mid level management- little to no support or training"
good,"Everyone is nice to work with, a good work atmosphere and culture. Downside is that you can be cancelled, for budgetary or due to rain. The reason the weather was important is because business was slow during bad weather and so hours were often cut."
good,A typical day at work began with making sure my cash drawer had enough money in it for the whole entire day. If not a change order needed to be ordered. I love their computer/register functions. I learned many things like what time contractors go to shop and much more. All of my co-workers were very nice. The hardest part of my job I have to say was making sure that I was always going the fastest possible but without making customers feel rushed out.. The most enjoyable part of my job I believe was working with the customers. I am a people person.
good,"great place to work,possibility of advancemnent"
good,"I had a great time working with Home Depot. The people were really nice, and I feel like I learned a lot by working there, ranging from product knowledge to life values. I had a problem with one of the workers at my store, but it was carefully noted by my manager and overall taken care of."
good,Customer service is the number one goal at the The Home Depot. Second managing your personell within your department making sure that they are tasked with the appropriate jobs at all times while caring for each customer who comes thorough the door. The hours can be long and the compensation can be on the lower end for department heads. My most enjoyable part of the job was learning the entire busines aspect of a major retail store and how the distribution of products was recieved from the venders and sold to the the consumers in such a professional manner.
good,"The company loved to see people advance and as long as you were trying your best it was easy to move up. Taking care of the customers and keeping positive was the best recommendation for advancement that you could have. I got on well with most of the management. Some were very quiet and not friendly which I am sure could have been part of the company policy about becoming to close. Driving the heavy lift equipment was the hardest part for me, but I did it and though I never loved it. I also never had a accident. Working with the customers was my favorite, I still have some customers that stop me on the street and ask how things are to this day."
good,Home depot was an excellent place to work and I enjoyed my 3yrs with the company. Wish i could have still been team Depot. But store 1858 Store manager needs to be fired and accountable for what he does to the employees and how he treats them. I have no complaint on overall company or other associates.
good,"Home Depot offered an fun working environment. They gave you freedom to handle your own department not too much micro-managing which is a pet peeve. Best part was learning to operate the forklift which I got very good at. the worst part was lifting all the paint cans and stocking them, hard work but fun workout."
good,It is a good work place to work. I gained a lot of experience in costumer services.
good,Working at the Home Depot is a great experience in my opinion. The good being that there is so much to learn that you can always learn something new everyday. The slight downside is having no set schedule so the varying shifts can be draining quite often.
good,"TheHome Depot is a great bussiness, but because of its diversity alot of the employers are not really bussiness oriented and alot of un fair judgements get called plus the fact without a union there is not much can be done about it."
good,"If you’re a female you’ll deal with a lot of the male customers harassing you. Other than that the days go by smoothly. You’ll often be in and out like you hope to be. My coworkers are super nice too, there’s almost no drama here."
good,Home Depot care about associates as well as its customers. Very hard to move up in the company unless you know someone or you make yourself noticeable.
good,Needs to be more flexible with associates needs in terms of scheduled hours for part time associates . overall a great company to work for. they have Great company party's.
good,"I worked for the Home Depot for a short time due to physical limitations but they were great to work for. Other workers were friendly, the customers were great, they provided varied working environments. The only drawback was that some of the managers were not very friendly or good to work for,  but those managers are no longer at this particular location.  The other drawback was they were unable or unwilling to work with me with my physical limitations and I had to quit because of it."
good,This is a place you can grow.  I have been there 15 years and been to 5 stores. Alot of moving around.  I would say Home Depot is a good company if your open to change and wanting to always learn.
good,"It was fun to work there, but i was unable to get the hours and wage that I needed to sustain myself.  Its a basic retail job, but with a large enough team that your schedule is very flexible."
good,"The culture and what the company stands for are terrific.  As a whole, they are a family and all associates look after each other and take care of one another."
good,"I found that the work environment was great, people are great, but the actual job is stressful. Because it gets so busy, you are stressed to help everyone out. Normally I'm pretty good with that, but here it became TOO busy. There are sometimes not enough people working in your department and you have to answer all peoples questions, bring people to what they're looking for, answer the phone, do orders on the computer, and cut blinds, etc for them too. It is more fast paced then they lead you to believe. But the company is GREAT! If it wasn't so stressful I would've enjoyed it a lot more."
good,"Get in what you get out. If you want to go and do the day in and day out and nothing else, then you'll do fine with job security. If you want to advance, work hard, communicate your goals, and work toward them daily."
good,"I enjoyed my time with the Home Depot. Job advancement seemed unlikely, but this place has a fantastic employee culture. I am grateful for the time I spent at this business."
good,When I first started I had a wonderful store manager that would come in a speak to each and every employee in the store and the all of the managers I started with have been transferred to other stores and the place went down hill. And then when an employee does something wrong they want to fire them  but it's ok for the manager to do it its ok
good,"You guys are awesome! Best job experience I've had by far! It's that time of the year! Team work and Communication #1! Get it MET, you're the backbone and you know it!"
good,Fun work place. Quiet environment. When I first arive at work I always check my computer and the thing I know are urgent and need to get done asap. Then go through my zma bin and then follow through with my plans for the day
good,"Very friendly co workers , we put always give Great customer service. Management cares for their employees hardest part of this job unsatisfied customers that cant get/find the product in store  best part encouraging customers and employees"
good,"my job is fun and also is a workout from picking orders wrapping them, banding them, making sure its well covered to be shipped out the following day."
good,"Thank yoy for give me this oportunitty like work hart thast my experience. I love stacker o houkepper o eny one have they ihave available houkepper is my. Im ready to start to work eny day they needme"
good,"Home Depot warehouse was great to work for, however, they start you off seasonal, and you getting a permanent spot depends on how much your managers like you, more than how hard you work. The pay was good, the incentives to work hard are nice, and the culture is cool!"
good,"After having transferred between 3 departments, I get pulled from my current one to help all over the store. I don’t mind because it keeps me busy and not just standing around. A lot is expected and when you stand out, even more so. It’s a fast paced environment and I have a lot of fun most days I’m at work."
good,"Multiple departments that allow you to find your niche while working towards advancement in the company.  The benefits, schedule, and culture are outstanding."
good,I been working for the Home Depot for almost 7 years and enjoyed my time here but based off of all the work I do and they expect from you I believe they should pay more. The company is a billion dollars corporation I feel like starting pay at 15 is not bad at all
good,The management team is always on task and the employees are friendly most of the time. I really liked it here. The pay wasn’t so great but it’s not much coming from me since I only worked there part time.
good,"I love working at the home depot, staff is amazing, The benefits can be better for part time associates. The company can be improved all together but all in all a great company."
good,"Liked it there. It was good to help people! Good structure and guidence. Training was super. Interactions with customers was the best.  Managing inventory was always a challenge and a big focus of store management. "
good,20 years of taking care of associates and customers. Love the brand. Great company that allows us to give back to the community that we live in. Open door policy allows everyone to feel comfortable.
good,It's a job I could of still been there but they didn't feel that way so they let me go over something stupid but it's cool because everything happens for a reason
good,I love my job and the personal relationships I get to build with customers. It’s unlike any other retail job I’ve ever worked. Management tried their best to stick up for you when there are issues
good,my my favorite jobs I absolutely loved the hours and the opportunity for advancement but I did not enjoy the new management and the changes after that it was a lot of work but the pay was absolutely worth it
good,I found this job way of the realm of my interests and knowledge but was able to get in there and do my job effectively.  It was a rather hectic position but kept me moving and busy.
good,It's good the job was alright but the breaks were Short and the pay was good I worked in both the cashier and the lumber department it was also a good experience.
good,I love the Home Depot. Unfortunately they don’t pay enough money for any to stay. That’s the reason they hire high school kids that don’t need to make anything.
good,"A day at the Home Depot was to take care of customers, keep your aisles stocked and kept neat and clean to make it easy for customers to find what they were looking for. Management was always readily available to assist if needed. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday and working alongside great team players."
good,"It was a good starting job, the management and is poor and can be very difficult to work with. But at the end of the day its a job and can get paid to work and deal with them"
good,The Home Depot has a wonderful family environment to a workplace setting. Each member are there to help each other provide the best quality experience for the customer.
good,As I would start my shift it was fairly busy then it got really slow. I love the people I work with but there is some drama there that needs to be worked on. Overall it’s a decent job.
good,keep up with stocking and answering questions from customers to help them get what they need for their specific needs  help other departments when yours is slow.
good,Have been working for this company 5 years I love working for Home Depot our district manager is very humble and doesn’t discourage anyone many events and they are courteous to there associates
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working there. Management is very supportive. willing to help you even when going through a personal crisis."
good,"Everyone is really friendly I love every minute working at the Home Depot!"
good,"It sucks that there is no benifets or any thing for part timers and they only hire part time help at HD there is no full time work less your high up on the corporate ladder "
good,"I always enjoyed working with the public. I am a people person, and get along with everyone. I love the aspect of helping people and having them leave with a smile on their face knowing I gave them the best possible treatment that I could offer."
good,"Different departments collaborated with the MET team.  Store was not fully staff at all times and customers often misunderstood our role as merchandisers, perhaps, different color t-shirts other than orange would have been better for the MET team."
good,I have been working for home depot for eight years and it's been a great company to work for and gain experience. It has allowed me to pursue my education of becoming a college graduate in computer science.
good,"management was very polite and professional.he ask for any one who has a question to ask,,, before leaving the room.the co-worker are very helpful"
good,"I want the Home Depot to pay the workers standard wage of $15 an hour, because there is too much to be done than what the associates get. With regards to work experience I have learnt much."
good,Really good at great expectations I’m definitely a peoples person I really love working there I enjoyed helping the customers conversatiing with them as well
good,I enjoyed the associates I worked with. They were all friendly and helpful. As a tool rental associate the work was fast paced and involved a lot of physical lifting. Much was expected by the customers with little gratitude. Some of the customers were very difficult to work with. I will just leave it at that.
good,Home Depot is a great place to work if you are looking for part time work.  From the short time I was there the money didn’t seem to be fair amongst the employees.  Sales goals in the flooring department seem a bit unrealistic.
good,"I enjoyed the management and co-workers, the option to advance to full time was hard. I trained on forklift and other equipment, also the hours were great."
good,Iittle pay for hard over work Home depot see should consider paying cashier little bit better. Cashier takes to much verbal abuse from customers some head cashier can be very pleasant. Assist managers are amazing
good,this is stupid i just want to go back to job searching indeeed you are wasting my time by forcing my to fill out theses long reviews on company's i use to work for make your surveys  a lot shorter or optional
good,"Great workers , takes time to get to know everything in the store , have to dedicate yourself to this job to get paid what u need in order to make money for bills or at least work 40hrs , but over all the company is wonderful and the people are wonderful too I enjoyed it and would recommend others to work there too"
good,I enjoyed my time at home depot. It was good job to have when I needed two jobs during the summer. I only worked for one summer but the managent helped me work around my complications.
good,my managers were great but the company could do better and it would stsrt with higher pay and discounts on the stuff in the store. the fact that i have to get my dad to use his military discount to save money is really pathetic!
good,"mostly an enjoyable job, stressful some days, exciting on other days. very flexxible hours and the management was very kind and caring. very patient with everyone. the only negative was they were constantly under staffed which lead to many issues."
good,"None at all I have nothing to say about this job. I leave it how it is, the job is good n peaceful that all I got to say about this job and the entire environment about it."
good,"I enjoyed work for Home Depot until they transferred me to the Customer Service counter. "
good,"I give a 5 because of Home Depot's advancement opportunities and Benefits. "
good,I loved working here it was amazing. i got paid great while working there. i would suggest this job for anyone! everyone should try to apply. Great job
good,Pretty much what i said in the title. When new management took over the whole process and system was flipped. As one of the most productive lp groups in the country. We management felt they needed to put their stamp on our job and change what was providing results
good,"Great company, great benefits! Pay could be better. The people I work with are great, and everyone is very helpful. They will train you in any department and always promote from within the store first. So, if you don't advance it's your in fault."
good,"There is a great enviotment; however, employees were eiyhwr over worked with little pay or they did not recognize those who actually did their job. Management needs to take a stand and draw boundaries."
good,Going to work on a everyday i was stocking learning everyday on how to drive a forklift learning on thing go around home depot mamagrment was great the workplace culture was great
good,Working at the the home depot was very fun for me while i was in school. Cashier work isn’t hard at all. They are reliable and the work is fast placed thursday-saturday
good,"Checking for safety of aisles and proper securement of merchandise. Cleanliness of department work space & displays. Customer interaction and problem solving in person and on phone. Stocking shelves."
good,Management could be better instead they create their own groups of favorite employees. Managers and supervisors don't hear new employees they treat us temps very bad and hurtful.
good,"Management is generally laid back and fair. Until something needs to be done, then it is your responsibility if you are a hard worker, if you are not they ignore you and let your behavior go un punished."
good,If you have a good team of coworkers it's fun but lack of support and training from management is not very prevalent. Also pay is not conducive to cost of living in this area.
good,"It's fun working there and all, but sometimes it's a bit hard trying to communicate with other departments. I still love working there and the people are great. You get to experience new kind of people every day and you learn a lot of new stuff. Unfortunately our work schedule could change and we wouldn't really know it. I was told we were suppose to get a call or text when it does but so far never really receive one so now I would have to check my schedule a few times a day just to make sure nothing has really changed. You do get a raise for every year your with Home Depot but that depends on how much you've done. Some people told me they got from 43 - 69 cent raises just depending on their work performances. I have been with them for almost a year, but I can't really live off of $12 per hour in my area. It may sound greedy but I just need something a little more like $13 or even maybe $14 an hour in this area."
good,Working at Home Depot was fun and met some really great people. I became a paint supervisor through hard work and dedication. I recommend working here.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find what they were looking for. The hardest part of the job was trying to go fast and meet all the requirements in doing general service in the bays through out the store.
good,"	Ensure the store is stocked and ready for business every day using bay directed pack down protocols."
good,"Great company,great company great company company great company great Company would love that but it was always a good time with you succeed in mortga"
good,"Great place to work, good people and management. Laid back but everyone works to get the job completed. Management is good about recognizing the employees efforts."
good,"Depending on what area (department) you work in it can be a whole lot of fun. There's a great deal of team work and support among co-workers. The company is currently going through some realignment so a number of positions are on the line with some employees being displaced. The hardest part with working at HDE is having the opportunity to advance beyond your current position/department. It's not always easy getting a foot in unless you know people up the chain, but there are still ways to circumvent that by attending training, seminars, focus groups and most importantly Networking."
good,"The Home Depot has taught me a lot and is managed well. "
good,"talking every day with cusotmers"
good,"The Home Depot is a solid place to work, with great possibilities for advancement. They have locations around the world. It is a company that you can be proud to work for!"
good,"Great place to work, wonderful culture and people that truly care about the company.  Long hours, weekends and holidays.  Great leadership and always trying to take care of the customer."
good,"It was a great experience to learn customer service via The Home Depot. I learned to handle cash on the register, and also to balance my till. Perhaps the only thing that can be said is that, they should probably screen incoming workers a bit better. You had very professional workers, along side some very untrustworthy characters. Overall it was an eye opener to work at The Home Depot."
good,"As long as you are doing your job well nobody bothers you. The manager always briefs the associates before the shift. "
good,"I worked at Home Depot for three years, it was fun at times and demanding at times.  It wasn’t a place that was understanding when family issues came up.  The pay was ok."
good,Finding a fit within the organization culture. MOST friendly and helpful few individuals NOT. Keep your nose to the grind stone and work. Volunteering most helpful. Customer Service is tantamount !
good,"The people you work with are awesome (for the most part). Benefits are great for part timers. I enjoyed my job there every single day and wish I could still work there. But the new mgmt was out for the long time associates, to either fire them or make them quit. Per the comment by one ASM, we now have a 20 something mgr in each dept and will be the biggest baddest store in this region. Not an environment I wished to remain in. Sorry it happened that way."
good,"Working at The Home Depot, I would help in unloading freight on a nightly basis, by hand or with the use of a pallet jack. I was put in charge of overseeing my coworkers, and making sure that the merchandise being unloaded was distributed to it's proper location,(pallets and carts). Once we finished unloading the trailer, each of us were given a certain department to distribute and stock merchandise to it's proper location. What I did not like about working at The Home Depot was that management was not fair with all of it's employee's, and management and department supervisors had favorites, which made it very difficult to work for this company."
good,There was a breakdown of communication between the Met Team and Management team which caused the job to be a little more harder than it should have been.
good,The Home Depot is a very family oriented company. Everyone has to be a team player to provide excellent customer service. When everyone is in place it’s fast paced but smooth sailings as well.
good,I have been here for almost two years and I really liked it. It's an easy job with plenty to do. If you're comfortable around people and if you're really good at doing the same thing all day at a nice steady pace then you will like it here.it can be a bit of a challenge but if you are willing to teach yourself about the store and where things are and what they do then you'll be set.
good,"you work hard, sometimes the hours are long but as long as you have a great leader in your department it is worth it."
good,"It is a decent work environment, however the constant interruptions and intrusions, costs valuable design time. Management can be helpful but often is under experienced and trained in modern management skills."
good,"The company itself is a very good company to work for. I have been with the company for approximately 18 months as a merchandise associate, I have not worked store side during my time with the company but I do like how the store manager and his team run the store. The district supervisor for the merchandising team is a difficult person to work under. I enjoy what I do for the most part but when I am told that I can't even speak to a regular customer it makes it difficult to continue enjoying what I do."
good,"If you get a great management team, the job is great. But if you don’t a decent management team then the job is not great. The company values are great and very respectful of their employees"
good,"stocking products to their right spot.  i have learnt to be able to work indepently, at a faster rate and work within time. Every associate is given the opportunity to work at his or her own pace."
good,"My days at the home depot were great for the most part."
good,"Very fast paced! Customers could be pretty nasty at times. You need to have lots of patience working here as well! lol Overall, it is a good company to work for."
good,I worked at Home Depot for a few years. It was a good company to work for and it taught me a lot of things. I learned how to setup different departments.
good,Home Depot is stressful for a working student but overall a good job I think it’s great we have leave for people with mental health struggles. Managers care for employees.
good,"It's a nice place if you want to start a career and grow with in the company. Co workers, management/ all staffs are awesome. Feels like HOME. plus benefits."
good,Home Depot is a good place to work if you want to advance your career with the company and a great place to work if your looking to supplement your income with part time
good,"Wow, this was one of the best retail jobs I've ever had, and best companies I've ever worked for. This company is not perfect, but takes care of their employees through profit sharing twice a year. It may not be a lot of money, but it consists of: a meeting with food, music, and constant recognition. They go all out for their Holiday Party. "
good,"Home depot is a fun place. My typical day is standing behind a cash register, I have learned that tolerance is extremely important in this work environment. "
good,working there was a great experience it was just hard to get a full  time position even if you were qualified and been there a long time other than that it was a great job
good,Great place to work fun and friendly environment. It was like a family with the other coworkers. Work was fun helping customers it was something new everyday
good,"This was a great place to work. I learned a lot of things there. I worked as a door greater first , then i went to garden and i moved up to hardware, i was going to go to lost prevention, but my dad took I’ll and i had to stop working there to take care of him and my mom."
good,"Great Company, always has a Homer Pantry encase you forgot your lunch or needed a snack. Easy going environment. Great managers. Was a great learning opportunity"
good,Buena empresas pero aveces la gente que está como líder no hace ameno el trabajo y eso lo vuelve un poco más difícil
good,Great place to work. The associates are valued. Home Depot takes care of their customers but most importantly they take care of the associates. Enjoyed working.
good,"The Home Depot is an overall good company to work for. There are a few opportunities in my current building, but overall have a great relationship with my peers and continue to learn a lot as a leader in the building. I have a great group of associates that I learn a lot from as well. I'm just looking for greater promotional opportunities."
good,"Home Depot is a good company to work for if you are lacking in education.    You have a chance to move up.  If you are educated and make the company money as I have - you never get asked to move up. You have to push and the folks you are working for are ambivalent because they do not want to lose you.   Not how a typical company is. Usually the cream rises to the top, not in my particular location. Here they promote problems out of the building. ."
good,"Great environment. Everyone is friendly, you can rely on your managers. There's always something to do. The hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting."
good,"Love the company, love the associates. Fun place to work for hourly associates. However, salary leadership team wasn’t treated fairly and did not have a “work life balance “"
good,"Everyday i go straight to the service desk to work customer service. It is consist work and at a moderate pace. I handle returns and check out at one end of the desk and then on the other end i answer calls, handle orders and deliveries."
good,"Wonderful place to work, fast paced, great co-workers and management. I learned ALOT from working with caring people and made me a stronger person for it"
good,"I was in charge of training all new employee's on how to read a planogram, clean a bay, stock a bay and make it presentable. I also trained individuals on how to run Bit, this is the price changing program that must be done everyday. There are EPC and ADS that must be done before 10 am everyday. I am in charge of 3 showrooms. Flooring, cleaning, stocking and ordering samples of stone and formica tops for the show room. Kitchen and Design, cleaning, stocking and ordeing samples for the show room. Millworks, clean, and stock brochures, order new brochures as needed."
good,"Every day is an adventure at the Depot.  Different customers, different challenges, lot of rewards helping customers with their projects.  Team Depot is an amazing way to give to the community and help the Veterans."
good,I don't have any complaints regarding home depot. Home Depot is a well kept organization that is continuing to grow and expand its business. It does't take long to advance with the company but it does take hard work and dedication. I was set to build my career with Home Depot but had to settle due to a family emergency. I would recommend any hard working person to pursue their Career with Home Depot. You have many advantages but the only problem is the pay rate.
good,I like the fact that its not just the part time and full time workers out on the floor. You see the managers helping out and being present. Other places you may rarely see the managers or the ASMs walking around or just helping customers.
good,Fast paced but fun work environment.  People were very friendly. Learned to do different jobs to help out when needed.  The hardest part was having to leave
good,Great company to work for but as a part time worker I could not afford to live off my paycheck from just one source of income. Full time positions are filled by promoting part time employees with more seniority despite actual qualifications or by transferring existing full time employees from other departments or other stores.
good,"Customer service is key"
good,"Working at Home Depot is pretty easy depending on the department you are in. They do ask more of you that you can give. Responsibilities of other Dept fall on you if someone is missing , short staff etc."
good,"First couple of months were very nice. I met new friends and still talk to them till this day.  Being a cashier isn't that hard, unless you give a hard time with customers and or have a bad attitude. Overall it is a fun environment to work in and you get lots of future benefits."
good,"good place to work. "
good,Good work experience had fun working with staff.
good,I loved the position I had. It taught me more about the products that were sold in the store. The PRO desk was very helpful for the most of all unknown questions I couldn't answer.
good,Home Depot was a great company to escalate within the company to make more money. Reviews were always positive and the company itself always keep you updated on your progress.
good,"Training was minimal, easy environment. Nice people to work with but upper management was hard to find as they had huge workloads. They would benefit from more help."
good,"I enjoyed my customer service position, helping people to envision a final product. Communication skills were often challenging with husbands and wives not agreeing with one another, but always managed to please both when the final decision was made."
good,"Home depot is a fun place to work if you are single without kids. As a single parent it was very hard balancing personal life and work life since there is no set schedule. In a typical work week I would open 2 days out the week, close 2 days out the week, and work a mid shift on the 5th day of the week. There was no stability and there was no consistency in scheduling"
good,Loved working at The Home Depot. Fast paced. Lots of training on a computer. Ability to meet all walks of life. 
good,good place to work. hours vary so there is no set schedule. Company waste too much time on unnecessary competitions between store which take away labor hours and expense from the stores.
good,go clock in..then to your department...customer service is most important....stock shelves....clean area...walk around ask for customer assistance.....
good,"If all you want is a part time job, Home depot is a great place to work. The environment at my store was very friendly. However, the pay is not the best. Being a freight handler is very much a behind the scenes job."
good,Great place to work - just no hours  
good,The hardest part of this job is that they need more equipment to assist with the customers orders.  Some of the managers have no leadership skill but the majority does.
good,"As any retail job, some days are slow, however; most days are fast paced and go bye quickly. You're usually always busy. I constantly recommend friends and family to apply. The managers and other associates are very nice."
good,Work/life balance is awful as an assistant manager.  The company is great and I would recommend trying to work there in most roles.  The assistant manager job is not difficult it is just time consuming and tiring hours wise.
good,You walk at least 1500 steps a shift. Most people are friendly you get to learn a lot about products and you meet some interesting people. The vending machines are usually sold out however.
good,Home Depot was a good place to work. Friendly people and great company. really cares about the employees and their families and communities. Needs better benefits though for part timers.
good,Most days of show up to work and just mind my own business and get my job done so I can move on to the next step on the day most the time that meant going on a delivery
good,loved it.it was excellent.evryone was positive and everyone made great progress.worked at our own pace as long as we got done by the dead line.i want to work here again
good,Great Company Only problem outside sales required me to Drive over 1200 miles a week with no gas allowance enjoyed job fuel cost and long hours were to much.
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"Great place to work if you are patient. They offer the tools for advancement, as long as you have the drive needed to move up. Would definitely recommend"
good,"Responsable,honesta,buena actitud,respetuosa,leal entusiasta"
good,I worked on the freight team here and had a wonderful supervisor. The expectations were always clear and the management was never unfair about issues that occurred. The one issue I had working here was with other members of the freight team not pulling their weight. In this particular department no one could leave until all of the work was done and the store was back in working order. Unfortunately there were many times where other members of the team would not do their share causing the rest of us to pick up the slack
good,Home depot is a great place to work. it is a family atmosphere and they celebrate the employees well. I am still friends with many of the co-workers that I met while working there.
good,"You work flexible hours, and have to maintain a strong presence for customers service tasks. But for the most part the job is not very hard, and you will have coworkers of all ages. Its a very diverse and caring environment, though management is messy."
good,Working for Home Depot was a great experience. It was a home away from home. We were all a big team and everyone was striving to give excellent customer service. That was the base of the working environment. Educate yourself with the products and services to better serve your customers.
good,"I was a cashier at Home Depot and it was a stress-free, easy going job. Their scheduling is very flexible and willing to work with you. Also, a great paying job!"
good,"I was looking for something other than grocery when I went to work for this company and in all honesty the only reason I excepted employment here was due to the HR manager. She was an amazing person who had visions the same as mine about customer service so I accepted their offer, but like most companies everything is political and based on who you know not what you know so unfortunately  it got very old very fast"
good,I am a cashier in a fast paced work environment. Breaks are regulated and breaks up the work day nicely. Management is accommodating and easy to work with.
good,The point system should be reevaluated especially for part time/temp. employees. I always volunteered to come in early and stay late and to work more than 20-30hrs per week. I had some family concerns that I kept them notified about and because the point system was not explained to me in great detail I lost my job because I needed more time off when my grandmother past away. Immediately after her passing my mother fell and broke both ankles and I was the only care provider and being a single mom with a 1 1/2 yr old son. I wish more options were explained to me. I really loved working there and was devastated when I lost my job.
good,i was the operational manager that had six departments and 132 employees that reported tho me. I learned how to prioritize task. The management team was always there for me. I really enjoyed everything about Home Depot.
good,greeat customer service its a nice place to work people are nice costomers are great no day is the same so its all ways a great place to shop they have great deals
good,"I was an associate in garden department. Provided Costomers  with advice about products their individual needs and requests. Loading of costomer purchases, stocking of garden department or where needed. Cleaning and maintenance of department and store in general. Ilearned to use store phone for stoking and inventory. Managers where good. Good workplace Culture. Hardest part of job was loading of heveay items. Most enjoyable part of job was helping customers."
good,"The world and life balance is great, as well as the benefits. The pay isn't that great but the job has it's simplicity. The management of the store is quite poor as the store itself lack employees. Advancement is hard to gain throughout the store. Overall, Home Depot is is decent if you need a part-time gig for a short period of time. I would not consider it being a career."
good,Very cut throat management team. Great place to work as an hourly associate. Company focuses on customer service. Fast pace work environment with a focus on customer service.
good,"The Home Depot has one of the best cultures! Anyone looking to become a part of something fast - paced, inclusive and dedicated to customer service will love it.  "
good,"Does not pay a livable wage. Hours are always there but due to company restrictions and office politics, you'll never get said hours. Unless you're fulltime AND certified in a bunch of HD specific training, don't plan on making this a career."
good,"Muy buena empresa para laborar, muy buen control sobre su proceso administrativo, solamente unos fallos hacia sus recursos humanos, una excelente empresa para aprender sobre procesos, ventas, y el uso de recursos."
good,advancement was great! the opportunities are wonderful and would work for them again. the place is great and wonderful people. The company training is great!
good,I made good friends at the home depot.  The home depot has good benefits for employee. it's hard to get promoted within the company. The Home depot does n't have proper training for new employees.
good,"I had completed advancement testing and training, and had even been accepted to move up from part time hours to full time hours of work...but the management wouldn't allow me to move forward in hours of work, yet they moved younger employees into full time hours though they had less working experience than my earned hours."
good,"Good company with very good people.  Limited advancement potential.  It's retail so you need to be able to work with the public, which is not always easy.  Getting a full-time position can also be a challenge but can come with time and experience."
good,I enjoyed working for home depot untill the last manager was promoted.she didn' get like me. she would harrass me when i was on break. when i called in the last time she said if i did'come in that night i was terminated. i told her it was family issues and she said you are fired.She told other workers that i just stoped coming in and that was a lie.
good,"magmnt had their favorites it was an ok company to work for. "
good,"THD was a great experience, the care for their people and go out of the way to ensure that everyone has the tools to do their jobs.They create a true team environment where everyone get a say."
good,"Awesome Company! I regret leaving The Home Depot. I Just wish the pay was better. The staff was awesome, if you needed help with anything, there was always someone else who could help or guide you in the right direction."
good,"Its pretty cool and it has some really nice employees"
good,I mean I had monitor setbacks when I had to switch my availability but other than that it's a great place to work. I wish they would hire for full time more.
good,"It is very fast paced, so the shifts go quickly. You are constantly learning new things about products and people. The toughest parts of the job is dealing with upset customers and life balance. (You're required to work all shifts and weekends.)"
good,It is very fast paced place from the start of my day with very little lull time. Just trying to get the customer in and out as fast as we can and insure they are happy and satisfied with the service provided to them. I have learned so much working there and still learn something new every day. It is a very stress free place to work and the people are great. I have always enjoyed working with the public so as much as they are a favorite part of my day sometimes I would have to say they also don't make it the funnest or easiest.
good,"A typical day at work was great there was no problems, everybody did their job. things that I learned was better ways to complete job tasks.  My managers are very friendly and very understanding."
good,Home depot was a great to work with a good management team except for two managers who are very disrespectful when addressing their associates. The work is good and keeps you busy and you build great relationships with people in the store.
good,"Excellent company with great benefits. Management was very disappointing but great job advancement, good enviroment and employees really know how to work as a team"
good,"I worked in Garden Center. Watered plants several times a day. Interacted with customers. Learned a lot about fertilizers, plants, landscaping and horticulture."
good,Working for The Home Depot has provided flexibility in my school/work life. Management has been fair and supportive. I have learned skills that will help me in other job opportunities.
good,The workplace was good. I was cashier and customer representative there. They laid me off after Christmas holiday. I didn't have job security. Since it was a part time I don't have any benefits. I learned a lot about how to handle tough customer.There is nothing to learn in that job.
good,home depot is a great place to work the benefits are horrible but over all a great place. customers are not that bad and mostly respectful. the management there are the best .
good,"This place is fast paced.  It is a sink or swim place.  Home Depot has competitive wages, however there are high expectations from each and every person.  Home Depot treats all their employees with respect, however, the manager can be somewhat unprofessional and/or not ready for the role they have."
good,great place to work at. everyone is very helpful will to go above and beyond to assist on finding want someone may need are looking for at that time. speed of service is great also.
good,I worked at the company part-time making decent money and the company while not great was ok to work. Typical work day was usually busy because customers came in constantly but the management was nice.
good,Good. Comfortable place to work. People are nice. Easy going atmosphere. Training classes are sufficient. They appreciate their employees give good awards and benefits.
good,"Great way to meet customers and help them fulfill their ideas and dreams. Plenty of chance to learn new things, Hard work, definitely not an office job."
good,"The Home Depot is a great company to work for but they don't pay very well. Full time employees have a chance of moving up the corporate ladder, slowly. It's a good part time job. And first job"
good,The Home Depot has locations all over the USA and the opportunity to advance is limitless!  Some of the executives started as Lot Associates/Cashiers and are now Presidents/Vice Presidents.
good,Home Depot is a nice place to work for but I am ready to start my career in a different field. I like that they are willing to work with me and train me in business but I am ready to move on with my life.
good,"capacitación del personal, manejo del personal para conteos cíclicos y hacer planograma de mercadeo de los departamentos así como atender a clientes especiales"
good,"Shallotte store has a good crew. Management is wishy washy. Each store will be different, only as good as the management team. I enjoyed the team, but was challenged in a not so good way with the upper management."
good,I worked in the garden dept and it was nice to be able to work outside with the plants and the people that love to garden. I learned a lot about yard upkeep equipment and all kinds of plants. I did have some heavy lifting but that kept me strong. The hardest part was when the weather was hot or extremely cold.
good,"Simply unskilled labor for a decent wage.  I learned a lot about piping, conduit, gardening, tools, and much more in the short time I have worked here."
good,"Was in charge of all of the shrinks the store had and responsible for making sure the stores assets were protected, such as store products,employee and keeping a safe work environment for other workers. Learned a lot while working for this company but wanted to keep on moving forward so I went on to the construction field to persuade towards my career in business management"
good,Home depot is a great place to work with amazing benefits and great management. I would recommend it to a friend or family member. They are semi- flexible with the schedule though.
good,"While not as fun as Lowes, I enjoyed my time at Home Depot. It was not as much as a family as other jobs I have had and the grubby llok of the stores kinda bothers me."
good,The workplace environment is pleasant. Anyone who wants to apply should. There benefits are also good. The work hours are steady. They have partime and fulltime hours.
good,A typical day at HomeDepot is very relaxed if you have the right team members its very easy. Managemnt are very supportive and there is a great work/life balance.
good,"hours are very varied.  some nights, weekends, early mornings..  Advancement for part time employees does not exist. Hourly wages are minimum, insurance benefits for part timers are expensive and just do not work.. If a short time part time job is what you are looking for , this will probably work, with no expectations of advancement.."
good,"Loved this job.Go through so many managers tho. You would think this company would have changed their policies by now. Your job life and real life doesn't balance, no time with family because inconsistent work our for the Department supervisors. I feel if you been with a company for more than five years at least give your associates the opportunity for a set schedule. I promise once this company understand that balance their turn over rate wouldn't be so high."
good,"I love working at the home depot , I work with a great group of people in a fun atmosphere, The supervisors work well with the employees should something arise in the family and you need time off to deal with it."
good,"I like working for Nordstrom at was a good paying job commission was very good ,  I love working for a fashion it's beautiful to work there Good times"
good,Good work place but their sop rules are horrible and contradicting and management needs to improve on communication with each other. But it depends what store and what management is there.
good,i learn the been responsible for something like with this business is great because is good to be responsible when my manager gave me a independent job is great to work alone and with group.
good,Home Depot strives to provide a nurturing culture around its employees. They have a lot of programs in place for employee moral. My only problem with working here is it is retail hours. Also unless you are high level management you cannot make a decent living.
good,great environment fun at times lots of work some days management wants you to do someone else's work depending on your location the pay can make you or break you.
good,"Good place to work. Good health benefits for part-timers. Open door management, Career goals, job training. Home Depot is hands down the best home improvement company, employing experienced professionals in their stores to help you get a project completed. Huge company. DO well here and you can go anywhere."
good,"Great Employment Opportunity.Fast paced work environment that teaches you day by day and step by step. Great management team,helpful coworkers. the job is genuinely enjoyable."
good,The Home Depot is an exciting place to work. Everyone is extremely helpful and is always aiming to please the customers. There is an adequate amount of training to help prepare for your position.
good,"Customer service to an outstanding level. Always courteous and ready to help in any way possible to keep the customers happy."
good,"Working here I thoroughly enjoyed my co-workers as I was a Vault "
good,Lots of Work and good people. Work can be quite rewarding with the many advancement opportunities the company offers. Pay is fair and competitive.
good,Everybody got along like a family and the management are nice and of u needed to go to the with a problem they will solve it as quick as possible and they are a family based company
good,Enjoyed working there until i was transferred to a store that wasnt so inviting cool schedule and great benefits overall ppl and staff was a great team i worked on the MET Team when i was there.
good,Great beginner job with high energy and friendly people. Customers have just as much fun as the employees. Hectic when busy but the hrs fly. Very respectable place to work.
good,"Loved the job, schedules horrible though. Hard to see family or have a life outside of work. Lots of on the job training. Inclusive atmosphere. Pay compensation vs. horrible schedules, not worth it."
good,This is a great job. One of my favorite jobs. I would have stayed if they offered full-time. It is mostly part-time positions. I learned about all kinds of home improvement stuff. Really super fun.
good,"designed kitchens and baths,  Also specialized in flooring and installs,   in-store blinds and special order. Daily customer service . Team work and organizing product within  the store"
good,"Working here taught me how to handle myself in very difficult situations. Being a pro cashier meant you had to know your items, where they were and what the price was. Taught me how to work at a very fast pace and how to work alone. Management was great considering the fact that they tried to make everyday special and fun."
good,"I was very happy to go to work at the Seekonk Home Depot after months of job search and to be of fairly immediate acknowledgment that the bulk of the other inside sales force was of the same general age bracket as I and it was only to out customer's benefit that we were as it makes it easier for them to approach and to speak to us and the reverse as well, for us to approach them. "
good,"I enjoyed the work putting away inventory . I had 4 excellent supervisors ,except the company hired a total idiot supervisor that harassed me so badly .I couldn""t work there anymore"
good,"they know how to make sales happen"
good,I really like working for Home Depot.  I like the people I work with and I like my managers.  I was very surprised by the quality of the training.  They sent me to Atlanta to learn 20/20.  I had been using 20/20 for ten years previously and I learned something new each day I was there.
good,Had an amazing opprotunity to learn new things as everyday provides something new. Fortunately there are a handful of great people working there with a vast knowledge of the store and its products.
good,Normal job but worked hard for little money.  Hours where normal as other retailers.  Management was available for questions and help when needed.  Just not enough hours.
good,"I worked as a garden associate for the Home Depot in Marysville, OH. I mostly loaded mulch for cars and trucks but when I was doing that I would be inside helping Costumers. I'd  front face items in the shelves so they would be organized and able for the Costumers to easily find. The work was good Alittle slow but well. Management was good at first I was working all kinds of hours but that quickly change cause business slowed so I was eventually only work 12 to 14 hours a week."
good,Great place to work if you like part time hours are good people are nice money could be alittle better...if you work hard they will love you to death.I personally love working there is am certified in 4 different folk lifts my favorite is the order picker where it takes you up high to put heavy stuff in the over head...not many people like it or can drive it like I can...
good,Taking care of customers and meeting their needs.  Inventory tasks on a daily basis...covering in different departments...busy phones and cashiering when needed.
good,A great place to work and meet different types of people. You can not judge a person by their looks. The management team is great and I get alone with all of my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is dealing with rude people. I love when I can make a person smile by helping them find what they are looking for.
good,"Fantastic part-time job I held while attending college for 3 years. Flexible hours, great coworkers and never a boring day."
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for. The only thing is that they need to keep employees at the hours they are hired for, example hired for 29 hours weekly than that is what the employee should be scheduled for not 15-20hrs weekly"
good,i enjoy the people i work with and the customers i serve. i plan my day and set my own goals. Management is helpful and encouraging. Associates cooperate for the good of the store and company.
good,Being a cashier was all about customer service and checking them out with their items in a timely manner. Never had a problem with management or fellow associates. At times the atmosphere had a fun feel to it when not during a busy period. Would recommend them.
good,"time managed, involves some computer skills,knowledge of product and store locations, price changes,cleaning, organizing, preplaning and execution. "
good,I appreciate the extra mile HD goes for development of Associate . joined as Part time associate and grwon to Dept Supervisor
good,"good job with very flexible hours for those in school or with another part time job. Always room for promotion, and can gain experience working with heavy machinery ie. forklift, small loaders, etc."
good,"It's has been a great job, excellent company. I enjoy working for a great company like this one, but its time for career change, my co-workers make it so hard to work at times. the hardest part of the job is working on reset. I really enjoy the set schedule Mon- Friday that helps a lot since I'm a student as well."
good,It was a great place for me with my construction background and enjoyed working with the customers very much helping them with their home projects and guiding them
good,It is a very helpful resource in fulfilling employment for your well being. It has a decent pay. They spoil their employees with fun and food.
good,"Great opportunity to grow with the company, the sky is the limit with how far you can grow in your career. Great Company to be apart. will be around for a long time no worry about to being here"
good,"I liked working here because you got to see different faces every single day and something different was going on every day. It was the ""same"" thing but different experiences every day which was fun."
good,"Home Depot is a nice place to work. The culture of store is sort of like a family and always very welcoming. I love my job there because you get to help people, especially with design questions. I love working in a store that provides everything and anything you would need for a remodel. I can go to paint and pick out wall color, head over to flooring to pick out a new hardwood or backsplash tile, and then go to kitchens to pick out cabinets and countertops."
good,"I would get the lot prepared before the power hours in order to ensure that I was ready to start the day.  Follow up with Management on the Safety Check List to ensure that everything was safe before the start of the day.   When power hours came I would wait totally on customers.  Help them load their cars and help them put a flag on their materials to ensure everything was up to code before departure.  I would say most of the time Management was great but there would be days where I felt bullied completely because our store as a team was not doing enough to make the day.  That was frustrating.  I would say the hardest thing about working the lot is the there are too many bosses wanting different tasks out of you.  There are 4 head cash associates, 1 front end manager as well as a special services manager.  So too many orders being enforced all at once.  I would say the most enjoyable thing about the job was we had alot of lunches which were catered in from management at special times of the year."
good,Work was fast paces and do the job rite or don't do it at all and go home type of places . mostly over all everything ran smooth and business stay good always and was over timer here and there to.
good,I would gladly work at The Home Depot again if there was a position open for me and the pay was higher. I lwft on good terms and promotable.
good,Decent company to work for. Always provide timely breaks every two hours. Company culture is friendly and feels like family.
good,I experienced a lot of hard work in this place .I learned and meet lots of experienced people in my life in this place and by working at HD I learned how to fix things and learned that always there is a way to fix problems.
good,The Home Depot is a great Place to work. I have been an employee for over 20 years and Home Depot is very family orientated.
good,"I was with this company for 2 years and transferred within it. I deigned kitchens and baths. I also helped to organize one of the departments in Texas."
good,Home Depot is a fun place to work.  I really enjoyed my department supervisor.  He was very organized and the tasks that he set up daily made it easy to feel a sense of accomplishment with my job.  It's also exciting that customers work with you to meet their home improvement needs.  Advancement didn't happen quickly enough for me and not having a full time job caused me to leave the company.  The management is very friendly and really tries to promote a culture of helpfulness and friendliness.
good,Was a good place to work but managers did not understand the family concept. Hard to get training needed when supervisors are to busy.
good,"This is the best part-time job and it offers endless opportunities (i.e. flexible hours, vision and dental benefits, 401K and room for growth)."
good,"Home depot was awesome and taught me many new skills, would recommend this job to anybody, especially if you are DIY and like to learn new things"
good,Has been too many years since I have worked there to give an accurate picture of what the work environment is currently like. This is mostly a specialty retail environment. IE. home improvement. Customer's come because they are entering a home improvement project or are a Contractor looking for materials to complete a job. You should have knowledge in the department you are working in to secure a position. Computer based learning is important to being successful in any position that you hold. Company benefits are among the best offered in any retail establishment.
good,There are a lot of reasons to work for the Home Depot.  They are a family oriented company and the people genuinely care for you.  A typical day at work for me is pretty laid back.  I assist guests with purchases and have had help with the learning process of the store's computers systems.
good,"I have 190 employees that I have to manage on a regular bases. I have to manage payroll, controllable markdowns, P&L, Sales and just day to day tasking."

good,"Home Depot over all is a very good company to work for.  But it is going to very from store to store.  Over the past few years Silverdale has declined.  It could be a good store again, it needs a better manager then who is in there right now.  (10-30-2015)  With a better manager that sees the big picture of there actions, it could be a great place to work again.  I think that in some aspects it has gotten to corporate and needs to get back to the associates."
good,"Loved the fact that 90% of my job descriptions was to make customers happy by helping them get what they needed."

good,Always a joy to work with the employees and customers.  To learn about the different departments and what project each customer is working on. Management keeps us informed of our goal and where we are in achieving that goal.  Helping the employees with personal issues in scheduling or customers with what they are looking for is always a feel good.  Being a big company they are good about keeping all stores on the same page.
good,Home Depot Store Support Center was a great place to work. We were able to work in a professional atmosphere.

good,Home Depot is a great company to work for.  They take excellent care of associates.  But at store levels are not always the same as corporate.
good,"I really enjoy working at The Home Depot. The hours are tough at first, but once you get used to them they're great. I love what I do while servicing the bays and helping customers is pretty great too. I like seeing what new products are coming out and learning how to do things and become a better DIYer. The co-workers are good for the most part, but some of them can be pretty difficult to work with. My immediate supervisor is great, but his boss has been a big let down. I have talked to him several times about moving to full time, but he keeps putting it off until he can say no."
good,"Great place to work!"
good,"I loved the fact that we talked to alot of people, helping them or show we we can find the items.We ewre a great team and evolving together, was very fun, always boosting eachother up when we find a unsastified costumer. Great job."
good,"I am a cashier, where I conduct sales and returns. I have learned about many projects by interacting with customers. I have also been able to give advice to customers about projects that I have completed. My co-workers are instrumental to my success because we work as a team.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with irate customers, however I find many ways to assure the customer leaves totally satisfied and assure a pleasant shopping experience. I enjoy meeting and working with a diverse group of employee's and customers."

good,"A day at The Home Depot...I walk in making my way to the brake room to clock in, and everyone i work with has a smile on their face and says hello. We are like a family at The Home Depot and we take care of each other. Things I have learned are never take anything to heart, if a customer comes in and yells at me let it roll off my back. don't take it personal. Also, if I don't know something its ok to take the time to figure it out. The hardest part of my job is when we are super busy and low staffed. It get difficult when i'm on the phone with a customer, have two other people on hold while three are looking at me in person waiting for help. If i just breath and do all that I can then I know I will get through it."
good,While at work I get the opportunity to work with a variety of different customers.  I work with a great team of people in my section that make the work day more enjoyable.
good,Working for Home Depot I had a chance to meet and greet a lot of different people. Being a cashier I was first and last person that a customer seen. Being able to tend to or help a customer in need was a big part of our day right along with ringing out their orders. I really enjoyed working with Home Depot but I needed a full time job and at that time a full time position wasn't available.
good,"Day after day, I work at Home Depot. I’ve worked at Home Depot for 6 months. My position there is a cashier. A few months have gone by and all I do is show up and do my job as a cashier. The cashiers have someone who runs the front end along with every register in the store, and that person is a head ashier. After what I see the head cashiers go through, I would never want to be a head cashier for the rest of my life."
good,"During the time of employment at this job a typical day would consist of to much disorder between supervisors, and there was no equal opportunity for workers to advance in higher positions. The co workers were polite and I didn't think this job had any difficulties to me."
good,"The Home Depot recognizes cultural differences, respects and promotes it as one of the companies cultures. The management celebrates even international cultural feasts. The company has an excellent team spirit, great team play amongst co-workers both at the job and even out of the job; it is like another home, it is family. The hardest part of the job was having to stand up through the entire shift (as it comes with the job) however, I adapted to it and so it stopped being a problem. The most enjoyable part of the job was customer service; that is having to interact with people of different backgrounds and cultures, different beliefs ,in fact diversity amongst the people I served was to me the beauty of the job. Having to connect with people you have never known by listening to them, determining their needs and satisfying these needs was fulfilling."
good,"I was a cashier, I liked my job even though it was a holiday job"
good,Enjoyed my time there made great friend and learned my art in sales.

good,"learned a lot of new things I like learning as I go keeps me challenged , learned all kinds of things its on the resame and working with people is easy, hardest part of a job is when your working with customers and they are yelling at you or your co-worker but you learn fast that its nothing in the end most enjoyable would be making people laugh and customers because at some point when you get to people its like a family"

good,Day start off by reporting to your manager to get assigned duties for that day. Once assigned your off. The associates are all helpful and on the same page so it makes it easier to stay focused. Best part of the job are the many incentives they offer such as bonuses and product raffles from the stores.
good,My time spent there was great the people and atmosphere were warl and welcoming.

The hardest part of the job is standing in one spot all day. the most enjoyable part is seeing the smile on a happy cusotmer's face.

good,"Love woking here, the team members are great, the management is funny and very kind."
good,I typical day at work would be where management micro manages you. You are not trusted to do the job in which you were hired to do.  On the other hand the co-workers are a great group of people to be around.  They are family oriented and support each other.  The hardest part of this job is having a manager team that doesn't want you to have a voice of your own. Some managers just want you to follow what they say do no questions asked.
good,"Good company to work for but very rare chances of advancement. I was awarded employee of the month 3 times in a row and was refused a $0.55 raise. The work environment was great, nice people and very friendly which was enjoyable, and I enjoyed loading customers cars it was a job where you know you've worked a long day when you finally take a seat on the couch. great company, management at the Reston branch needs work though."

good,This was just a co-op opportunity I under took while in high school.

good,Staff is very helpful. Very family-oriented company willing to help their customers.
good,"I loved working for The Home Depot. Working Nights and getting 40hrs a week was a major plus. I enjoyed my Bosses, my Crew and the job all the way around. I would highly recommend working here, but you will have to work for your money, it's a very physical job with a lot of lifting and moving of things 8hrs a day 5 days a week."
good,"I worked as a lot associate pretty much Brings carts in to the store, pick up garbage and empty the trash cans, and help customers load their vehicles."
good,"I learned how to make keys, cut blinds,made a lot of good friends. The hardest part was trying to get a fulltime position."

good,"I loved working here. The pace was always fast, great people and managers thats help keep the environment positive and smart thinkers for saftey."
good,"Great Company"
good,"Its a call center there is no room for advancement like they promise the hours you are promised are not given the pay is okay not the best, but its easy work something anyone could do just boring, the people you work will are great to be around and are willing to help"
good,Co-workers are easy to get along with and have a lot of fun making time go by and helping customers. Typical day is pulling orders and getting them ready to be picked up or shipped out rather if its the same day or not.

good,answering the call as a THD rep. great management and overall good work place relations
good,"Home Depot was the kind of workplace where I would have wanted to grow not only professionally but intellectually, where my own ideas are received as well as innovative ideas and knowledge acquired in the past. Where my knowledge and work is appreciated in terms of having an economic stability and security within the organization.  However, the growth opportunities are not available and can be unfair.  I did meet lots of friends, and my coworkers and I were a team."
good,"A typical day would include opening or closing the store, counting the safe, helping customers in my specialty departments, being the manager on duty, assisting customers, and most of all being there for my team mates and associates. I learned so many things about tools, painting, electrical, gardening, appliances, mill work, flooring, and hardware in general. The management team is very supportive but the opportunity for advancement never seems to be there. My team was very supportive and more like a family. We would always be there for each other and the customers. The hardest part of the job was not being able to move up in the company even though you put in the hard work and time. The things I loved the most about the job was the customers and never knowing what the day would bring. The job was always full of excitement."
good,"Work is ever changing and fluid. Demanding, in a fun and exciting way. No two days are ever alike."
good,"an excellent place to work, involved in community projects helping veterans"

good,This job was based on the soccer games and who played that day. I liked it because I got to meet people.
good,My days were always different.  I loved the challenges that came daily. I loved customer service and helping others.
good,A typical day at work is meeting the different personalities and putting a smile on your face to make other people feel good about their shopping experience at Home Depot.  In the hours of a day experiencing and learning different tasks and making every hour count.  Working as a team player and always being available to face any challenge.  Getting along with your co-workers and management team and being a part of the team.
good,"I like the company , but the management team belittles co workers under them,. make them feel worthless."
good,"Its a very fast pace job always maintain busy. I've learned a lot about our store as well as giving great customer service, customers always comes first that's the value while we take care of our customers. The management is ok as well as organization. Co-workers are very friendly good people to work with. Hard part is standing for a long period of time.Most enjoyable part is to see that the customers always find what they need and leaving satisfied."
good,"It was a good place to learn how to be independant and self sufficiant."
good,I worked in the electrical department and was able to share my knowledge of the electrical trade with my customers. I was able to build relationships with customers who would come and ask advice on projects at home. They would come in and ask instruction or trouble shooting questions which motivated me to stay on top of my game in order to be able to better serve them. I prided myself on my customer relations. Having never worked in a customer service environment what I learned from this is simply treat others as you would like to be treated.  In regards to my coworkers I thought it was a fun place to work. I enjoyed every aspect of the job. there was no hardest part.
good,I loved working at The Home Depot.  I hated leaving.  The pay was never good and benefits are pricey.  Management were great and co-workers were even better.
good,  My typical day would consist of helping customers in various activities from locating items to making special orders to making phone sells. My co-workers are great they are all there to help one another and keep a friendly work environment. My management team is awesome always  rewarding and giving positive feedback letting you know what they liked or how you can do better.  Overall this is a good company to work for.
good,I really enjoy working for Home Depot but the are no health benefits and it is not full time
good,Helping customers is number one job piority. I learned customer service and how to operate multiple forklifts/trucks. Management can be demanding but retail usually is. All co-workers are nice. Managing worklists and customers can be slightly difficult. The fast pace and consistent work is great.
good,"-Assist customers with the loading of their vehicles "
good,"The company is strong, but the ever changing climate of associates and management makes it difficult to adjust from a private company.  A typical day at work for a kitchen designer is unstructured and relies heavily upon customer relations.  It can be rather stressful, but that's part and parcel of managing such a large project.  It's performing the other tasks required of a retail work environment that makes the job different than a typical cabinetry designer.  Corporate encourages certification and education, and helps in many ways to ensure we have the knowledge we need for all related systems.  Co-workers usually do not understand the job, but over time come to respect the position because of the amount of detail we have to maintain.  The hardest part of the job is the unruly, unpredictable schedule.  This is retail and the schedule is all over the place.  The most enjoyable part is seeing a project come to fruition after months of hard work.  I've probably designed hundreds of kitchens and rarely get to see one in the completion stage, so when I do, it's a great feeling."
good,Management complimented me upon completing large projects. Very flexible scheduling.
good,"Relaxed environment"
good,Everyday ther was always something new to learn. The other associates made working there very pleasurable.

good,"Daily responsibilities included preparing shipping documentation for outbound loads, filing and documenting my daily responsibilites."
good,Just never had a set schedule due to management communications with supervisors.
good,"Home Depot is definitely a place for anyone who's looking forward to learn and grow with, the don't offer any job security or work life balance, but they will give equal opportunities to their employees."
good,A typical day at work for me is to update the daily price changes/ads; walk my aisles to make sure my labels are legible; assist customers with location of itema; ring on register if necessary and continue my day to day operations.
good,A typical day for a cashier at Home Depot is caring for customers in a fast and friendly manner. Working along with co workers to ensure customers leave with all they may need for the project at hand. Hardest part of my jobs is the time in between customers. The most enjoyable of my job is the over all friendly atmosphere we maintain.
good,"This job was repetitive every day. A typical day was standing the whole shift, sorting, pulling and stacking parts. I learned how to operate a press machine. Management was firm and fair with everyone. There was nothing hard about this job and I really didn't have any co-workers. I wasn't there long enough to establish this sort of contact with any one person."
good,"Great place to work, just time for a change. I lve my co-workers and my supervisor, I just dont see myself advancing here."
good,a typical day at work was cutting wood in the lumber department hi/low operator

good,"Everyday is a new day, always something different to learn."
good,"Home Depot had very experience people from the trades but did not want to pay for our experience as well as our knowledge,being hired we were told our pay would go up considerably which never did we as former Contractors helped and sold the right products to our customers"
good,"Great company. Amazing leadership team, Benefits are great and pay is one of the best for customer service field."
good,"Management is not consistent throughout all stores. Focus is different wherever you work. Store environments closely reflect the management team. Great company and moving to be the best, putting big focus on taking care of the customers."
good,"I worked as a Human Resources Staffig Analyst in the HR department interviewing individuals who applied for various positions located within The Home Depot's retail stores. I worked an 8 hr day, Tue-Sat form 9-6. The atmosphere was laid back, but everyone worked hard."
good,Make sure prics and product are presented up-to-date with company standards and maximal profit is optimized.
good,Kitchen design was a great job! This is what i went to school for. I love to design and help others with their dreams become realities.
good,"My typical day at work includes constant contact with qualified applicants via very busy phone line. Recruit and interview candidates for part time, temporary and full time positions for over 2000 Home Depot Stores, Distibution Centers and Repair and Liquidation Centers across the U.S. Main Liason with all stores, District Managers and Merchandising Team. I work with 6 different databases to ensure our applicants get top notch service and get the best interview based on their skill set. Home Depot is constantly changing, so there is something new with our databases that we use daily. My co-workers respect and value my knowlwdge so they are constantly asking for advice or knowledge on different processes. The hardest part of my job is staying on phones 90% of the day reading from a script that I memorize and a week or two later it changes. The most enjoyable part of my job is employing someone who has had a tough time during the changes of companies downsizing due to economic changes."
good,"answered calls and emails,scheduled all incoming lumber trucks for delivery,my co-workers were very reliable and hard workers,the hardest part of the job was having to leave after my time was up,the most enjoyable part of the job was working in a fast paced enviornment."

I read communications book, to see what needs to be completed. Complete pack-downs and make showroom ready for opening. The most enjoyable part of my day is seeing and talking with customers."
good,Answer phone calls from customers with general questions about merchandise and pricing.
good,"Making customers your number priority, to give them everything the need by selling them the whole project at hand. With these things together, home depot will soon be the number one retailer in the world."
good,Each work day varies learn alot about different chemical you learn how to tell the difference between products everyday you get a truck full of different product
good,Work with customers as a sales associate and follow up on what ever they need. When time permitted down load stock and straigthen material so it would be presentable to customers.
good,This was a very fun job. However if you are looking for a full time job I think it would be best if you do not have a family to go home to every night. The hours are sometimes long and you will never get weekends off so it is hard to plan vacations and such. The pay is average and the people at the store were often very nice.
good,I loved the overall flow of home depot. The people are great the pay is fair and the movement is quick.
good,"Home Depot is a good place to start a carrer it you like that kind of business. They promote based on merits, the pay is decent, they company promotes comunity activness and involvment. One thing they seem to be very proud of is how many Olympic hopefulls they employ. The OJT is thorough and if you already know alot about any given field they give you the option to test out of the training as applicable."

The people behind that desk are the nicest people I have ever worked with and the people in that entire store are so nice and respectful.   I made some life-long friends and will miss them very much.  The only reason I left is that I chose to go back to Richmond to finish school.  I tried to get the same job out in Richmond, but unfortunately the position was not available. I miss it!  Home Depot people are awesome!"

good,"The job was basic stocking and cleanup. They trained me on the reach and forklift, worked with my schedule when I needed it to change due to life events. Overall it was a good job for what it was,  the staff were extremely supportive and easy to work with. The only complaint was that they cut overtime when minimum wage increased and made it difficult to live off of."
good,"Even though the pay scale was on the low side, my experience there was awesome. They make you feel like family in a way. They have many incentive based work plans and management was pretty good, for the most part"

good,I enjoy working here. learning a lot. Giving the best of my capabilities to achieve success.Amazing coworkers. Amazing company. Would recommend to friends and family.
good,I enjoyed working here. They had Great paid hours at the time. Management was pretty straight forward. They offered plenty of hours and overtime. Also the two cafeterias were awesome with great food. I enjoyed that the most. There was anything hard about the job.
good,"the overnight working shift at Home Depot was a hard working job, with lots of encouragement on fast pace, however with a lack of incentive in doing so. The workplace environment was fast paced but the general culture of the workers was relaxed and helpful."
good,"I enjoyed and loved my job at the Home Depot creating employees schedules helping with work shops, & hiring process, orientation, very high paced environment, was a hard to struggle with work and family time which I’m sure for everyone and running people slim out on sales floor was very stressful."
good,"Working at The Home Depot part-time has been a learning experience for me. Within the few months that I have worked there, I have developed sharp verbal and written communication skills, amongst other skills."
good,"The department was understaffed but the workload was not over bearing.  Majority of supervisors knew what they were doing, and operated their departments well.  Others not so much, which made some days difficult.  Great company culture."
good,I've been with home depot for a little over 4 years. It's a really good place to work at and the people are amazing here. You learn a lot about working with the system they have and it helps  when you are faced with certain problems.
good,great company for me as a part timer if I was physical ly able I would be fulltime   Management is  more than fair ahd my team of MET are the best people  Ihave ever worked with The rest of the store are good people.
good,"In my opinion working for The Home Depot for 6 months it is a fun industry to be involved in and every store is a little bit different based on the storr location, neighborhoods and local contractors in that area."
good,"I was a hard worker but was tired at times werei fell asleep and didnt return back to wrk wen i was supposed to "
good,"I like working with people and solving problems. I like doing demonstrations, putting a toilet together, putting a sink together. Its easy putting together irrigation problems."
good,"The customers aren’t bad at all, as opposed to other retail stores. Most are patient regulars, or curious DIYers. There is definite room to move up too if you show initiative. Be prepared to lift 20-40 lbs though, even if you are a cashier. Loaders are often busy but people will help and you call for them."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Home Depot, management was excellent co-workers really easy to work with also enjoyed their jobs and it showed in their work habits, unfortunately I got sick with swine flu and missed the amount of days that are required"
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work and they are understanding about financial situations and personal problems you may have. I feel safe working at Home Depot, since everyone there mostly feels like a family, everyone gets along, excluding about 1/5 of the managers. Management does need to be changed though, some managers will scream at you for extremely small things and several employees could confirm this if asked. Unfortunately Home Depot is very into seniority, sometimes by how long you've been there and other times just because of actual age instead of how long you've been there, it just depends on the manager that is handling the situation. I would also stress that many people that work at Home Depot will get offended by literally anything and if that 1/5 of the managers is the one to handle it then good luck, it literally broke me mentally after it happened to me, its common unfortunately with certain managers. The main reason for people quitting Home Depot is simply because of the managers that are a problem and that have no people skills at all and don't seem to understand the idea of employees actually being humans. However that other 4/5 is the most dedicated phenomenal team of managers I think I've ever seen in any workplace including those I haven't worked at its easy to tell they put their heart into the company, but I did have to tell those who want to apply that not all managers there are as amazing as the others and you'll learn the first week which managers are the problem managers, you'll hear their yelling at least 3-5 times a week from the middle or"
good,The managers are amazing The GM and other managers always had water for us and randomly food. I would recommend this place for anyone who can handle the retail world.
good,"Working there was cool, but the management team sucked, they're super rude and favoritism is definitely in their nature. They promise you career advancement but if you're not one of their favorites, you will be overlooked."
good,"For what it is it has a good pay. Nothing special about it realy. You do get good health related benefits. I mostly just worked there for the pay, thay start off at a pretty good rate."
good,The associates that been there more than 15 to 18 years will nit pick at you accuse you of putting stuff in wrong places make you feel like your over stepping. Make you feel unwelcome
good,Like it there .. everyone had been very nice.  Good training program along with a great orientation... great benefits ... great offer for education reimbursement .. employee discounts on plenty of outside companies etc .....
good,When I used to work there at home depot my first five years were fun for me.But then a new assistant Manager came and they started firing people for no reason.And they were good workers too.then after thirteen years I quit making 18 dollars an hour which I still miss.I tried to go back but then they only wanted to pay me 11 dollars.
good,"Mucha organizacion laboral, aprendizaje constante en productos y habilidades con los clientes."
good,This a great company. I have seen many people come and go. I work in the corporate office where there is  alot of advancment. This location  also has a Starbucks and a CVS.
good,Love dealing with the customers and being able to help with their needs. Also loved the associated and working in a environment were I felt like a second family
good,"I have enjoyed working at Home Depot both as a cashier and now as Bookkeeper. My associates are great to work with, many really hard working people. And I also enjoyed meeting and getting to know many of our long time customers."
good,Great environment to work. Managers listen and o associates and when needed always there. Never a dull moment with them. Supervisors always willing to help out. Enjoyed our morning workouts. It was a great way to wake us up and get us to stretch our muscles before working. Loved working there.
good,The management team is amazing and they know all employees by name and it feels great especially if you are part time. The hours are flexible and they only schedule you when you are open.
good,"It’s a great company but I am looking for more pay as I have a child and can’t afford to keep working there, managers are great normally and it has a very relaxed atmosphere"
good,"Great place, great people. Great staff pay above minimum wage. Seasonal positions. Very well organized and up to date technology to make job easier.  Supportive management"
good,they become your work family and are very supportive of one another. it was a great learning experience. they work very well with your schedule. they are willing to teach you the correct processes and procedures for your job
good,Really enjoyed working here. It was a great place to work the people were amazing. Just wish there was more consistence in the schedule and more opportunity for advancement.
good,Generally work harder then what the pay is worth especially if you can drive the forklifts. Coworkers generally take advantage of the policy’s and break times making things very hard to get done.
good,Its very dynamic culture. Management strategy towards employee retention should be focussed on. Many high quality associates have left the organization leaving huge gap and effort to get similar resources.
good,"while working in Home Depot you can learn almost everything if you like to learn stuff for fixing all the things around your house/apartment etc. like plumbing, flooring, gardening and much more"
good,"Very slow paced. Fun to work but not so fun that you'd rather be there than somewhere else. Hours are not guaranteed unless you are full time, so they are hard to grab in the winter."
good,The only way they’ll keep their employees would be if upper management all got on the same page and didn’t make it a contest of who has the most authority. It shows lack of professionalism and leaves employees to perform poorly or not want to be there at all. Other than that it’s a great company to work for.
good,"Home depot is a pretty good place to work, even though youre not going there to learn you always do. Working there helped me learn to deal with people."
good,"It was okay, I don’t have much to say about it. I didn’t really enjoy my time there. I wanted more. I wanted to be happy where I was at and I wasn’t. I wasn’t being challenged or whatever, it just wasn’t an environment I wanted to be around. But that’s my personal opinion, there are those who feel otherwise."
good,"Job duties included making customers the first priority and offering assistance in helping them find everything they need along with selling needed accessories. Other duties include cleaning and keeping my department grand opening ready and fully stocked at all times. Keeping the department safety compliant was also a key duty of mine. I have worked in the garden, hardware, building materials, and lumber departments."
good,Working with a great group of people in office and speaking to people across the United States is always interesting.  Lunches and different in house fund raisers to benefit Home Depot employees
good,for certain people you get a job with the Home depot with limited training and a lot of standards that are not really told to you but you are held accountable to those standards with some Nepotism when it comes to believing another persons positional status over yours if you complain your discipline for it and than held accountable to the coaching standards that may or may not be realistic as a means to prove your inadequacy on job performance but if your like you don't have to worry about this and everyone looks the other way
good,"Its hard work, and fast paced.  That hard work goes mostly underappreciated however.  The promote from with the building/company often but not always the best candidate gets the position with those associates being let go or quitting shortly after.  Its a great company and culture to be a part of but very stressful at times."
good,"Working at Home Depot was a great experience.  I had to quit for school but if I didnt find better opportunity I would go back. "
good,"Good company with job security. But advancement is very bleak. People get promoted on the basis of management's favourites, race, etc but hardly based upon the hardwork, talent, experience, knowledge."
good,"Loved working at Home Depot. As with allof jobs there are all sorts of coworkers. Some hide from customers or tell them they can't answer a question so they don't have to help. Most of my co-workers were friendly and dedicated and went over and above to help with excellent customer service."
good,Depends on your position in the company but they take care of their on . Wonderful first job for kids and great part-time schedule for vets or single parents .
good,It is a great place to work and I learned a lot during my time there. Home Depot has many different computer classes that you can/ or need to take for the different departments. The classes are easy to do.  I like their Customer First attitude and the management at my store was great.
good,It's oppressive in the sense they make you push the store credit card and berate you for not getting more people to apply. Good people work there with a sense of store superiority.
good,work with some of the best people at home depot for now 5 years . a lot of workers stay at the home depot flexible  work schedules make for a fun environment
good,"I loved working with the fast pace and dealing with my customers on a daily basis, I had repeat customers on the daily. At Home Depot, we constantly had monthly training, which taught me many skill for each department, from Job skills to Safety.  There was really no hard part to my job, because I loved it and the way the employees were treated to rewards.  The Only downside, was all the work that I put in and rewards I would receive, I was overlooked for Full time and I patiently waited for it, but every company has their favorites."
good,Sometimes it seems as if corporate pulls numbers out of their behind if they think that we're gonna get the truck offloaded and put away all in the same night
good,i made sure the parking lot was clean i helped customers and loaded cars the management was very open and friendly most enjoyable part was dealing with the customers
good,"Worked 6 days a week, 10-12 hours per day, over 100 miles driven per day with average 3 appointments per day, Trained on the Ipad, for sales force, how to measure with measure apps, design and promote ideals for home remodeling , promoted specials on items of the week, assist customers for Home Depot financing programs, interface with upper management on customer concerns, Nice place to work with great employees, Hardest part of job is working with install teams, that had no concern for the sales people or the customers understanding of the install process, lack of follow ups from installs, getting customer final inspection, certifications, filing final paper work with local authorizes. When things go smooth in a timely manner and see customers happy and proud faces, knowing they made the right choice for the remodeling needs."
good,"it was a good place to work, but it was very slow and not enough hours , people there are friendly and they always do the best parties and the management always ALWAYS put u first and love to do fun things with the workers"
good,"good place to work, great opportunity to move up. Stay positive, motivated and focus. Stay away from bad talk about anyone. Build healthy relationships and network,"
good,Overall a great place to work. Highly competitive workplace environment. Operational hours very widespread for anyone looking for specific work hours.
good,"When I walk into the breakroom, it doesnt always feel like a break room. It feels like a nice hangout spot for all of the employees. Its comfortable, It's great!"
good,"Any given day at work includes engaging with associates, scheduling and payroll. I learned hoe to manage my time and tasking while managing over 300 associates.  The culture is about taking care of the customers and the associates. The hardest part of the job is the continuous change in leadership. The most enjoy part of the job is the associates."
good,"Fun Fridays, Christmas Party, profit sharing"
good,Working at home depot is fun full of oppertunties to learn new things fair easy going place great people management can sometimes be a little rocky but great place to work
good,Very good team and working culture. Very busy work environment helping with different departments including translating in Spanish. Very unpredictable work schedule that may change as early as 24 hrs.
good,"The Home Depot family is a close one with many perks and benefits. However, workdays can be difficult, especially in the summer. I clocked out of my shift pretty gross most days as I worked specifically in the Garden Center."
good,"This is a retail job in a busy environment. You will never be bored here, but you will also never be able to be lazy. Good management makes this place have a good culture. The downside is low pay."
good,"daily runs for appointments"
good,"Fun to work with a lot of people you will encounter every day, you will learned different things about home improvements and how to use equipment and also knows familiarization of product you sell."
good,Somewhat relaxed when you work.  The main stress part is calling for tills and loading because it will take a very long time but the people you get to talk to make it great.  The advancements will not even get to interview you for at least 4 months after application though
good,the home deepot is a okay to work at but it has alot of people that are rude anmd treat u bad u just have to deal with it  i mean wehat else can u do am i right lol
good,"it s agood time, enjoyed it there working. it is very flexible and usually easy and some funs. but paying low the time i was there -- now it might be increased as the minimum wages enforced by law"
good,The Home Depot is a good company to work for but the varies from store to store. Having worked in 2 stores in and 1 store in the south the management style is completely different.
good,"Great place to work. Employees are wonderful. Management changes a lot with assistant managers. They do this so the assistant's can be more well rounded and better prepared for advancement. Store managers in my store typically stay 1-3 years before moving to a higher volume store. The company as a whole is great at giving back to the communities they are in. They also have a lot of programs in place for the associates to continue their education, grow in different departments and roles within the store, and provide assistance with associates that need temporary assistance financially, with childcare, etc. They offer maternity leave, 401K, stock options, etc. "
good,Been here for about 6 months and I love it. My Coworkers are so great and the Managers are amazing! I would love to stay at this job for the remainder of the time it takes me to start my career.
good,"great company to work for overall,fair to their employees Home depot is an equal opportunity provider and takes really great care of their employees needs and concerns"
good,"I worked at The Home Depot full-time "
good,"Busy, fast paced, learned everything from tools, hardware, lumber types and their uses, plumbing, flooring. Hardest part of the job was the manual labor. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to connect with the customers from start to finish on their projects."
good,I enjoyed my time working at the home depot because I was constantly thriving to help customers.  I did all the research at the special order desk for our customers and was able to find exactly what they were looking for.
good,Weekends were busy but what warehouse isn’t so just try to keep calm you will have bad customers but that’s everywhere don’t let that get to you. Some don’t be late they don’t tolerate that.
good,"I was a seasonal cashier, I mostly worked in the garden department and watered the flowers in my spare time. It was a pretty great job. Would definitely recommend."
good,"A productive and fun place to work with lots of growth career to acheive.and lot to learn,always updated with training and with new products."
good,"The Home Depot is a good company to work for, the workplace culture was great, most everyone got along with zero drama on the night shift. The job itself wasn't hard, it was a lot of the same thing over and over again so it quickly gets repetitive. Once you learned where everything in the store goes there really isn't that much else to learn except how to operate the machines. The management was fantastic, they were true leaders who lead from the front and were great to work with. A typical day is I would come in at around 6:30 or 7 that evening, spend about an hour unloading a truck and staging carts, take a break, then put the freight away on shelves, taking breaks every hour or so."
good,I have worked for this company for 10 years now and it is still a great place to work. It is a friendly work environment and customer service is a priority at all times.
good,Great place to help customers finish their projects and same a lot of money.  The people I worked with as well as the management made a great work environment.
good,Customer service is the best part of the company. Helping customers finding parts that there looking for there project or re doing a bathroom or kitchen. Selling the customer all that applies with the needs. Also I was a floater was able to move to different departments to learn as much as could through the Home Depot.
good,"Could have better sense of their own systems, however great place to work for."
good,I have enjoyed working for Home Depot. I am only looking for new employment because my family is relocating to Humboldt County because my wife was accepted into a 2 yr RN program.
good,"Home Depot is a great work enviroment with fun people to work with, and awesome customers. Most day's keep you busy so time flies by. It is decent pay for the job you do."
good,"Hours are flexible but sometimes, if you work part time, there are not enough hours of work (doesn't make any sense). Scheduling might be an issue if associates call out but overall just focus on whatever task you have to do and time well naturally go by..."
good,"If you work more than 25 hours a week they cut your time, have schedule 3 weeks, Very fast pace, no company discounts but offer travel/car rental discounts if you can plan in advance"
good,"Loved the job, people at the store are the best.  Down to earth and willing to help other employees.  Very friendly.  The hardest part about the job, is as a cashier, you are expected to stand all day on hard cement."
good,"Very professional company with excellent management. Organized workplace with adequate training. My shift could be opening one day, mid day the next and closing the next. Somewhat hard on home life."
good,Home Depot is an excellent company with excellent values and very family oriented. Sometimes the job can be very stressful because of lack of appropriate staffing and associates become very overwhelmed by what is expected of them. Management is great and they always work with associates on family needs. I highly recommend this company for part time work
good,Greeting the customers everyday made my day knowing I helped someone find something to make thier day complete is a joy to me Customers first. Being a cashier here was also excellent experience reallt good company to work for
good,Some days are busy and fast paced while other days are slow. You are able to work in different areas of the store as far as being a cashier. Overall it is a good job.
good,"pretty relaxed atmosphere, too many bosses.  One manager will tell you one thing then there would be another one right behind you telling you another thing."
good,"My time here at Home Depot is going well. This is a big company that has many opportunities  to advance in. I can change departments at any time (after being there for 6 months) and change again if I want too. The hours are okay, but my coworkers are great. Home Depot is a great company to work for."
good,There is a lot of room for growth within the company although honestly depends on the location you work at unfortunately. But given the right store with the right management team and a motivated person that likes to work as part of a team someone that’s determined for success then it could be a great career path.
good,"Family orientated, friendly, goal related, fun until new management started segregating associates, needed better training to advance into different positions"
good,"Home Depot is a company that believes in promoting from within and allows for movement to different departments, giving opportunity to learn as much as one would want. There are travel opportunities as well to go help other locations when needed."
good,"the hardest part of my job at home depot was when i had to deal with our manager walked out on us, the co-workers walked around pretend she was the boss, stressing everyone out. my most enjoyable part of my job at home depot is when every one put money together to give to me every Friday to cooked for everyone. now that's fun. i enjoy doing that. and how we all put our head together to get the job done all the time. we help and support one another."
good,I enjoy working with associates and customers. Just trying to advance in the company was hard. Just having to interview every time for a position to advance. The company works with you and your schedule.
good,"Fun place to work. Good hours, okay pay. Good people to work around. Great for advancement. Fast paced enviroment. Lots of employee apprectiation done."
good,"A great place with a lax atmosphere. Fellow co-workers were great , helpful . Not a stressful job especially if you do not like interacting with crazy customers ."
good,"Lots of opportunities to grow if have the thrill and desire to excel. "
good,Great company to work for. Every day was a new day with new issues and problems to resolve. Unfortunately the pay was not able to pay the bills after the loss of my husband.
good,"I really enjoy working for Home Depots company, it is a very well paced environment and great people to work with. I. Would recommend working here if your looking to move upon a company."
good,I really enjoyed working here. I wish I did not have to leave due to college. It's face paced and the people I worked with were wonderful and always willing to help you. I worked with a lot of different departments and got to know a lot of wonderful people.
good,"A typical day at work includes greeting customers friendly with a smile, ringing up customers, pulling orders, answering a multi-line phone, assisting customers in a professional manner with product pricing and where to find products, keeping your work location clean at all times, renting trucks and carpet cleaners, pushing returns to their departments, phone sales, will call orders, and occasionall learning a new department.  I have learned quite 3 new jobs a here..  Management is okay.  The workplace culture is versatile and open to all cultures.  The hardest part of the job is standing on the concrete floors constantly.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me is when I learn something new. That always excites me."
good,It is a great place for a first job. You can move as high as you want to go. Fast pasted and rewording. Lots of benefits. Workers with school schedules.
good,"The Home Depot is great, the people are great, they will work with you on a lot of things. It is a great job for students especially, because management is willing to be extremely flexible. I've been very happy working here."
good,"Home Depot provides an environment with which you have virtually no limits to what you can learn. You learn job-centric skills, and you also learn life skills. You learn how to properly grout a tiling project, but you also learn how to explain directions in different ways. These universal skills you obtain, you take with you."
good,"It really is a great company, I just experienced some poor management. I would say two of them were great managers always saying hello, not instructing from the sidelines but actually showing how they want something to be done, put associates first, etc. It's just that the rest were more in it for the title of being a asst. manager than actually responding to customer complaints, servicing the associates needs, talking down upon untrained associates, etc."
good,"I enjoyed working here, however in the role I was in, there was barely any room to grow, the other designer there who was in my position had an extra 10+ years of experience over me and our boss had no room to grow either. I had to move out in order to move up, but I loved the atmosphere. I would go back for the right price."
good,"I worked at Home Depot while attending college, and I thought it was a very well run establishment. There seems to be a good corporate culture that values associates."
good,There is always some work to be done but the managers do not promote the workers they take advantage of them. There are not enough employees on duty to accomplish the work that need to be done. The full-time employee does not help the part time employees.
good,Home Depot is about profit...and employees that do not understand that will not do well. Retail is a very competitive and strange business. It is not for everyone and it took me sometime to get used to it (coming from a manufacturing background).
good,Home Depot went the extra mile to make sure I was properly trained and knew the job before even placing me on the sales floor. Because of this training I will be a customer for life..
good,"A typical day at work I focus on keeping product instock, keeping my four aisles clear from clutter and solving customer  problems.I also help out in the plumbing department, which is a sister department to mine."
good,"I LOVE THE HOME DEPOT! One of the best companies out there to work for.  Great benefits and promotional opportunities.  I love that the company allows us to give back to our communities through the Team Depot and Home Depot Foundation.  However, there are some draw backs to how its managed.  Each store is different and one decision about your job in one store will be different in another."
good,When i worked here i was attending collage and had a few friends i worked with so that made it fun. the manager was tough but fair and they really pushed and enforced teamwork which was refreshing.
good,"As a corporate entity Home Depot is great.  I worked permanent part time and found my schedule to be adequate. "
good,"If you wanted to work a lot of hours, you often could.  Most days are spent stocking shelves or helping customers find what they need.  Company often brings in food or snacks for the associates and the profit sharing was nice."
good,"The garden department was an interesting enjoyable department."
good,"The company overall is awesome to work for, The culture is great. Promotion opportunities are lacking if there is a particular track you want to move. Seems the company org is getting flatter"
good,"Home Depot has developed many programs designed to make all the associates feel the sense of inclusion. Yes, they are long hard retail hours, sometimes hot and sometimes cold. Dusty, noisy and wet. But if you didn't know that headed in to a retail job at a home improvement warehouse then you should have done a bit more homework."
good,"On a typical work day its full adventure, Its usually filled with hours of cleaning of receiving sweeping maintenance.  I have learned how to become patient and keep a cool head in the customer service field. This job definitely helps makes you put your best foot first in customer service, and allows you to provide the best customer service.  My Management are helpful in certain situations, However I always think there is room for growth and development. The hardest part of my job to me would be dealing with individuals whom don't want to do there job in which makes your job that much hard, we all should work as a team to provide excellent customer service."
good,"We work with a 4 weeks schedule, the schedule give us a variety opportunities of  daily work we can work early in the morning as late afternoon."
good,"Overall, I like the concept. But kind of hard to see, the miss management. It could be better. Overall a safe and fun place to work. For part time employee it’s kind of hard. They give unworthy employees full time."
good,"Working in the Lawn and Garden department, we were the group that was responsible for helping customers load their heavy items into their vehicles, as well as getting the carts out of the lot. Being trained on the various fork lifts, it was part of my job to get items for customers from the top shelves such as dry wall, grills, etc. "
good,"My typical day at work is busy carrying out many different tasks, such as unloading material from a delivery truck, stocking shelves when needed, helping customers providing customer service so they can make an informed decision for their purchase, assisting customers loading material in their vehicles, and so on."
good,"Enjoyed working with professionals in the construction industry and dealing with vendors to create a relationship between products and people. Retail is retail and can have its doldrums but as a company, very committed to associates careers and customers being a priority."
good,"relocated from Vancouver to Edmonton for this Opportunity."
good,I loved my team but the management was unusually frustrating and treated anyone that wasn't their favorite poorly. But it was a full time job with great benefits and I think anyone needed that kind of job could definitely find the perfect lace for themselves there
good,Very nice company and people all together. High probability to promote. Good hours and scheduling is not a problem. Anyone looking for a starting job that could become a career should think about the home depot.
good,"work and help customer achieve their project goals."
good,"Hours were great for me at the time, worked from 7-11pm, Monday thru Friday, fast paced, time sensitive. I enjoyed learning to operate some equipment I was previously unfamiliar with, and they were very accommodating with allowing me to work extra hours when I wanted. An overall enjoyable very physical job, with always plenty to do, and all the hours I required."
good,"Great place to work can be a little repetitive or easy to become complacent, Not a lot of opportunity to advance within a store unless someone moves on. great team atmosphere. Only con is working each and every Saturday which is normally a great time for family and the salary. If you don't get what you want initially the increases are marginal at best."
good,it is a nice laid back environment. very family-oriented. I liked that home depot fed you. you could eat comfortably without having to run to the clock from the outside.
good,"HD is a great place, they are friendly and teach you the necessary skills to learn your craft. They setup you up to succeed no what matter where you are placed."
good,It was fun working there. Wish the management in that store was more compassionate towards their employees. Great place to work at and invest in. Always opportunity for advancement.
good,"good management fun work environment, drama free work place which is great. Every one works together to complete the same goal. Overtime is available."
good,Fun place to work with management that was always accessible. There were sometimes were your hands were tied in what you could do for your customer should an issue arise. With creative thinking you should be able to navigate and take care of the customer. There were always days that the store manager would come in and cook for the associates as a show of appreciation and also he was very friendly and open to listening to whatever you had to say. Can not say that about all the managers but the main manager was great.
good,"12 hour shifts \ 3 days a week "
good,"A typical day of work is fun, driving the team, new management, culture driven, training the team is challenging, and hit goal is rewarding! One of the best companies I ever worked for hands down!"
good,The management was great but the pay was absolutely the worst part about the job. The workplace culture was great and everyone went out of their way to help each other out.
good,fun environment with friendly staff members. lots of chances for advances. able to work around school hours. decent management that listens to their associates.
good,There is always something to learn there.  You meet many people from all walks of life and assist with purchases.  The hardest part of the job is putting up the go backs which can be quite heavy at times.
good,This is a good entry level position that could be used as a stepping stone onto something bigger. You get a good foundation with programs that are commonly used for such a position.
good,Home Depot is geared towards a young and college bound type employee.  They offer upward mobility incentive to a freshly graduated from high school or someone who is still in school and trying to expand their horizons.  Naturally a more seasoned employee with already well developed skills does not get the recognition they so deserve to get.  Just an observation.
good,I worked as a Department supervisor in Alaska and loved my job. I left do to low pay and being told advancement in Alaska is based on someone dying or quitting
good,I was only home for the summer from school I wish I could have stayed longer. I enjoyed working with everyone in the building. The store manager congratulated me personally for my grades and making the dean's list.
good,"I enjoyed being apart of the MET Team at Home Depot. It's not the easiest position to get, but if you can follow planograms, maintain bays, and have an attention to detail this job is for you. It starts early in the morning and unless things have changed, you are off by 2:30 in the afternoon. They are apart of corporate so unless things have changed you get weekends off even though you work in a Home Depot Store."
good,very challenging. I built a great team in the tool rental department. Had a lot of support from my peers.  Learned a lot about tools and customer service
good,The management was very professional and accommodating most the time. most matters were handled by the book. i was able to learn quite a bit about almost everything in the store. product knowledge and safety standards were made very clear with various online and physical classes. Lazy people were reprimanded and busy people were recognized. The culture there seems all inclusive. everyone from the cashiers to the management to the cart pushers were included in every aspect.
good,"I like working at The Home Depot because it essentially allows me to have weekends off every week. That helps me a great deal in my personal life. As a part-time worker, I also get some benefits, which do not exist for many part-time employees at other jobs. The wages are fine and competitive for the area and job title and hours. The hardest part of the day is the days that trucks need to be unloaded and placed on shelves, and the easiest part is having hardworking associates joining in to complete team tasks."
good,My time working at home Depot was very worthwhile. I brought in shopping carts from the parking lot and also assisted customers load their newly bought merchandise into their vehicles. It wasn't the most glamorous job but it still gave me a strong work ethic. I would recommend this job to anyone looking for a good entry level position.
good,"The hardest but most challenging part of my day were the 60-75 ""no's"" to one ""yes"". So I developed a thick skin and didn't take rejection as hard as when I did when I first started. I stayed true to myself, and I believed in what I was ""selling"" and I feel as though that is why I was very successful. I learned that I can literally not only perform, but excel in ANY job, after working at Home Depot because, I won't lie, it was tough at times because people can be very rude, but I stayed bubbly and got the job done!"
good,Its depends on the home depot you work. Every home depot as their speciality. The manager need to be fair across the board. Our area manager is a very nice person but doesnt know whats going on among us but the VOA survey can let them know.
good,"Breaks are 20 mins/ Lunch is 30 mins"
good,home depot is a great place to work with plenty of room for advancement.teaches you how to work as a team. i enjoyed coming to every day meeting the venders and all my customers

good,"Request tills from the Vault"
good,"Great company to work for, opportunities for advancement and make more money. Supporting co-workers and management. Company provides essential knowledge training for offered work positions, giving you the best training and skill for success!"
good,Home Depot trains employees well. They must have basic customer service skills as well as knowledge of construction/their specific department. The career advancement was lacking.
good,"Good training, good paid time off and some benefits for even part time employees.  Worked helping employees during holidays, like preparing food for lunch, etc."
good,"Its Home Depot, busy at times, slower at times, but that's when you get caught back up. Days went by fast, from customer to another back to the project you were working on or assisting some one with. It can be a fun place to work with a good leader"
good,"A great place to work for with good benefits. Work 4 days on and off 3. 10 hour shifts. They use of forklifts and Electric pallet jacks,one of the easy work place to work for."
good,"My position was electrical associate, I developed greater customer service skills, the customers loved me. I learned how to cut wire, cut various types of keys. I unloaded the trucks. And increased more knowledgeable awareness as it relates to light bulbs, ceiling fans, solar lights, and generating installation sales for customers."
good,"I enjoyed working with Home Depot, but did not get enough hours.  I typical day at work consisted of returns for people, placing orders and customer resolution."
good,"A typical day at work involved organizing lumber and maintaining a safe and clean work environment.  I learned a lot about different tools and processes while working there including operation of equipment.  "
good,"It was a good place to work, but they lost to many people to change my schedule for personal needs. I need less than 20 hours and I needed days off to work on other thing and wasn't able to get that."
good,Great and unique place to work. Work place is all about customer service and working hard. Vacation hours and sick hours are available. Opportunities for advancement if thats what your goal os.
good,The Home Depot was an okay place to work. Benefits were nice and the coworkers were nice as well. The management was not what is expected or wanted working there. There is one manager there who was so rude and mean to me personally that I would not call him for anything. Besides that I enjoyed working at the Home Depot
good,"A typical day: Arriving at the store at 5:00 a.m. to get the department ready for the day. Bring down stock from the overhead as needed; put away stock that was put away from the night before. Attend store meeting; greet customers. From 9 a.m. till 2 p.m. for 1 hour stand at the front door greeting customers and offering a flyer, answering questions. When not a greeter, working stock, ordering stock, helping customers, keying locks if needed, and shelf maintenance. "
good,I really liked the hours working here they were real flexible and worked with u on making sure u got what you needed. Easy labor and nice workers is what keeps u coming back
good,Overall Great work expericence. Moved up in a short amount of time. I learned alot about customer service. Hardest part about the job was also the diffrenent managment coming in and out
good,I worked Monday through Friday and it was fun meeting new customers. Great products they sell there for house improvement. Always a good time with the co-workers.
good,"I would come into work, walk around my department and check for safety hazards and make sure there was no garbage or debris in the aisles. I would stock the shelves from inventory. I would make sure the night crew finished what they had to do so we would be ready to open for the public. Throughout the day I would assist customers and management with whatever tasks were asked of me."
good,"The job is a productive job and allows for multiple opportunities to be productive throughout the day, whether helping customers or other associates. The environment is very friendly and the associates are great to work with"
good,Its a great place to work I loved my job sadly they dont believe in keeping people who put in effort. They only keep those they favor. The over all atmosphere was great though and the work was exactly what I needed to get the day through.
good,"Home Depot environment was very nice, inclusive, pleasant.  They had great incentive a cafeteria with a big variety and a gym, free parking but their compensation package sucked."
good,"I loved the job and working with the many customers. most of the managers were very helpful and instructional. The job had plenty of variety in a day to make it interesting and challenging. The only bad thing is, the customer is always right even when they're wrong and employees have lost their jobs on just the customers word."
good,"Busy fast paced a lot of heavy lifting, a good summer job never a dull moment,  always something to do ,  it's a fun place to work ....good job experience I liked it."
good,Very good place to work. Very busy in the summer season and they give you overtime on a regular basis which makes a good paycheck if needed. Overall a great place to wofrk.
good,"Go to work and spend four to eight hours either being a customer service rep or a cashier. Depending on shift there is two fifteen minutes and one half hour or an hour lunch break."
good,"Great company to work for. Programs like the Home Fund and Home Depot Foundation are awesome. Huge lack of good management, there is a huge amount of turnover because of bad managers."
good,Home Depot is a wonderful place to work. They are very accommodating to your needs. I have seen the wonderful work you do for the community. I will want to continue to work here but I just need a full-time position.
good,Enjoy working there great place great people treat me with a lot of respect they really make fun not a lot of stress come in do my job like I need to.
good,I did cashiering and sales. It was an interesting place to work. I was cross trained in many departments. The coworkers and management were friendly and easy to work with.
good,My typical day is to make sure my register and area is clear and ready to assist customers. I learned a lot about do it yourself projects. The workplace is overall busy and rewarding. Most of the managers did recognize employees for outstanding work. The hardest part of working there was dealing with some unsatisfied customer. The most enjoyable was learning and getting to know people on daily basis and what kind of project they may have been doing.
good,Learned a lot about the retail life in general. Learned how to properly handled customers. Good and bad. Scheduling was a downfall cause you never knew what days you had off.
good,The company takes care of its employees well and gives fair hours and works well within your schedule however the higher ups do not listen to constructive criticism well.
good,"Great benefits,  great people work there,  if you're a great worker be prepared to be over worked and underpaid.  If you're looking for a clock riding job this is perfect for you, you'll make the same as the good workers and do half the work.  Don't ask for a raise you get $.50 a year and that's it."
good,Enjoyed the other empolyees and their knowledge's. Found the environment wonderful and challenging. It was important to find answers for questions and customers needs. It was a growing environment.
good,"I enjoyed my time at The Home Depot and only left because I moved too far away. The store was well run and maintained, I always felt like the managers and head cashiers were doing their jobs well without being too demanding on their workers. There was always enough staff for the location and everyone worked together well. Hours were flexible and worked around my school schedule. The pay was pretty standard for the job but I did get benefits working there part time. The environment was fast paced and the days usually went by pretty fast. If i had to nitpick one thing it would be that The Home Depot doesn't give its employees any store discount, but there were other benefits given."
good,Great company to work for but moving up is cut throat and is more about popularity than actual ability to work making everyone's job difficult picking up the slack
good,This place offers a lot of advancement if you're flexible. The company also provides useful customer service training that you can utilize in the real world.
good,"- Great people to work with, management included"
good,All in all they where a good place to work. I'm a full time student and they where very good at accommodating that. Good co-workers. Safe environment.

good,my experience working at Home Depot was exciting and fun. I learned a lot about different departments and how to execute my work assignments during a work shift.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Home Depot, thus why I worked for them for 14 years. The management team was usually very good. Retail hours and pay is never really good. The environment was very family orientated, well treated in that way. Customer service change and the directional from 1999 to 2013, I think it was better in the earlier years."
good,"Advancement occurs more slowly, but does occur.  Work hours are variable,  some flexibility which is good.  The culture can be tricky at times depending on the personalities you're working with."
good,Home Depot is a physically demanding retail job. If they see you are a fit individual they will take advantage because none of the older out of shape employees want to do any physical labor. This is a great starting job to gain experience. There is growth potential but you have to be at the right store at the right time and work very hard.
good,I enjoyed the hands on aspect of the job and  constantly staying busy. I  was able to build displays and work with my hands. Handled all of the inventory in the lumber department and kept track of what was being ordered.
good,"Great job experience and introduction to big box retail culture.  I learned a supply chain, inventory control and conflict resolution between the retail store and corporate environment.  I enjoyed the busy work days and the sense of accomplishment at the end of each day."

good,"This was a great job and I loved it, Other employees were great and I loved what I did. My only complaint is I came in as a temp for a long time and the position they seemed to want to keep in a temp status and I was looking for something that had a little more to offer."
good,"Love the company and the job details, the management at the Bradford store needs to be replaced, alot of ""favoritism"" no accountability for associates. The current management isthereason I am looking elsewhere for employment.  The prior management was fantastic. TheHome Depot as a company is great with the exception of the pay, should be higher and based on performance of the individual not a sliding scale."
good,"This is a great place to work it has great benefit and you do have a chance to move up in the company they hands on training,they pay for your education if you want to further it. Also they go out there way for veterans help build home and give them a job that is what made me work for the company"

good,"Home Depot has been a great experience to work for.  I have learned many skills that I will take with me to another job. The hardest part of the job is that it is a very physical job and my body is not equipped to continue much longer.  I love all the customers and interaction with them.  Many customers are in daily or very often. The management does a great job and work with their employees and their needs. The company has many positive benefits for employees. I will miss it on many levels, however a change is needed."
good,"Considero que mi desempeño en esta empresa fue gratificante aprendi a desarrolar mas habilidades y aponer en practica las mias, fue dificil las jornadas y que en ocasiones no las pagaban pero tenia prestaciones de ley lo cual para una persona como yo .

Clean the isles and make the product presentable. While at the Home Depot I learned to interact with my colleagues to get our work done in the most efficient manner. The managers were fair and taught us the in and outs of the store. I had to train almost all my co workers. All of them learned quick and were hard workers. The hardest part of the job were the rotating schedules. One day I would be scheduled to close at 12 am, and the next I had to be back at the store at 5 am. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping out people."
good,The customers were always nice and helpful to all cashiers. The team was helpful and always gave product knowledge if anyone asked. Hours were good and never stayed to late.

good,"Everyone always comes together to complete the task of satisfying customers and their needs. The hardest part of working here is not knowing what kind of people are going to walk through the front doors, but we always welcome them with open arms and expect the best."
good,"Very teamwork oriented employer, flexable hours, ability to learn different specialties if wanted. Over-time is minimal, sometimes short handed in the evenings. Managers very knowlegable, easy to get along with."
good,"I was a cashier for almost 8 months at The Home Depot. The co-workers are amazing, and the management members for the most part really try to help you. I learned how to really give the customer what they want which includes customer service, and answers to their questions. A typical day was busy with bursts of people at different ends of the store, which called for me to literally run from one end to another to get lines down in record timing. The most enjoyable part would be at the end of the day after everyone has left and all the workers got together about their greatest success of the day."
good,"I learned a lot of valuable knowledge while working there. Great people to work with."

good,"supervisar y manejar reportes para lograr resultados tales como control de merma y ventas."
good,"This is indeed one of the best jobs, work environments, and co-worker associations I've ever experienced. Even though my supervisor and I would occasionally bump heads when it came to methods of operations, we eventually established a common ground. I earned associate of the month twice. My co-workers and I got along great with no drama what-so-ever. I loaded and/or unloaded trucks all day long, so the days went by quickly. At the time, my girlfriend and I shared a car, and she got off work when I had to be to work. So, for the last 6 months or so that I worked there, I was frequently tardy. They allowed me to change shifts to prevent this, but I had to change back due to lack of seniority. Eventually I was terminated due to tardiness, which really frustrated me because this was the only job where I actually liked going to work everyday. Haven't had a steady job since."

good,"Met interesting people at this job. I was in a good location. I learned new techniques, loved that they give you good hours if you are hired full time, great coworkers as well as near great entertainment locations"
good,"Very rewarding experience overall. Benefits and reward incentives are great. However, management training is non existent.  Most advancement into management is done internally.  And the expected dedication to the job is 24-7, especially in the field."
good,Store atmosphere can be intense at times.  Team oriented training and Performance Review policy keeps a pretty tight Team atmosphere.
good,All in a really good place to work as long as you enjoy a fast pace and can handle change.  Always looking for the high potential and sometimes overlooks the great steady performer.
good,as a part time job this is  a great place to work.  You can learn new products every day and get certified in all departments.

good,"A typical day at work in the painting department is quiet slow on the weekdays. I walked into this job not knowing anything about paint. Three months later, I feel like I have became a pro. The co-workers are very outgoing. Everyone gets along just fine. The hardest part of the job is when it is not busy, time goes by slowly. The most enjoyable parts of the job is on the weekends. You're busy throughout your whole shift,"
good,"would never want a management position. Too much dog eat dog. Asm's will generally be fine, but upper management will fire you for most any error"
good,"Many associates come up to me and ask me questions that sometimes only an HR can answer or management. I do my best to take care of the associate and if I do not know an answer, I will be honest and let them know I will get the answer and get back to them. Relationships are important in the work places. The more you work together, the better your day can be."
good,The manager at the Home Depot was very good he worked with each employee to help them reach their goals as an associate. All employees worked together as a team.
good,Many sales lost due to insufficient personnel on the sales floor. Outside of that good Co. Constant training and updating within the dept.
good,"I truly enjoy working at Home Depot but the only complaint that I have about it is that people in the position that I am in do not get to become full time, nor are we guaranteed any set hours. I feel that if customers are repeatedly making it known that a certain associate is going above and beyond to give great customer service, that associate should be rewarded with more hours or the opportunity to be promoted to full time."
good,Great Company needs more quality workers hired and better pay for the good workers. Also movement within the company is great and there is so much to do to help out in d
good,Learned a lot about merchandising and how to make it appeal to customers.  Great to work with such a diverse group of people.

good,A typical day at Home Depot is sometimes good. You sometimes deal with rude and obnoxious customers but working here seems to be a good decision. The management isn't so good and my co-workers are easy to talk to. The hardest part of this job is having a flexible schedule. I enjoy that Home Depot still provides benefits and discounts online for its associates.
good,At the Home Depot customers come first always and if you can handle and enjoy that then you will be fine. You can't let angry people ruin your day because of their mistakes.
good,Great management with great people to work around. Great company to grow with. Willing to teach you if your are willing to learn.

I rarely have bad days at work, I have learned how to juggle my job responsibilities well. my management team is an exceptional one. the only con I would have to say about any of my co-workers or supervisors is that sometimes it is hard to communicate with them. I usually only have access to them via phone and when there is no response it can make things complicated. the hardest part of the job can be not getting a response when needed. and the most enjoyable part of the job is when you know that you have helped a customer and cheered up their day."

good,"I've enjoyed working for the company."
good,"A typical day is filled with challenges and hard work. A Lead Generator is more than going up to someone asking them if they would like someone to install a particular item in their house, it's building a connection with them that is going to leave them happy knowing Home Depot did a satisfactory job in their work. As an employee at Home Depot you not only deal with the customers, you also encourage and motivate your fellow associates in the process. The hardest part about being a lead generator is having your fellow associates participate in the events that you plan to bring in more customers. Our management team is pretty good as far as our Store Manager and Assistant Store Manager, but our Specialty Assistant Store Manager is the deal breaker, she is hard to communicate with and makes my job more difficult that it should be. I enjoy my job when dealing with the customers as far as my fellow associates it's another story."

Management wise I'm always encouraging my fellow associates to give their best; Acknowledging their strengths and weaknesses; Making sure that all operations off the job is being performed at a high level of productivity and safety. Help resolve work related issues as they occur. The hardest part of the jobs was leaving to go home for the rest of the day or night. The most important part of the job was seeing a smile of satisfaction on a customers face and acknowledging the associate that put it there.
good,This job was fun to have it was great everytime i walkedin the doors. Because i motivate employers to make the best out of their job
good,Great people who allowed me to grow and continue my education.  I was very fortunate to work with such generous people.
good,"I love my Job as a Cashier at Home Depot, My co- workers are great and very friendly.  I am a Cashier at Home Depot and I serve customers on a regular daily basis.  The hardest part of my Job is not being able to see my Daughters, I honestly can say that if it weren't for the lack of hours I wouldn't be looking else where for a job.

Being as most of us relocated to Georgia with the company; we all shared that common bond. The hardest part of the job was pleasing the customer's even when the error was no fault of ours. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers with their home improvement needs.

good,It was great working with my team as a supervisor. Some how getting things done and working together creates a better work place. Starting with first phone duties and assigning task as I start on my own is a typical day for myself. Reviewing reports and turning them in in a timely manner was daily aswell. The most enjoyable part of the job is actually taking care of the customer and solving their problems and finalizing their projects.
good,"Excellent place to work. The atmosphere is ideal and if retail is a desired industry, this is your path. Benefits are amazing and opportunities are waiting for you."

good,"I enjoyed working with my co workers in neighboring depts and exchanging knowledge with each other. Management for the most part was very fair and approachable. My works days typically kept me busy when I arrived to work everyday. I was normally either interacting with customers or prepping/stocking the dept. The hardest part of the job for me was stocking the shelves, only because I quickly found my niche in interacting with customers, which I was not very fond of when I first started with the company.

good,"I'm the night shift for receiving and freight, I love my managers and my team. But I will say that job is not for everyone it is non stop intence physical labor. I feel the pay to work balance is off and could be looked at especially for the night shift .. I love this job just think that thay should pay for the amount of work they demand."
good,I enjoyed everything I was just moving there and needed a job but grew to love it the only problem was I couldn’t maintain with the pay it was really hard
good,Great co workers and helpful employees to help further your career opportunities.  Computer training for better knowledge monthly on helping your knowledge of products to provide knowledge for the customer experience.
good,"A typical day at Home Depot was usually a good one for me. I was always greeted with a hello and a smile from many of my co-workers. I was treated equally, being that I was the only woman and the shortest person on the freight team. The people I worked with were friendly, humorous and overall a joy to be around. I got to put in extra hours if I need them and my supervisors were very understanding and looked out for my well being. I honestly loved working here for the time that I did."
good,Love the work not how it's ran. It starts at the top and it ruins the store as a whole. My position was very stressful. I love the company as a whole. The benefits are nice. No discounts but other perks are awesome.
good,"a typical day would be dealing with customer questions and concerns about what we have in the store and what products to use, i also learned how to do paint matching, what interior/exterior products to use for their projects, management couldn't be anymore cooler.. they are the best, the hardest part of the job is dealing with numerous customers at the same time while they are a little understaffed, and the most enjoyable part about the job was making lasting impressions on all customers which lead to some really great friendships"
good,"This is a nice place to work, with clean environment and neat organization of aisles and shelves, is an interesting place to reach knowledge about home improvement, tools and project solutions."
good,It wasn’t a bad job although the management could have been better. The hardest part was maybe the customers being upset coming to the register after an employee didn’t want to help them
good,"I learned about different tools, how to use them, and how to be a better salesperson, The hardest part about the job is learning about tools you never heard of or used but fun."
good,The job itself was fast paced and I knew what I signed up for and was ready to learn and work . Would love to go back if they hav any openings available even if it’s not in the same department I was originally in. Although most workers need to work on there way of communication and to not ignore one another.
good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo seguridad , solo que empiezan a recortar gastos y a limitar más tu comisiones"
good,My store is wonderful to work at. They really appreciate their associates and the various jobs we do. Their number one goal is to provide quality customer service and it really is effective
good,"Since my schedule went to a set schedule, I love the job.  It is slow and somewhat boring in the beginning of the shift through the week especially this time of year.  I would be best out on the floor in a merchandising position but this set schedule fits my needs at this time.  "
good,I loved working here everyone was so nice and helpful they would have outside cookouts for the employees on summer holidays. The customers were always polite.
good,This job can be fast paced on certain days but most of the time it's very relaxed and the customers tend to be very friendly.  Most of the times you'd get customers who have no idea what they're doing so this where your knowledge gets tested but it's an overall pleasant experience.
good,was a very good work environment and was very welcoming. co-workers were willing to cover for eachother when it came to cover breaks. the connection was of family like atmosphere. and the customers were very nice as well. with contractors coming through all the time it was a very nice place to work where some days it felt like it wasn't even work. it was fun and laid back
good,I’ve been with the company for almost 6 years and I’ve learned so much about home improvements. Management could be a little better but it’s a working progress. Everyone treats each other like family and we always have each other’s back. Super big on safety!
good,"This is probably the case for most places, but if management is bad, you're screwed. "
good,Workplace culture is good. Monetary compensation is weak. Emphasis is on hiring part-time employees. Older employees are expected to train new (young) workers at no extra compensation to the trainers.
good,Great company to work for. Team work was always encouraged and family always came first. Management was always aroynd when needed and never made me feel less than. Great advancement opportunities and my store always promoted from within before going outside to fill an open position.
good,The company really takes care of its employees really well. Good environment.  They train employees so they can advance to other departments.  Team cooperative.
good,"Customer  service comes first ,always"
good,Overall a good and fun place to work. Plenty of opportunities to succeed. If we got a certain amount of credit card sign ups we got put on a list. Whoever had the most per week got to make their own schedule for the following week. Fun atmosphere and friendly people to work with.
good,"Family man able to actually make ends meet and pay my bills with a job that is full of wonderful people. Never settle for less than you’re worth, take a job like this over restaurants IF EVER POSSIBLE."
good,"Great place to work if you are still in school or taking classes. They work with you to get a schedule made around your class schedule. A lot of people also work there part time and Home Depot works with you on that as well, plus they have great benefits."
good,"At he home depot, it was always fun and having a great time working but what I loved most about working there was how everyone was customer driven and how we tried to do everything in our power to help the customers! I loved how everyday was something different. Such a great company to work for!"
good,"I enjoy everyday at the Depot. Management staff is excellent, my peers and I work well as a Team. It is very hard work but it is very fulfilling atmosphere."
good,"A typical day would be meeting, greeting, knowing your product in the store. Pack down, clean, straighten, build displays and cross merchandising being creative with sighs, displays and clip strips along with co-works at running equipment to drop pallets. In all business there will be good or great management and then you have the other side. Just go in do a good job and less talk other then with customer and it will be a great place to work. The most enjoyable part of my jobs and departments i was always learning something new and i like the challenge to have top sales."
good,The leadership team does a great job helping each associate grow within the company. Everyday I have the opportunity to learn not only from my team members and management but also from my customers.
good,"Great place to work with many opportunities. If you show up and suit up, they'll keep you on and find places for you to work when the slow season comes. Training is minimal, so your best bet is to ask a lot of questions and do some research on your work area on your free time."
good,"Overall great company to work for with great benefits like health care, vision, dental and more.  Compensation for all associates with opportunity to receive bonuses twice a year.   Not many companies offer that."
good,was a very easy and fun job. had a lot of fun competing in home many credit card approvals we got in a day. the only downside is you can not leave your station if it gets slow
good,"a typical day was enjoyable"
good,"Too many conflicting orders, multiple managers giving you different tasks."
good,"I used to work in the tool rental section. I would go in, change into my work boots and open the doors to my department. Then I would proceed to unlock the vans and trucks. Afterwards would return to my department and start any contracts and answer questions."
good,"A job is a job, whether a personal enjoyable profession that may transition into a passion, or a ""I don't want to get up,"" ""what am I doing with my life"" clock-in, clock-out ""glad today's over with im done for the day..until tomorrow"" kind of job, it pays and it is experience that may in turn help you grow as an individual, providing skills and traits that can carry a lifetime. The Home Depot for me was just that. I can appreciate having a job like Home Depot and everything I've learned and am glad to be able to say that I was a Home Depot associate! Especially since orange is my favorite color!"
good,"While I may no longer work there, Home Depot was a great company to work for my management team and peers were like a second family to me and the gave me the stepping stone needed to move on."
good,excellent management and opportunity for growth. The pay was ok for part-time. Worked in tool rental dept. that had good management that provided opportunities to learn and grow within the department.
good,"If you enjoy working with customers then The Home Depot is a great place to work.  Customer service is a large part of the culture at Home Depot.  From helping customers find products to helping them plan renovations it is very satisfying place to work.  Associates are given opportunities to excel in customer service and are recognized when having done so."
good,My job was assistant management to assist customer  Special order purchases doors  & window Also working with Installer schedule appt for there installs
good,Home depot was a pleasant place to work with a nice family atmosphere. The customers you get to know them because it's the same people for the most part.
good,A typical day at work includes completing everyday tasks like front facing merchandise and assisting customers who need advice and recommendations. I learned alot about operations and home improvement along with social skills since working there. The culture is cool. The environment and employee culture feels like a family more than a business. The hardest part of my job was the amount of work and tasks i was asked to complete at times. My store did not have much man power so i was often depended on to do heavy lifting and things as such.
good,Great people worked there. Very team oriented and very organized. Lots of heavy lifting. Fast paced environment as you are timed on how long it takes to empty an ENTIRE tractor trailer full of boxes. If you work out and exercise you'll love this job. You have to be strong and focused as there is a system to unloa8the trailer.
good,Report to your supervisor for the a assignment for that day.  Shock and down load products.  Help customers and help as needed.  Electric ladder was fun to learn and high on respect to all culture.
good,"You learn alot and they have a good work environment and values. Very busy environment,  lots of teaming up on jobs. Also can be good for your health because of manual labor."
good,"Home Depot treated me good by giving me the hours that I asked for, but I never did get a raise once I got certified for all the equipment. I’m not the type of person to ask for a raise because I like to let my work speak for itself and I felt that I was doing good as an associate, but I never did get that raise. I’m just looking for a better paying job where I can drive the forklift, they trained me very well and I want to put my talents into another job."
good,Good place to build a career and grow into the company. You may very likely start part time but always room for growth and advancement. Get to know the company outside of your own job.
good,"PLUS, Point/s:"
good,The Home Depot RDC is a very friendly place with a welcoming work environment. The most enjoyable part about this job is being able to meet new people with the positive energy that is in the warehouse while you are there.
good,home depot is a great place to work where i feel valued as a valuable associate even if I'm only a sales associate. i am a person who only manages basic customer help and basic organizational tasks.
good,"The tools needed to succeed at the job is provided. It is important that these tools are utilized. As a new associate, ensure to ask questions and be able to retain a lot of information quickly."
good,"You learn a lot here and really can develop in exterior sales.  Everything though, came to a halting stop, when about 85% of the exterior reps in the nation were laid off."
good,"The company saying is ""If you take care of the employees, the employees will take care of the customers, and the profits will take care of themselves"", and the store I worked at stuck true to that. management was great and I had a lot of fun working there. It's currently the only job I've worked not related to what I'm studying in college that I actually enjoyed. Many of the people I worked with were retired and just worked there part time because they wanted something to do and enjoyed it. If it wasn't a good place to work they wouldn't be there."
good,Working at Home Depot can be intense at times. You must pace yourself though. You will not be able to get everything done in one day. It can be tough at times but the employees are pretty nice.
good,"AWESOME teamwork, customer service and organizing time management skills. Also is great to learn about home improvements.Hteat to learn about diversity."
good,"I miss working here. Great management, coworkers, and environment. Understanding of family emergencies. More like a family than work place. Comfortable staff room/lounge. A lot of training. Totally prepared for the job when put on the floor."
good,"The home depot is an amazing place to work. If you are someone willing to put in the time, and I mean 15 to 20 years getting paid hourly, this is the place for you. I am motivated by progression and upwards mobility, which unfortunately my employer does not offer frequently enough."
good,"I was most happy with their education program.  Home Depot taught  its employees about how to do each department.  They allowed be to take time off for  a trip to Spain and Portugal to improve my Spanish skills."
good,"home Depot is a great company with a lot of opportunities. The management team is always willing to teach and you the business. Being with the company for 13 yrs I have grown a lot and when it comes to my coworkers we are here for each other. Supporting each other every step of the way.  As a Customer Service Specialist Im given the opportunity to work with many different vendors, installers, and customer on a ray of level.  From fixing issues to getting down to why the customer was satisfied with an install.  From faxing, to emailing to conference call and meetings I can communicate on many different level from cooperate and the sales associate"
good,great team support great working environment and recognition awards for work performance. Manager was customer service orientated which made the working environment better.
good,"•	Supervised and delegated work load amongst an average of ~15 associates on a daily, ensuring that the operations for receiving, sorting and stocking freight was successfully accomplished "
good,Good place to work for me. Worked 16 years in three different states. Would still be working there if I could have been able to transfer to New York from North Carolina . Had good benefits & good pay. Hoped that I could have been able to transfer.
good,"Overall good environment to work in. No complaints.  Good co-workers."
good,I worked with an excellent manager and asm’s. It was an excellent experience. Unfortunately my old store had been through too many mangers . Everyone was friendly and kicked off my retail experience as I look back on it. Excellent training and on the spot learning experiences.
good,"I loved working at home depot my department management was extremely understanding when it came to home life interfering with work occasionally, they were very flexible with time off and needing to switch shifts etc  my co workers were wonderful people who worked hard and were kind, funny and respectful."
good,It's an awesome company to work for. They believes in taking care of their people. The company give their associates room to grow with the company and become great leaders.
good,All in all I enjoyed my job at Home Depot.  Your co-workers can be very back stabbing and two faced! Stay out of the DRAMA.... Home Depot is an amazing place to employ people who have disabilities. I mean this truly. The management will do their best to help you in anyway possible.  I didn't have issues with management.  My issue was with a employee that went out of the way to mess with other employees. Management knew it and did nothing because of her disabilities. I felt if she was held accountable for the money in a register she should be accountable for what came out her mouth!
good,"Working at Home Depot is OK. They have always accommodated my needs when I needed specific days off, the work schedule is somewhat flexible. The management is understanding and easy to work with. My favorite part of the job is the interaction with customers."
good,"its a friendly enviroment,helpfull wirking staffs,not much fun of the management on my shift sometimes.but it was just a regular overnight shift.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,Inbound calls be customers with questions of products we carry online and in the store. Assist in placing orders and reviewing orders. Everyone is skilled different and performance is key.
good,The mornings were busier and were fun because of how busy it was; same with night time shifts. daytime was sometimes slow. Weekends were very busy. you can easily call in to pick-up shifts
good,"Worked at Home Depot for 2 years."
good,Getting to meet people and help them with their issues. Being able to help someone is a great sense of accomplishment. It allows you to be open minded. It allows you to help make someone's day better than when they came in.
good,Very fun workplace. Enjoyed fellow employees aswell as the customers. The bennifits were outstanding. Lovely invirorment. Very relaxing job with no stress or pressure.
good,"A good place to work if you're in high school or going through college. Not a career, but an honest company that takes care of its employees. Consistent raises."
good,Great place to work while in college. As a cashier they do not offer many hours . For a set schedule at the store apply for Merchandising or the freight team
good,The Home Depot is a good place to work. Sometimes management isn't always on the same page and things do not get communicated in a timely manner. The associates that work at The Home Depot are friendly and they don't mind helping out and lending a hand. There are many great opportunities that can surface from being apart of The Home Depot team.
good,"Sales were at a record high, however the management of installs, lack there of and accountability caused the Exteriors to close down.  If the install side of the business was managed like the sales side or in the store they would still by operating."
good,"It was a good opportunity. I enjoyed working here for the few years that I did. Now, I will continue to pursue better careers with all I learned from the company."
good,"A typical day working was clocking in and going straight to the front to assist any customer. If no help is needed go outside to maintain the parking lot. I've learned how to operate systems within the home depot, operate cash register, how to be a safe worker, and how to work with others in a proper manner. Management was great, very friendly, would assist you in every way possible if you were struggling. The hard part was trying to be in several places at once as a individual. Working inside the store as well as outside the store was great, also operating the fork lift and seeing co-workers everyday as well as the customers."
good,I believe this is a stepping stone job to help you build a future in which ever career you choose. The company does try to take care of there employees.
good,I learned how to be more organized. How to handle solution with problem and best ways in handling it.  Their was not that much difficulty with my job and the most enjoyable part of my job was working in my favorite department and being able to give answers with the knowledge I had in order to help customers with what they needed to best serve the and helped customers with why they came to the store in the first placed and give them best service that I was able to provide for them to want to come back and shop at the store I worked for.
good,It is a great company to work for.  The hours are flexible and the stress level is not too bad. The manager is great to work with and the culture is a diverse one.  The hardest part of the job is when everyone doesn't show up for the shift and I have learned to adapt.
good,"Through the 2 years that I have worked for The Home Depot, the company always takes care of their associates. Every location provides a very family-like environment where associate and management are friendly towards each other and work together as a team to achieve a common goal."
good,I enjoyed my time at The Home Depot.  It was typically a fast-paced work environment with challenges on a regular basis.  I appreciated the opportunities for problem solving and that I was allowed to implement solutions to those problems that arose.
good,"I really enjoy working for Home Depot, but the hours worked and pay alone are not enough to support me.  The team I am a part of is great in the sense that we all keep in good communication with each other and work well together.  The company has many benefits available along with discounts for various services and venues.  The environment is relaxed and overall pleasant."
good,It wasn't easy at the service desk it got stressful and hard. At times customers were upset with you for no reason and it was something you had to be able to traverse while maintaining good customer service. But doing the job good was very rewarding mentally and it was a good job for anyone who is looking to work for their money.
good,"I wish they would honor college degrees better then time on a job, equal rights  and not who you know. the Home Depot culture is very amazing, helping customers and safety is truly important"
good,"As a first job or a side job this works well. You can get much accomplished here and learn alot about your work ethic. May you know however, you’ll be working hard!"
good,I love working there but the pay was too low. Working at home depot you had projects and customers. Training was also involve with paid training to know department knowledge.
good,Love working with my fellow employees!  The actual job is ruff.  I am responsible for all trucks in and out.  Credit on return merchandise. The worse part is working by myself.
good,A typical day at work as a manager can be challenging but also enjoyable. Working with numerous people like customers and associates is enjoyable for me. I've gained so much knowledge with my time at the Home Depot and met a lot of positive people along the way. The hardest part of my job was dealing with multiple personalities and associate's complaints. other than that I really enjoyed my job.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was mentoring associates. Developing and training associates to excel with the company."
good,Worked under original management with ease and success. Under new management opportunities were limited by new scheduling system and underhanded promotion techniques. I could have advanced in retail but chose to leave this particular location for an actual career.
good,Overall great if you want to advance in the company. I have learned how to take care of multiple customers at one time. Lifting is the hardest part of the job. Interaction with management is encouraging.
good,"It's a very fast paced company, with so much to learn, everyday is a different day."
good,"Great place to work the job is easy if you love what you do ,your always learning something new. They take commitment to the job very serious and it makes you appreciate the job more because they make you feel like you mean something to the team"
good,Great job has some of the best associates you could work with. Not everyday you get the same experience ant that’s wonderful. You get to meet and greet new people every day.
good,"Working at Home Depot was a job I wish I could go back to. Even though the managers were strict, I actually really loved how they gave you time to vomplete tasks, didn't pressure or rush anyone, and how we were encouraged to ask for help or work as a team. It was one of the best jobs I've had."
good,"The environment of the Home Depot is to take care of ""their' people and the rest will take of itself.  If you want to, you can learn a lot and grow in the company.  Home Depot prefers to promote from within than to hire new for a managerial position."
good,"It was a pretty good work environment, I was employee of the month one month which was the first job i was called that. Employees were friendly and i enjoyed working there"
good,A typical work day at the home depot is pretty fast paced but manageable at the same time. The hardest task faced during the day is helping multiple customers at once.
good,"This was my second job, and as it was only part time and only doing Freight, it was by far my favorite job, I enjoyed coming to work every day and had a tremendous amount of respect for my mangers."
good,"Nice place to work , good management, Room  to grow. Learning experiences. Good training and new ideas every day. Engage in activities and customer experiences."
good,"A warm greeting from your boss makes your day goes easier. With the help of managers the effectiveness  and dedication helps the operation to run smoothly. The hardest part was to fill in for another employee that was on leave, however this allows me to use my multitasking skills and able to accomplish tasks as needed. The most enjoyable part is when all decline was met and managers treats us with free meals."
good,I enjoyed working for The Home Depot was not happy with the new store manager and the new APM   but as company the best company I have ever worked for and I would work for them again.
good,"I would get there at 5:30, we start work at 6:00 am. then morning stretches then work lunch and 11:00 am to 11:30. then back to work and we end the day at 2:30 pm. I learned how to put order in the computer and print out labels for the product to be ready for shipment.. The hardest part was staying busy when it was slow, or ran out of material. what i enjoyed the most was learning how to drive every forklift in the building."
good,"Working at Home Depot SSC  in  the  Building Service Department"
good,"some days are better than others. as long as you bring that positive attitude to work, days will be great. The problem is when you cart that Homelife into worklife you could bring negativity with it."
good,Great supply chain company. Go people. Good culture. Low pay. Lots of growth. Job everywhere. Good mix of experience. Loves military. Good diversity. Nice folks.
good,Loved working with the different departments and learning their processes. It is retail so the best and worst part of the job are the customers. It can be fast paced at times but i enjoyed it.
good,"The Home Depot is a company that has thrived in recent years and this is based on their culture. The Home Depot believes that if they take care of their employees they will take care of their customers, and everything else takes care of its self."
good,"I worked at the Bellevue Home Depot from 2012-2015 and it was one of the best jobs I've ever had. The management was great my co-workers were great. Also, you learn so much about hardware and paint working there. It's very hands-on and you'll never get bored. They also treat their employees great by giving free lunches, throwing holiday parties, making the breakroom comfortable, giving bonuses, and many more things. Management treated their employees really well and fairly and for the most part, the customers were great to interact with. I would recommend this job for anyone that is a college student or for first time employment."
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work, lots to learn. The pay is not equal to the work you do. Raises are no more than $.45 per year for general employees."
good,"I liked working at the Home Depot, I learned a lot,  I started as a cashier, went to returns and ended up in the paint Dept.  I got training all over the store including Garden, tools, plumbing, flooring and garden. I would go back to home depot."
good,"Take this with a grain of salt, I worked in the garden department and loved it. My days were routine and focused on truly helping customers, not just upselling. The hardest part of this job was and will always be packing down and working the warehouse portion of the job, especially during inventory season. Store management was approachable and readily available, and I only had one bad department lead."
good,"Home Depot was a great temporary job! Started at 10.00 an hour and they worked with my college schedule. I then transferred stores and everything went smooth, also got a bonus during holiday season"
good,Company promotes themselves on customer service when it all comes down to numbers in sales. That will secure your job and advancement. Newly higher assistant managers fire well working employees if they do not see eye to eye.
good,Good place to work in an clean and serene work environment with en excellent job culture. I really enjoyed working with an friendly an effecient management team.
good,"Good place to work for. "
good,"although the company had on going training in place and it was consistent for your development in the company, it was hard to get everyone  to commit  to helping all customers in any dept.""That was sad to me"" and very stressful."
good,"It was a good company to work for with flexible hours and great people. Not much advance in pay, but the culture is great. They do have a lot of different positions that are suited for anyone's needs."
good,"strong management"
good,"It was wonderful to start early in the morning and end you day before lunch. This position no longer exists at Home Depot, unfortunately. The days went extremely fast."
good,"I Love interacting with my customers., therefore late evenings prevent this interaction."
good,"Getting to know the customers was the best part."
good,"I loved my job as Team Lead at The Home Depot.  I was based in a call-center setting that handled all of the installs for the San Diego region stores.  I was on track to be promoted to a supervisor when, in January, 2009 the company decided to eliminate the Team Lead position at my location along with a record number of store associate jobs (over 1,000 employees were let go in one day).  I was disappointed that the company failed to try to place me in another position, especially since I was a consistently top-performing employee with almost seven years dedicated to this company."
good,"Was a full time employee for 12 years, thought I was going to retire with them. New assistant mgr came in and completely reorganize flooring and decor dept. caused upset, if you were not terminated, you quit. He finally was removed but not after department and existing employees were gone. Yes management does stick together and the turn over is high with the regular employees. Great stepping stone to students. Yes company policy changes often, depending on sales, most retail companies do this. Sometimes their policy can be rediculous but the most part tolerable."
good,"I've been doing the over night freight going on 3 years. I've had 4 different supervisors in that time. Summer is our crazy time of year and it gets very stressful. It fast past and fun, but hard work. People come and go and it's a pain the train new people in the busy season. This would be a great first job. Not to many people say more than a year."
good,I got to teach plumbing to customers. The biggest problem I had was that my philosophy was different than most customers. I was very busy and learn their SKU system.
good,Overall great experience for a part-time position. Senior manager was horrible but junior managers fostered a  more cohesive environment. As with any position you can make the best of it or move to something you feel more comfortable with.  I was flexible and worked several departments in a highly effective manner.
good,Most annoying part was definitely the customers but management was friendly and the workplace was pretty laid back. Wasnt a hard job and I learned better communication skills
good,"Met many good people working for ""The Home Depot"". Had many good times and memories. Home Depot threw us a Christmas party at Crystal Gardens which was very nice. They handed out I pads, TV's, video game systems. They gave out rewards for going above and beyond. Fun and great company to work for."
good,It was a great place to work. The environment was friendly and inviting. Mangers made sure to pass word of plenty of opportunity of advancement as well as goals for the day.
good,Great benefits but a high turnover in help management has changed over the years I worked here and I don't always agree with some of the changes that have occurred I am looking for work closer to home
good,Enjoyed working at The Home Depot! Loved helping out the customers and answering all their concerns and showing them and teaching them more on product knowledge.
good,"people I work with are fabulous, no opportunity for advancement, dealing with rude customers, with no back up from management is the hardest part,the most enjoyable part is working in the garden center"
good,Excellent place to work as a first job or easy part time job while in college or high school. Super flexible hours with amazing coworkers. Everyone is so friendly and nice and will to help you out.
good,The place is a good deal but it has its up and down good to get retail experience but when the company has let u go they will because is all business.
good,"Home depot is a good place to work "
good,"In the garden center, I was able to utilize my knowledge as both a Master Gardener and Master Naturalist. "
good,"Greeting customers with a positive attitude, making sure to cash them out in a speedy fashion. Also, being able to know the store departments and pointing customers in the right direction. Having knowledge on certain items in store insuring the customer you are willing to help."
good,I loved working at home depot . the employees are very nice and welcoming. they pay really good. the benefits are for part time and full time workers.
good,Everyone at the home depot is very helpful and always wanting for the customers that went in to come back and buy more items from home depot. It's a quick paced environment
good,"I was very surprised at all the benefits for employees.  Almost everything is covered and as long as you pass your probation period, there are many corporate perks."
good,Its my current job that I'm on medical leave from at this time.They seem fair and  equitable to their employee's. Great Benefits and a camaraderie that leaves me speechless.
good,Worked at the corporate office for several years. Great place to work. Plenty of growth opportunities if you are willing to work hard. 401K matching program is great!
good,its alright. but its pretty good. for the most part I like it but I cant say I would ever enjoy working there again. maybe for more money. someday. haha
good,People you work with determine your experience at work. Worked at 2 different home depots each we different in terms of overall experience but the job was the same
good,"Good place to work"
good,"Generally work 10 to 12 hours a day. Very fast paced and must be able to multi task. As a general manager, you have to prioritize tasks for the team and the business day is very fluid."
good,This is one of the best jobs that I've had this far. I would recommend anyone to apply at Home Depot that's in school. They are very helpful when it comes to your schooling. Every job has it's bad apples but this is a good job.
good,"I loved my job at home depot, i was well liked by my co-workers,I was always on time,arrived early and stayed later for overtime if they needed me, It was a great enviroment to work in, i would do it all over again if there was a warehouse here."
good,I loved working with HD! I wished that it could've lasted longer but with a huge lack of pay advances I had to leave. It is an amazing place to work otherwise! I loved my co-workers to the point that I even consider some as family! Learning new things can be boring but getting out on the floor to learn is really fun.
good,"restocking, helping customers, watering and working with plants. The garden department was my haven. Very friendly management very understanding of severe personal issues affecting attendance and performance. Management always made sure you were safe over anything. Very fast paced but not too stressful."
good,I had a wonderful time working there. It was always something new to be learned and my peers were awesome people to work alongside. There was always recognition for doing a job well done.
good,"The overall company is great; supportive, lenient attendance policy, relaxed work environment. Customers tend to be rude, and expect you to make the impossible happen. Pay is better than most call centers, but expect higher pay from a thriving company, based on how much customer support does for the customers. Someone employed 6 months are somehow promoted before a 6 year employee. I understand one may perform better, but I think it's better to invest more training into someone who knows the company like the back of their hand. Compared to more training for someone who isn't very knowledgeable yet, and will likely need help in their new position."
good,"Great place to work! Always treated right and with respect! Fully recommend working here! Even though it’s warehouse work, you’ll see and feel the difference!!"
good,"learned how to cashier various items,the most enjoyable part of job was helping customer with their purchases,excellent workplace culture,hardest part of job ringing up some items"
good,"Spent a great time at Home depot, end up with having family not friends."
good,"Great place to work for. Great people to work with. Great management. Customers are caring and understanding, minor problem customers. Handled returns, was a head cashier.  Would love to go work for them again if the offer was right."
good,I enjoyed my employment very much at the Home Depot. Great management and co-workers. Just needed a job that provided healthcare for part time employees.
good,"Being a retail company, they always want you to work on weekends and holidays. This means no time for the employee to be with their families. No extra bonus was offered."
good,Enjoyed my employment at Home Depot. Learned a lot and was given access to improving my position as well as my benefits. Fair and equal work experience.
good,"I would sit down at a desk, log into my computer, turn on my headset and start taking calls. customers would ask me questions and I would answer them with respect no matter what the question was."
good,"Home Depot Is great, you have job promotions, you get a raise after the first six months, you get descent hours and you can request more hours If possible. Management Is awesome. Communicating with and helping out the customers will be the best part for me."
good,Home Depot is a company that makes you feel welcome and works around your schedule whenever they can.  Management tries to make it a fun environment by giving recognition awards and ensuring that you are properly trained to do your job.
good,You can advance within the company to a better position. You also get a 15mins break for the first 2hrs after clocking in and another 15mins after the 2hrs of your lunch break
good,it was a fun place to work if you enjoy customer service and construction/ home good sales. there is always something to do and it can be a fast paced work environment
good,"a regular workday at home depot would be more of an excitement because everyday its something different "
good,I enjoyed doing merchandising some fellow associate welcomed new employees others did not make it easy to learn …   in Hollywood store was experienced and saw me doing something wrong each time I asked her for help she ignored me another time she went  a supervisor and he didn't approve of what was done I was to ready labels and clean an area that was to be inspected most labels was dried out n falling off I reprinted all labels and began to ready section for proper inspection I was told to stop n only do minimum working for home depot merchandising team was great
good,"Was usually steady paced when doing receiving and freight"
good,Fun work environment and a lot of exercise. we are customer friendly. And we have events for the customers and associates. for customer appreciation. I loved it there
good,Excellent workplace for starting as a first job.   Excellent workplace as well as outstanding management.   On point managers and associates.   Kind and caring through every stressful day.
good,"Pays well once becoming salaried. Poor pay prior to that. Too much emphasis on veterans. You will get fed a lot assuming you enjoy junk food. Good advancent opportunities. More if you are female.  Hard work, willingness to learn is a must of trying to advance."
good,going into work brings a good feeling. most all the employees have a positive attitude. if a customer needs help and know one is around its so common to see an employee from another department jump in to assist.
good,"Everybody is nice and courteous with each other , lost are very communicative and inquired to learn new thin about others , it’s a very cool environment to work and to grow as an individual"
good,"I absolutely loved working at Home Depot but the hours that I was being scheduled did not work out with my busy lifestyle and I had to quit. Everyone there treats you like family and you’ll fit in really quickly. I was a lot associate and that was quite hard on my body also which was another reason that I quit. Overall, this is a wonderful place to work and I highly recommend it."
good,It was a fine place to work they just dont pay to make a living on so its hard but the people are great and they do care but the pay is low but its ok
good,"I enjoyed my time at THD, however I believe that the managers were under qualified and needed to improve. Because of this, I felt that there was no way to work up within the company. This was only for one department, so this does not apply to the company as a whole."
good,"Love the people, love the job.  Only wish that the pay was enough to survive on.  The company provides you with the training and support to help you on your job, where you never feel left out to dry.  Safety is really emphasized.  Management is approachable and available.  Possibly the best retail job I have ever worked."
good,"Overall, my experience with Home Depot has been a pleasant one. The company culture is solid, alongside pay and benefit options. At the local level, my management team has performed admirably, helping guide both the store and its workers without being overbearing. However, I have encountered two or three times where upper level management (above store manager) have seemed harsh on store management, and the result trickles down, leaving everyone temporarily bitter. Perhaps it is a good sign that the store employees feel bonded as one unit in this case, but it would be better if such issues did not arise at all."
good,it was a fun time working there the only problem i really had was with our manager. he would try and have us do jobs for other people in the store. he would never really answer question straight he would try and give riddles and run around questions.
good,Great workplace environment for retail. Managers are well meaning if not overly zealous at times when it comes to micromanaging. Policies are somewhat strict but not overbearing.
good,"Perfect job to manifest customer service skills, which I excelled in. I loved meeting new people & watching them smile as I epitomized exemplary customer service. The only disadvantage was the pay & opportunity for growth. The management exhibited genuine concern for both the employees as well as to customers. A typical day would go by so fast due to being so engrossed w/ making customers happy."
good,"I overall enjoy my job, would prefer a dressier dress code. But casual matches warehouse environment. I would recommend working here. Great for college students and high school students. No employee discount which is unfortunate."
good,Help families that is need either through the homer fund reimbursement a percentage to those who attend college. Also success sharing every 6 months which is a percentage of what the store makes.
good,Work was enjoyable.  Lots of customer interaction.  Employees work easy to get along with and management team was flexible with my doctors appointments at VA.
good,"Fun, fast paced and stressful at the same time.  I loved working here, but unfortunately when lay offs hit the department, there is no job security at all"
good,The crew is amazing and great way to learn about all sorts of products they sell. You get to make great connections with reoccurring customers and help out those that have never been there.
good,"I enjoy everything about working freight, and warehouse. Fast paced moving the carts and unloading the trucks, time manage how you fill merchandise and unload pallets. They have since redesigned the process, when I was working it was stressful and unbalanced."
good,"Great place to work. Like most companies in america today. It hard to get promoted. You have to be part of the in crowd. Also, the pay is too low. Great environment to work. Also, like most companies. They tend to have the managers in control."
good,Working at Home Depot is great. The only drawback is that they don't hire fulltime. Freight team is given everything they need to do their job effectively.
good,"Working for Wilshire Home Depot was a sound experience. It paid fairly, the people were nice and the only difficulties you'd find in there are the neighborhood surrounding it (bad area after all) and the occasional angry/crazy customer. "
good,"fast paced sales environment ."
good,Home Depot was a great place to work. Only reason I love is because it was scheduled me 4 hours a day. I had an open availability and they said they couldn't use it
good,"Nice place to work. Strong company. Employees worked together. "
good,"good first job "
good,"Working here was during one of the best summers of my life and a big contributor to this was Home Depot. It is a great Job for a young man or woman looking to work hard, lose some weight, and make good money."
good,It's a quick paced job depending on your department and the season. You never stop learning or getting on the job training which can be annoying since customers expect you to know everything in the store. Management varies. Culture of favoritism is rampant. Very political place.
good,"Very nice staff and management here. Benefits were also great. If you enjoy a flexible schedule, its the perfect place. I only left because of relocation."
good,"I enoyed working at home depot, but once I started to see the favorites and the polotics behind it, It kind of bummed me out. But most of the people were really nice and fun to be around. I really enjoyed the diversity."
good,Really fun and interactive job. Wish there was more training involved in the field aspect of things. Low stress. Only complaint would be the lack of compensation for gas and mileage on my personal vehicle.
good,"Working there as a contractor had its ups and downs,  they do train you but on the floor it is nothing like what the instructors taught you  in training. You do have breaks and you must succeed to get the best schedule or you will be stuck with something like 12:30PM to 9:00 PM off only on Tuesday and Wednesday which I hated but once you are an employee you can make up to $8.00 more. They are very nice and laid back, you can leave your purse in your cubicle but that is me. I never had an incident. I did learn a lot about trouble shooting PCs, management was listening to your needs and concerns. Culture was pretty laid back and respectful. The hardest part of the job if you are not computer savvy then that could hurt but like I stated they train you."
good,Great work environment.  Good marketing ideas.  Friendly and helpful to all customers.  Needed to make more money for my family to take care of them..
good,I enjoyed working there because they really reconize and reward hard workers . always chances for learning new tasks or product . alot of different product knowledge to learn and how to use but supper rewarding once you do .
good,during my time as an employee at Home depot I learned a wide range of skills that prepared me for a better future in the customer service field. all with a great compensation for  my hard work and dedication
good,The store offers great incentives to even a part time employee. With such a vast amount of home improvements there is always something to learn to help the customers and yourself.
good,Working at home depot was a great opportunity for me learning more about home improvement. The skills read wired are their beneficial for meAs a new homeowner I now know what to fix if broken.
good,"I enjoy home deopt, 9/10 would definently reccomend to a 16 year old kid looking for an easy job. The management is a okay, i wouldnt say that it is the best, because i have had better. but it works."
good,"Working for this company was a really great learning experience, the showed a lot of thing to help me save money on home improvements. They also had a really family orientated nature."
good,"Always plenty of wisdom floating around The Home Depot. Although the pay was not the greatest for the workload, the environment , anyone would thrive in. Genuine people at The Depot."
good,Good all around place to work. Surrounded by good hearted people everyone is willing to help. Everyday is always fun and you will always be learning something new.
good,The people are friendly and fun to work with. Everyone feels like a family and we try to help each other get through the day and stay on task as much as possible
good,Friendly place to work I've learned about different tools the management was fair and strict there's really no hard part to the job its pretty much simple . the most i enjoyed about home depot it was good work and you met great people
good,Home Depot is a great company to work for and their benefit package is fantastic. Depending on which area where your located changes in work environment. Management teams are never on the same page
good,"Being an associate of The Home Depot has most pro's than it does con's. Meaning The Home Depot provides great benefits to all their employees, provide exceptional and steady progress for career advancement and provides hours of sick time as needed."
good,"Fill orders for customers, learned about new home improvement techniques, management was helpful to their employees, hard to juggle work and home life, everyone was pleasant to work with"
good,"I enjoyed working here, I meet a lot of people while providing service of all walks of life. The managers were all nasty but all my co workers were like family."
good,When I was working there the coworkers were really supportive and they also had a homerfund that would help associates in need. There is room for growth.
good,I learned alot about tools and home improvement. To another it may not be alot but to me I was able to take alot of things with me and also learned to fix stuff.
good,"If you need a company to start your career in, The Home Depot is a wonderful place to do. From hire, my managers communicated to me that if I wanted to advance my career they would help me every step of the way and they did exactly that. It was unfortunate that the commute became too much for me but I'd go right back if I moved closer. On top of that we were like a family. We gave back to the community and they fed us any chance they could get!"
good,"interact, instruct and sell needed products to customers. computerized continuous learning about work and products. hardest part of job is knowing that you can't fix stupid customers."
good,Great place to work if you are a student or retire Call Center customer service team leader and onboarding employee trainer Call Center customer servi
good,Management demands so much within very little time. Even though they refer to everyone as family or a team you are on your own co workers are amazing.
good,Everyone is goal oriented at home depot and customer service is a must. The stores can be very busy at times and workload is usually constant. Most people working there are positive and friendly. Going above and beyond to satisfy the customer is celebrated at Home Depot.
good,"the interview process was awesome. The interviewer was very nice but straight to the point. he told me what was to be expected, how long the shifts are going to be and it would be a very fast paced job."
good,I enjoyed my job here and would have stayed if I had not moved cities. The job was fast paced but I always had a team to rely on when nights got rough.
good,"the dependable hard workers dont advance or get recognized. the benefits are great however, the workload dont match the pay. this is a great starter job and it also is a good secondary job."
good,Nice place to work for. It is very flexible with job schedules if you attend school. Very easy to move departments and learn new things. Coworkers are awesome
good,I enjoyed working at home depot. I learned a lot and the tem members were very respectful. working at home depot have it's ups and downs but overall great environment
good,"The co workers, and even management was alright, is alright, the only problem was the customers they are not at all pacient, and expect you(the associate) to know everything but yet everything else is okay."
good,"Very fast paced, someone always available to help ensure you do a good job. Plenty of training to do so that you're knowledgeable in your field. The managers will be a pain at times, but mostly nice"
good,100 inbound/outbound calls daily providing excellent customer service. accurately collecting information on space and condition of the water heater. Provide an estimate for water heater installation. hard sales and rebuttals. Best part of the job was that it was team oriented and there were always contest to win money and hardest part was securing the sale through rebuttals
good,"Learning the process of the business and on hand how to. Over time a developed programs to improve the process of payables and receivables department. Then moved on to imports, claims and just kept going to help other departments. Was promoted to associate lead in my department and began development/training seminars for new/current employees. This was a very fulfilling job, as the company grew, so do I. "
good,"Just laid back, people being angry about being charged a late fee when they are 3 hours late. Tool rental associates are not supposed to mark down rentals."
good,"Easy job but lots of pressure to sign up customer for credit cards. The easy going atmosphere with employees and customers. The only thing I didn't like, as a part timer I didn't qualify for any benefits."
good,It was great I would definitely work there again. The only problem I had was that they kept taking my hours away even though I worked extremely hard. The night crew seems more better.
good,"I was stationed in the tool rental section of Home Depot."
good,"It was cool, not too bad, it held me down for a long time and met some great people there, so i really have nothing bad to say. Overall a good experience, I'd recommend this job to someone easily."
good,There was always something new to learn at this company.  From garden department to lumbar and every department in between.  There were always new and interesting people to meet and work with.
good,The Home Depot is a great place to learn about home improvement and sales. Over the past 10 years - I've learned pretty much everything on how to improve my home's interior with expert knowledge.
good,"Good Company to work for. Coworkers were always friendly and fun."
good,"While this was a fast-paced environment, and sometimes stressful, it was so enjoyable!!!  Learning all aspects of the business was most invigorating, and teaching and training others was rewarding."
good,"home depot is a good company,, it takes good care of people, but in my case, i want to apply my degree and for some reasons its better to look for some opportunities  on some other companies."
good,"my managers were really nice they were awesome. they recognize our hard work and are always there to help you with a smile. you get discounts in some stores, you get to learn how to treat people, how to give exellent customer service. you grow to learn how to make decisions. i really love working here."
good,"Home Depot is currently in a stagnant phase, closing stores and laying off many to save money while they are unable to compete with Amazon, Harbor Freight, Lowes, Walmart or anyone else, really. They recently changed their return and reward program policies across the board, and increased their prices on a lot of things, and discontinuing products that made them unique, meaning they may be going the way of K-Mart and Sears in the coming decade."
good,"I worked there as a second job to make some holiday money but it got to be to much while working a full time job also."
good,"I was a fast pace of work I did. They need more associates."
good,The company workplace is great! Very flexible for students to work and study. The employees and managers are great! Everything I've learned will come in handy.
good,I love Home Depot and still do today!  It was a great experience with an amazing CEO running the company.  The culture was all about Customer Service and taking care of the customer while taking care of the employees.  I would recommend this as a great job for someone fresh out school or 2 year business degree.
good,Good place to work. Management is good and able to meet employees needs. Advancement opportunities within the Home Depot company. Able to move around.
good,"Love new challenges everyday.  Always thinking on the fly, solving problems and working to deliver the needs of the customer and/or business.  Strategic thinking, persuasive and responsible leadership, great relationship building and communication skills.  Developing strategies for success, building tools and processes."
good,"it was great! I would do it again. short days, smooth, easy going, nice management team members, flexible schedules, close to minimum wage (only negative)"
good,Myself I enjoyed working at home depot it was relaxed and calming. when I worked there the store people I worked with felt like a family and would help me out if I needed it.
good,The company is nice but the store it self needs more structure and discipline. Management seems to scared to fire or write someone up if well deserved.
good,This company opened the door for me to return the work force. They are well structured with many avenues to pursue if you wish to advance your existing skills or to learn new ones is you are able to be flexible to their requirements. They have great benefits with the ability to change them if your life changes. They have many flexible shifts to accommodate a number of lifestyles and disabilities. There is a great inclusive work environment where everyone tries to support each other.
good,"a typical day at work included many other associates in the store, teamwork, and daily goals/tasks.  Management, for the most part, was always available and willing to work with you on any problems.  the hardest part about the job was communication with other associates and maintaining job title, and doing things that were out of my job title.  the most enjoyable was having lots of friends to make and the diversity of associates."
good,"Great place to work, positive environment, right amount of training for every season. hardest part of the job is not being able to help more than one customer because of short staff."
good,this is by far the best place I have ever worked if I had it to do over again I would stay at Home Depot for the rest of my days. excellent job. Excellent pay and a well established company..
good,I absolutely enjoyed working along side friendly and outgoing people. They made tough work days go by faster and gave me very good security. I would recommend this job to anyone!
good,This was honestly one of the best jobs i can say i had while i was in the area. The management was very nice the job pace and coworkers were easy to get along with as well.
good,fun working environment. most customers are nice but you'll once in awhile get a rude customer. our managers are always their to listen and help out when needed
good,"Although I cannot see myself advancing my career here, working here was a great experience and the job culture was phenomenal. Everyone seemed as if they enjoyed working here and the customer-associate relationship was extremely professional."
good,The Home Depot instills VERY HIGH values in employee customer service. Many programs that benefit the community and the associates. A wheel of values is printed on every orange apron.
good,"Working at home depot is actually a very secure job; it has alot of advancement opportunities; if you're willing to put time and effort in. I was starting college when I worked here, and I would most definitely go back because they offer health,dental, and vision benefits, stock option, and 401 k plan! That's hard to find these days."
good,"home depot is a fast paste environment. staff are nice and respectful.the management are very helpful and understanding. there is no hardest part, just learning and giving it your all."
good,Cashiering for The Home Depot is a very relaxed position. It can be a little boring during slow times but for active during peak times. Staff is friendly.
good,Love working here. Great people: great place to where you can move up in. Management are great and leave to help people grow. They also have good benefits
good,"Working at The Home Depot really allows you to get to know your customers because many of them are regulars. Although you are standing most of the time, time flies by if you are productive and helping customers and keeping the store at its best. Working here teaches you a lot about tools and appliances and hardware. You also learn many things from the customers who come in. It is a great environment where employees of all ages will enjoy!"
good,"Nice job.  People are friendly, managers are usually easy to get along with.  Directions are clear and easy to follow.  As long as you do your job you will have no issues here.  I actually miss this job."
good,i enjoyed my time there. i am looking for full time job but i still want to keep my job there. wonderful management and coworkers. its a place i would recommend.
good,"The empowerment process that the management team employs allows the employees to grasp the idea of ""owning the business"" by being able to make some decisions on their own. It is clear what each employee is accountable for."
good,Home Depot was face paced and never boring. You are able to move up in the company if you wanted to and they offer all the training needed. Pay is fair and the company itself is great.
good,"There is a lot of driving time and many hours spent talking to customers. The job is great and the training is exceptional. Management put in extensive hours ensuring their employees are prepared to sell their products. Working on 100 percent commission is hard, until you establish yourself with many sales. I enjoyed meeting customers and finding the right product for their homes that will make their lives more enjoyable."
good,"Great job, decent pay. I would have stayed except I worked graveyards and wanted to go to school. I worked freight crew, unloaded trucks, stocked shelves and maintained the seasonal and patio area."
good,I loved working as an HR Manager for The Home Depot.  I loved the culture and all the things The Home Depot allowed us to do for employees as well as the community.  When The Home Depot downsized and eliminated all HR Mangers in the stores I was devastated.  I loved this job.
good,A typical day at work consists of a morning meeting then going to general service which entails detail on integrity of the bays we service and any projects we may receive in the day or weeks time. I learned a lot about managing my time and attention to detail as MET associates work mainly for the vendors. Management changed hands recently and has gotten better with customer responses and it is a very inclusive company. The hardest part of being a Merchandising Execution Associate is the constant change of policy and regulations. you never know when they will happen and what is correct and not correct at first. The most enjoyable part of the job is in my opinion the hours. MEA's work 5a-1:30p or 6a-2:30p which allows time for us to do anything else we need to within the rest of the days time
good,I loved working at home depot. My day was mostly working cash register and helping customers. I also put up merchandise at the end of the day and occasionally completed new training sessions.
good,The garden dept was the most fun.  It was hard work and very busy but we worked together well.  My only complaint was that the pay was low considering how hard we worked.
good,"managed the installations of outside home improvement projects. managed 9 install mangers in the state. long ours,  handled customer's complaints. on call all the time. I retired from HD in November and I m looking for a part time job but will consider full time for the right job."
good,Great place to work fun people. Management was amazing loved the company an wat it stands for. Great start for young professional to grow an reach goals.
good,"I started working at The Home Depot to jump start my work experience. After a short time as a cashier, I moved up to inventorying management which allowed me to better understand logistics in product placement. I have learned how to track items along with timeframes for products to be received and stocked. Management was very helpful, with guidance along the way, they were able to teach me everything I have learned from managing product orders to communicating to my team as a manager. The most enjoyable part of working at The Home Depot was developing my skillset as a leader, this made my transition into the military more natural."
good,"The job is fast paced and they want you to learn about all departments. They promote their credit card, and you are expected to solicit customers to apply for one. I sold appliances but initially asked to work in the customer service area or the office, but was declined."
good,It's in our culture to take care of our customers everyday. We work everyday to maximize our sales and profits and will do anything to ensure our customers continue to shop The Home Depot.
good,On a typical day at work we would come in head to receiving dock and get our jobs for the day. Some days we had a truck and some days we wouldn't. We always stocked shelves or cleaned the overhead. I learned to not let supervisors or managers control your happiness. You have to go into work with a mindset to come do your job and handle your business. The workplace culture was awesome and i met a lot of great people. There was no hard part about the job and best part of the job was being able to make decent pay for a couple of hours out of the day.
good,Great place to work. The company gives you multiple opportunities for upward mobility. The hours are extremely flexible. The relationships built here will really have a great impact on you.
good,"You are kept busy pretty much 100% of the time, but it makes the time go by and you are not rushed to complete tasks.  Fun place to work, outstanding benefits."
good,Great Place to work great employees and a fun atmosphere .the management was very fair and made it a fun job every day.the hardest part of the job was dealing with some customers attitude you can't satisfy everyone. the most fun part of the job was doing Showcase Events.we met some really great people.
good,Good place to work. Nice people. customer comes first but to a limit. Nice management. But no room for advancement unless you stay for years and years. starting pay is higher than minimum wage
good,"Always something new to learn. Whether it's a new skill like operating machinery, or learning the products of the store and how to apply them. Always a friendly environment with the co workers. Everyone helps and respects one another."
good,"To many, Home Depot is just a job. For others it could be so much more. The opportunity for advancement is there if you really wish to grow with the company. The structure that Home Depot provided in the day to day is something I still miss to this day. Although they do provide complete benefits, unfortunately I had to part ways with Home Depot due to salary. I would honestly work for Home Depot again given the salary I need to maintain a household."
good,"Everyday here was a new journey! Great people, realistic goal and wonderful customers made this an easy job to go to every day! I worked with great people who turned into my family away from home!"
good,Good start for the beginners as it provides perfect work exposure and environment. The company gives everyone their workspace and flexibility to share their thoughts with management.
good,Great benefits and work environment. My experience in 2 different stores was that management seems preoccupied with upper management corporate relationships and there is a ho-hum attitude towards what happens on the sales floor.
good,"The employees at the Home Depot were, for the most part, really kind and welcoming. There were many people there to assist with any questions that needed to be asked during training, and while actually on the job. Manager could've been friendlier, but overall, he was pretty great as well."
good,"Engage in customer service. Selling products to customers in a warehouse environment.  I have learned management skills, problem solving skills, workplace culture and how to improve daily success through associate engagement.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interaction with leadership team, store associates, and peers."
good,I loved doing my job as an Asset Protection Specialist just didn't agree with getting wrongfully terminated! but I have been settled out and I am grateful for the experience and chance giving.
good,They are constantly trying to improve your skills in every department for the store but in my case I won the Cashier Olympics after 4 months of employment with no promotion and they wouldn't allow me to acquire new skills.
good,"learned a lot about customers, retail, and got the opportunity to learn how to drive a forklift. Just worked part time but had a great time working there."
good,"The Home Depot is known for providing great customer service, but it is also known for treating its employees fairly. I worked with a great staff and the job culture was comfortable. It is a lot of physical work, but pays off in the end."
good,The Home Depot is well run company. I believe they provide you all the assistance you like to get as far as you like to advance. the fellow employees arer very nice and welcome new comers as family.
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work, with a fair starting wage and friendly coworkers. The management is attentive and willing to help the employees."
good,"I loved working for Home Depot! LOVEDDD it! But somehow, when I graduated college and moved from Savannah, GA to Atlanta, GA, they did not transfer my job, even though I gave them a month notice! I wrote corporate, but never got a response. I really expected more from this ""great"" company."
good,"A typical day as a cashier was just going to your register on time, greeting all customers warmly and ask if they need any help looking for something. there's rarely ever any HUGE problems but when there are problems, everyone works together to solve them. Its very simple if you can count and press the appropriate buttons. not a hard job at all. the only thing that i didn't like about working at my particular location was that management wasn't very friendly majority of the time. it was hard to talk to them about stuff because they seemed too busy or like they didn't really care. also, i would watch other people move around into other positions, but i never could. i had an open schedule and eventually i was willing to move to any department, but they never gave me the chance while others were moving around. it was really unfair, but overall the job is easy and HOME DEPOT ITSELF AS A COMPANY IS A WONDERFUL COMPANY"
good,"great job great employer, only reason im not working there today is because i have developed shift sleep disorder and got unluckly scheduled at 5:45 a lot during my probation period and was late 4 times before i passed 90 days. its a shame management did feel the need to try and keep me because my direct manager and coworkers were all very happy with my performance and i loved the job. but corporate rules are corporate rules i guess"
good,"In a nutshell, depending on the type of manager on duty, your day could be wither incredible or subpar. I've had a wonderful time working with my coworkers in the Tool Rental Department and I consider the interaction between customers and associates to be the most fulfilling part of the job. Personally, I find motivation wherever I am and Home Depot is no exception. Whether its a simple request to locate a product or some advice on home repair I try my hardest to assist each and every customer. Learning from the tool rental technician is also an incredible benefit to working there."
good,"It's a very good company to work for, working there has helped me do a lot for my family! I have stocks and 401k with the Home Depot! I was able to buy my hse through the Home Depot"
good,"I enjoyed going to this job the atmosphere was very welcoming from the front door to my desk, the work load could get a little heavy toward invoice day and the day after but other than that I was pleased"
good,"Welcomes customers by greeting them; offering them assistance"
good,I learned a lot working for home depot. A great place to work needs a little finetuning on sick andpersonal day occurances though. My experiences are dont get sick within your 90 days
good,"Very good place to start learning more about hardware, being able to learn new programs, very clean, very friendly workers, learned how to do book keeping, management is fair but not very good when coming to promoting people, different cultures"
good,"una empresa en la que aprendes a desarrollar aptitudes que tienes, lo único malo es que algunos líderes no tienen buen trato con sus asociados y son prepotentes, pero en general es una magnífica empresa, con apoyo para los asociados, vales de despensa, caja de ahorro, me siento muy feliz de haber laborado con la gran familia de sangre naranja y si pudiera volver lo haría sin dudarlo. Muchas gracias Home Depot!!!"
good,"I enjoyed working at the Home Depot Customer Service Center.  The Management was very professional.  I enjoyed my Training and Working side-by-side with My Colleagues.

good,"Great opportunity to move up in the company. Once offered.  Like any company there is always room for improvement. "
good,"At the time I worked at The Home Depot, I was just someone that would retrieve shopping carts and assist customer with questions or loading of product. It was a good atmosphere to work in and I would recommend it to anyone seeking employment."
good,"Home Depot can be a rewarding management career.  It is an intense environment requiring multi-tasking, financial knowledge and customer service skills.  Career advancement is not as readily available as one would imagine past the level of Assistant Store Manager.  Home Depot is an aggressive retailer currently dominating the industry of home improvement."
good,Extremely difficult position as a Manager as the time investment requirement is usually 60+ Hours. It is very rewarding and your compensated very well. You are given the opportunity to be a business owner and make decisions best suited for your segment or location.

good,The home Depot is a great place to work for. I would never have left but most employees are part time and the pay is not great. but the employees and atmosphere are amazing.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at the Home Depot. Team Members were super friendly,  A lot of the jobs are very physical, but the team always tried to keep things light and fun."
good,Good friends but work you to death but over all the supervisors and key holders do try to have a good report with employees did enjoy the garden department in helping with the plants
good,"My time in the stores was vastly more satisfying than my time in district support. If you decide to work here, stay in a store. As a support member, it was hard to get buy in from district leadership and higher to hold in-store personnel accountable for their actions if they didn't personally witness the shortcomings. As in many  companies, some leaders have their favorites who can do no wrong. When trying to point out that these people were not all they were cracked up to be I jeopardized my career and had to toe the line and pretend they were doing everything they were supposed to."
good,"I enjoy being outdoors and helping customers . I enjoy the sales aspect by  providing my expertise to help the customers "
good,Managers friend's move up the ladder in the organization. You can win the best employee but you won't even consider to move up the ladder. Learn to deal with different characters
good,"Great company,  great people. Just takes awhile to advance. There's really not much else to say about the company. But I will say that i would work there again."
good,"A great work environment and great management, but it's hard to want to work there after a time with other opportunities available. The Christmas parties are fun too."

Customer service is something I take pride in while working with so many customers and helping them in all ways i can, from locating an item to perfecting an order for their project."
good,Complete daily objectives throughout the day while providing full service to customers in the paint department. what i learned was how to multitask and deal with customer whom may be frustrated. very friendly work conditions young culture. hardest part of the job was being the only attendant while wanting to complete your daily objectives in a timely manner. most enjoyable part of the job was there were no limits to how far you can go and the great feeling of accomplishing assignments as well as getting positive feedback from customers
good,"Even with a crazy day and dealing with alot of different customers and staff, for some reason you just get thru it with the help of everyone else.  For some reason it just works."
good,"Great place to work as a second job, in school or to keep busy. Training is easy, not all hard. Friendly environment to meet new people. Schedules are flexible and there's options for development and growth with the company. Benefits are awesome and well as a 401k and stock purchase plan"
good,This is a good company to work for so far. Everyone seems to get along and is happy to work there. The management seems very engaged with the staff as well
good,I Learned that more women come here than men. That was very interesting that I discussed with my colleagues. Its a calm work place that i enjoy working at.
good,Great Place to work. Wonderful employees. Great ASM's. They take care of the employees and though party's ever holiday. Also the ASM's we back you if a customer is being disrespectful.
good,"Worked in the paint department, facing items, stocking and helping customers. Great place to work and very friendly staff. Would always be pulled in different areas and only seemed to be running on a skeleton crew. Didn't make a lot of money but had potential to move up the ladder had I stayed longer."
good,"I would go back, the only problem is the pay was not the greatest.  I loved the e people I worked with and the atmosphere was great."
good,"The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest. Even as a normal departmental associate, there is always something to be doing."
good,This is a great company to work for. You can really tell that the care for their employees. They respect personalities and different cultures. They also push you to success by training and hiring with in the company.

good,"Work hard and stay honest you can move up quickly."
good,"typical day is unloading trucks, sort freight per department. Stock shelves assist customers. Friendly coworkers and managers."
good,"Not every day or every aspect was perfect here but overall, it was a great place to work. Lots of employee support, the Store Manager knew everyone's name. Some days the staff was too thin and we had a tough time covering all the departments adequately but they generally noticed if you did a good job under a challenge. Room to move between departments to increase your knowledge and experience. The new employees who didn't want to work hard or otherwise didn't fit in pretty much weeded themselves out. It was possible to move up, but not very quickly in this store - good associates and not much turnover. First-class technology. Associates were always encouraged to do more than the customer expected."
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work.  There is a great culture and the people there are great to work with on a daily basis.  The culture is great because they believe in the value wheel which includes such things as entrepanural spirit, doing the right thing, and building shareholder value."
good,You are always on the go helping out all customers internal and the ones that come through the door. you learn a lot about people Management is great can be a fun place to work getting the training done is the hardest part of the day most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers fix there problem's
good,One of the best corporations to work for. Great compensation and benefits. Would definitely work for this company again. The Home Depot takes very good care of their associates.
good,This job was very active and I enjoyed the challenges. I'd  loved to still work with the company and hope to soon join again. Awesome job and recommend it to all
good,"I love my job. I haven't been able to say that in a long time. As with most jobs there are good and bad things, I find that the good ones out weigh the bad by a great deal."
good,"Customer Service, Sales, friendly and teamwork environment, every day a different challenge is the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,Working with this electrical apprentice company was great good people to have on your team. Plenty of overtime until the company moved and merged with another company.
good,From helping customers to stocking shelves you are always busy. It is a team based environment so youll learn about other departments aswell.

good,A great place to work. I had enjoyed working here. I had learned great customer skills. There Is how ever job drama as always here especially the cashiers. Overall great place to work.
good,"Supervisors were very professional and friendly.  Everything was first-rate.  The wages could have been better, but co-workers were friendly and would assist and teach the new staffers.  Management was very flexible with schedules and team morale was always being stressed."

good,This was one of my favorite places to work. I found that the culture was like none other. The management would work with you on any schedule or possible conflict. The job over all was the right fit for anyone starting there career off.
good,"A typical day here at The Home Depot, I come in and get my  assignments from my supervisor and lead our Daily Streches. I have learned a lot about Merchandising. I learned how to read Planograms, Drive the Electic Forklift, and help the Supervisor out when he is out of the building. The management here is awesome, they help you out with anything you ask. They will teach you a lot."
good,"If you are interested in working for a place where customer service is the number 1 priority, look no further than The Home Depot. They strive to be the number 1 customer service retailer in the world."
good,Absolutely loved working for Home Depot! Definitely a family oriented job place.  Would go back there immediately if their pay scale was even close to what I make as coder.
good,"I enjoy working with the customers & co-workers.  As a front end cashier it's face pace! I work throughout the front end at various positions, returns, pro-cashier, & self checkout!! I assist the service desk as well, answering the phones, releasing orders, & assisting customers with various issues!! I opened over 300 credits from 12/2014 to present.  The store manager acknowledges my excellent customer service & other various dept. Heads.  Hardest part of job is trying to make younger employees respect experience of older employees"
good,"Good Opportunity, great coworkers. Works with hours. If you like customer service work in the day. If you like working alone work the night shift ."
good,"driving sales is important and customer service skills are required, very flexible with schedules and family friendly"

good,Learned more at THD about how to manage a business than any business school could ever teach me. They pride themselves on internal promotion and advancement! THD does an outstanding job at training and developing from  one day on the job! Great place to build wealth!
good,"I learned a lot working for this company, both in business and customer service. I had a lot of knowledge of plants and there care and about educating people toward a greener life, and the Home Depot taught me the business aspects of managing money, people and inventory. I would still work there but after finishing my degree my husband and I decided to start a family and work from home."
good,If you possess a good work ethic then the Home Depot is a great place to work. My coworkers are good and the management is awesome. Don't get me wrong. It is work. If you aren't ready to work hard then go find a desk job or work at a department store.
good,"Morning pack down they are a very important aspect of the store. There are many responsibilities of - pulling stock down, putting incoming stock in, checking for missing product to be reordered."
good,"My co-workers were amazing! A typical day at work would depend on your position, I would check messages and forward to appropriate person, complete installation folders, assistant anyone that needed help with over flow."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers beyond their needs and going out of the way to find the product they need for the job that they're about to tackle whether it'd be for home purpose or work purpose.
good,"work. a typical work day for a cashier is dealing with customers handing returns exchanges, store credit etc.. keeping the work area tidy. You never stay in one spot sometimes you're at returns sometimes you're by the pro desk and sometimes you're in the garden. The co- workers are so sweet they are all like a big family and the cashier leads are very understanding. The hardest part of the job is definitely returns customers tend to have less patience and the returns desk has more responsibilities and it can be a bit cluttered if not cared for properly. The best part of the job is working with amazing people and meeting new people as the customers roll in."
good,"The home depot is a great place to learn and work.  The Management is fair and helpful, encouraging even. I would rate them top notch. The training is on computer and intense."
good,well a typical day for me is going in cleaing bathrooms making sure all class rooms have what they need as far as supplys and hand sanitiers extc. I learned how to more hands on skills as far as pluming and minor construction goes . I also learned the love that each kid has for me as well as the staff .as far as mangment they were nice always made sure I had something to do hands on.the staff loved me always moving things around for them always willing to go above and beyond for them . the hardest part was none because I loved working with kids and passing them there lunch see there smiles. I love working with kids in school and out as I have a few of my own im great humble cool guy and I love that my coworkers loved tha about me.
good,"great work environment, and have learned a lot since i first started there, didn't know a single thing about home depot and how to build or create projects but after working there for more than two years i have grasped so much knowledge almost know everything, management was well better than most. However store was very short staffed. Co-workers were the best very friendly and fun to be around, hardest part of the job was trying to find a spotter and getting management support. The most enjoyable part of my job is communicating with the co-workers made the job time go by easier."
good,It.net was a great to work. Lots of wonderful Homers who share the knowledge.  DS create can do attitude. Store Manager knows your strengths and will utilize them.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job  was seeing a lot of people and talking to them. My co-workers were very nice and I had a good time with them.Also the management was excellent .
good,"co-workers are nice and respectful, i learned how to handle and satisfy customer needs. the management is unfair to certain employee's but most time its just another day at work"
good,"Fast paced, heavy customer interactions, need to be able to think on your feet or have the computer skills to search out the products that the customer is wanting."
good,"A day at the Home Depot is very productive. We are challenged everyday to go above and beyond for our customers. My co-workers and I love to work together to make our customers feel the need to come see us again. The hardest part of the job is to calm down a very irritated customer, however over the years it became easier and easier. I love to see the smiles of customers who came in confused not knowing what they were looking for and ended up getting everything they needed."
good,"Seeking career, and financial enhancement for me and my family.  Home Depot has given me great knowledge and experience needed to better my status."
good,"Need more, associates in departments but overall great workplace some awesome employees some employees need more training in certain areas excellent management"
good,Loved working at The Home Depot for more than 20 years. This company has really grown and stick behind true customer service! The leadership investment made in their associates are above compare to any other place I have ever worked.
good,"While there is no room for advancement unless you have lots of experience or plan to work there for a while, it's still an excellent company to work for. Pay is really great seeing as how you need no educational experience and no previous retail experience. I worked part time as a cashier and started out making $9 an hour, and was raised to $10 in less than 6 months. I often received bonuses and small gifts for being a good worker. I loved working for this company and I only left because I was in search of full time work and they had cut full time positions drastically because of the health care benefits requirements in the United States."
good,"Working at Home Depot I learned a lot. Certified on all equipment. Receiving product in and shipping to the stores was interesting to me. Working with different people on a daily basis. Travel, I loved."
good,As a Home Depot Merchandiser I enjoy my hours as well as the job itself. Working 5am-1:30pm not only gets me out earlier than most schedules but I get to learn most aspects of being a merchandiser.
good,"over worked and underpaid "
good,Great company with great people! Fast paced environment and always room for growth. The vast amount of positions and schedules can be beneficial.
good,My typical day was to assist customers with all their construction needs. I was able to work in any department the customers needed. Once I engaged a customer I went from my department to anywhere the customer needed. My home department was plumbing and quite often I ended up in appliances because of their need's. The most enjoyable part of my job here was the challenge of problem solving for the customer.
good,working at night you have more to your self with less management on you at all times co-workers are great hardest part everthing most enjoyable part nothing
good,"Enjoyable place to work, nice people. I just worked part time in the hardware department. I have no complaints"
good,"A day of work at The Home Depot is always a challenge because you don't know what to expect from customer.(Questions and problems to solve) You learn something new every day from the customers and also from a different department in the store. The management is always there for you to answer any question or problem that you are not able to solve. The co-workers are always going to be your second family, you will get use to them plus the are all fun to work with. The hardest part of my job is telling a customer that I don't know what product are the looking for or that I don't have or I don't carry the product they looking for. The most enjoyable part is driving the lift trucks, bunch on fun on the machines."
good,"The Home Depot is an amazing company which thrives on ensuring that the employees are taken care of. They strive to be the number one customer service retailer in the world and mean to do this by ensuring the people who assist customers are happy and content with the job at hand. The goal is stated at the top of the company by saying: ""Take care of your people, they will take care of the customers, and everything else will take care of itself."" You learn to build teams to succeed and to manage sales, margins, and inventory on a daily basis to ultimately be a profitable department and company. They teach you how to provide amazing customer service to every customer who walks in the door no matter the situation."
good,the staff at the home depot are great the management not so much it can be a fun place to work but the incentives arent all that great
good,"I would come in, break down the freight and then begin to take the merchandise to its designated area of the store. Management was not very good, there was a lack of communication. I mostly stocked in the paint section so i learned quite a bit about paints. The thing i enjoyed most about my job was being able to interact with the customers."
good,It was a great job - but you can not make enough money at the low % pay scale for out side sales of windows - doors & siding. 5 days of work each week. I really like Home Depot.
good,"I loved my coworkers here and my manager was to this day hands down the best I've ever had. Great work environment, decent pay, and a very flexible schedule. The only reason I left was because full time wasn't available in the 2 years I worked there."
good,"Its a good work place. I learned to place orders for customers. Learn how to work with my teammates to meet several goals. My management was good it could have been better. My co-workers were great we would help one another. Hardest part of the job was learning the computer system. The most enjoyable part was helping customers and putting a smile on their faces, also trying to make profit to the company."
good,Great co workers once I started I was treated as a member of  a family not just a co worker they are all ways their to help and encourage you. wonderful long term  benefits and they offer part time   benefits as well only down side is no in store discount
good,when my shift begin I would do a walk through to see if any product was on sale or discount then I would prepare my area by sweeping and watering plants and assisting customers.
good,I had a great time working at Home Depot I could have got paid better but overall it was awesome. I worked as a lot associate. I was able to work with other employees and customers on orders.
good,"i learned a lot about every department, I really enjoyed appliances and didn't mind dealing with upset customers. the hardest part of the job is when we had no coverage and dealing with stupid drama"
good,"Great job, working enviorment for a college student looking for part time or full time. There benefits are hands down great, however it does vary in what store and place you work in. Some stores as in Home Depots are different than others, meaning that you might or might not hate your location. Due to bad communication with MOD, Manager on Duty."
good,Smiling and greeting customers as they enter our store. Helping and assisting them finding merchandise. Managing money transactions at the cash register.
good,"Los días son muy parecidos, todo  en orden, cuidando la limpieza, muy formal, horarios establecidos y mucho respeto entre compañeros."
good,Great place to work. Great team of associates.  Hours change every week. Good training programs. A very good place to work if you do not need full time.
good,"In November of 2015, I started my job as M.E.T (Merchandising Execution Team), I was very unprepared for the physical aspect of the job. Being a part of the M.E.T team, we are required to down stock from the overhead inventory, which often means large or heavy boxes and equipment. That being said, there is always a fellow employee willing to help in these situations. My training that I received when I started was excellent. I have never been trained by someone so good at their job, or someone so knowledgeable and helpful. A typical day at work consists of being to work at 5am, having our morning meeting and knowing where to start servicing our products. As M.E.T, we also do what is known as ""resetting a bay"", which is where we remove old products and place new and upcoming products or brands into the shelves. As a group, our job consists of keeping product stocked, making sure price labels are correct and the right size, and every product label faces front. The most enjoyable aspect of my job, is that I am constantly learning or doing something new."
good,"Working in The Tool Rental Department at The Home Depot was a very challenging job. Product knowledge on over 500 tools and equipment gave me the confidence to establish a rapport with new ""weekend "" customers and daily customers such as Contractors.Management provided me with the freedom to make quick decisions on my own."
good,"I loved me job and the store loved me, them I got sick and was unable to come back to the store for work."
good,This job is great for having exceptional work environment and enjoyable employees while still being able to exert professionalism and extreme care for their employees. Hours could be better.
good,"Amazing company to work for , I worked there for over 3 years just be careful when having personal conversations on the clock and outside of work"
good,I loved working with the customers but the only down fall of me working there was that I got stalked by a paid booth guy and I told management I felt uncomfortable and they didn't handle it at all. so I put my 2wks notice in.
good,The Home Depot provides an equal opportunity for advancement for each associate. It is also a very friendly and family orientated work place. Focus is placed on good associate values
good,I would recommend The Home Depot for anyone who would like to grow as a leader and has a passion for customer service.  Be prepared for long hours and hard-driving days.
good,You'll be hired part-time. Only a few set schedule positions. If your part time you'll be on notice. Asset Protection advancement is a trickle but management positions on the sales floor are available from supervisor to manager.
good,"The Home Depot is a great company to work for.  It has benefit ackages, 401 K plans, stock packages and medical benefits.  Bonus payouts twice a year, and allows you to move around and grow with the company.  They also teach you, provide the training for every position in the company."
good,"Typical day at The Home Depot is always "
good,"The Home Depot organization as a whole is a great company to work for. Great opportunity for advancement and promotions; Although, the Home Depot I work for the management is really unprofessional and rude. I've worked there for some time and have never been updated on what I'm doing correct or incorrectly. Co-workers are like family but management is absolutely horrible. Job duty requirements are reasonable for pay. They could pay a little more, considering that you not only do your job but others as well. It can be really fun learning new things if the pay reflected the workload. Benefits and bonuses are great. A typical day is non-stressful, relaxed, and eventful. Most enjoyable part of the day is the customers. Especially  the regular customer who know you."
good,Being apart of the home depot was a big part of my life it was challenging at first then it became the love of my life i couldn't imagine my life without my job at home depot because they was there for me through the hardest times associates on the other hand are very difficult because they all go on hearsay and call HR services for no reason at all at the end it was like walking on pins and needles because i just didn't know which way they was coming next i say that because i broke a nail and they made a incident report i was like really wow i was with this company over 2 years the hardest part of my job was knowing i had to walk away and tell my kids that was heartbreaking they walked me out like i was a criminal in which i lost my job over a lie associate called and stated i said he was more she than he in which thats not what was said i said i wish i could just walk around home depot and not have so a large work load  he didn't want to get his hands dirty but any who the most enjoyable part of my job was my customers i looked forward to seeing them because a lot would call to see if i was there before they actually come out because i gave them my undivided attention and helped them with all of their needs
good,"I volunteered Home Depot through this class at my high school and I thought working there was great, all of the employees were really helpful and great to work with."
good,"Good steady job that kept you on your toes.  Difficult for advancement.  Worked closely with a lot of other departments."
good,"I learned how to manage my time and also correspond with my co-workers, about their daily job duties. plus the job enabled the opertunity to perform other duties, like working the walk way and directing pedestrians"
good,"prepare invoices, data entry was almost everyday activities, I had experienced to learned to how to balanced sheet, helped managements,co-workers on monthly,quarterly reports, the most hardest part of job was I had to followed up customers on their monthly bills"
good,Home Depot taught me many things from gardening to basic construction but most importantly customer service. being pro account sales associate opened my knowledge and expertise to a greater extend.
good,"Great company to work for! Great culture and benefits. "
good,Supportive management team. Decent amount of politics but is expected from a company. Hard part of the job is supervise departments and deter theft. The most enjoyable part of the job is growth and development in the company from hard work.
good,"It was always fun working for home depot. I got along with all my staff and worked well with others. Everyone worked good as a team or alone , things still manage to get done."
good,"As the Merchandising Manager, within my first year sales to plan were positive ranging from 2.5% to 22% for 6 of the 7 departments I managed. By the end of my first year I had the highest sales percentage for 5 of the 6 departments included in the 4 week District Comparison.  During my last 6 months of employ I was assigned as the Specialty Manager specifically to improve this group of departments that were slumping in sales.  At the time I left, all areas except flooring were experiencing an increase in sales."
good,"aprendí muchas cosas en general, sobre todo a desarrollar el diseñador que llevas dentro es una experiencia muy buena ya que ofreces proyectos muy versátiles para los clientes y es gratificante saber que vuelven a venir contigo porque les gusto tu proyecto."
good,I enjoyed working for downtown locker room it was my real first job. I enjoy sneakers and clothes so I felt at home when I was at work. Management was okay they wasn't to strict. The co workers was cool that was the best part of coming to work because the workers made it fun to be at work. The most enjoyable part was the discount.
good,"great team player, has a lot of patience, quick and efficient,  takes part of various fun raisers, very good management team, very friendly, try to strive to learn something new each day.hardest part of my job would be not being able to direct a customer in way i do not know how to. my favorite part of my job is working with people and, and seeing them walk out with a smile on there face of my excellent customer service. Typical day at work is going on register , doing returns, helping every customer to the best ability that i can."
good,"My position now is a lot of fun but a lot of stress. I get to work at 4 am and perform what we like to call pack down. Basically i bring heavy merchandise out of the over head, like lumber and concrete. I have held many positions in my 9 years at home depot and everyone has taught me so much. I really get along with all my co-workers, they are all great people and mean well. For the most part management is great, i have had a few i did not agree with but it does not mean they were not good managers/people, we just had different views. I would say the hardest part of my job is the massive multi-tasking that takes place. Home depot teaches you to on top of you game no matter the situation. It really is a intense job but i like that i'm always on my feet and have the ability to help people in need. I would say the thing i enjoy most about my job is the people. Home Depot hires lots of great people for whatever reason, i have made some lifelong friends working at home depot and hope to continue too."
good,"Work environment is what you make of it."
good,"Exelente empresa para desarrollo personal a largo plazo ,pero muy baja la paga ,"
good,"Overall Loved working there sadly they are unable to work with schedules, including school schedules. Would rather lose a good associate than work them less hours. People you work with are some of the kindest and most sincere should be the happiest place to work, But can be difficult due to scheduling. If you want nearly full time hours even as a part time associate its a fantastic place to work."
good,"this company is very good to work for and they pay good as well depending on what title you are , the pay is worth the position you are in , good people and the stores know what to do as making money and keeping the customers happy"
good,"As a Flooring Specialist I work with customers who need all types of flooring for install and DIY projects.  I normally work afternoons until the store closes at 10 pm.  At times I am the only member of my department on the floor and with the largest number of aisles and products to sell; it can be impossible successfully reach all customers before they get frustrated or impatient.  I enjoy finding the best solutions for my customer's needs and making them enjoy the process and celebrating the end of their project.  "
good,"A typical day at work would involve myself and other freight members sorting freight into the store's different departments onto carts and then rolling them out there to stock them. Sometimes you would also have to operate equipment, but that's just something that comes with any warehouse job. I learned some nice organization skills as well as some people skills. The only really negative thing I could say about management is they pick favorites, as does everyone, and the only bad guy at the store I was at is gone now. My co-workers at The Home Depot were great. Everyone is really friendly and talkative and always willing to help each other. The hardest part of the job aside from moving up would have to be stopping to help customers ALL the time. I worked on freight team, so it's only natural I should be spending my time at work putting up all the freight that came in that day; however, this was made extremely difficult due to entire store being understaffed and the store manager refusing to make us overnight like every other freight team in the district, so very often was I putting my job on hold to help customers who couldn't even find another employee in any department. The nicest parts of the job though would have to be the ability to wear what you want after the store closed, the very nice and cool work environment, and the bonus check you get every 6 months. All in all though, it is a great place to work especially if you are wanting something long term."
good,"While working for The Home Depot I learned a lot about retail management, customer service, and being a great leader. Over the years I developed the necessary skills to become an excellent leader and I am eager to utilize the lessons learned as I continue to seek advancement in the retail industry."

good,"One busy day at work, I was restocking shelves in the electrical department and only had fifteen minutes left before I had to clock out. Four customers came over asking me for help with a certain product and with my electrical trade background I was able to assist two of them with the product and how to install it, but only had seven minutes left. Instead of leaving the other two customers, I ask one of my fellow associate to assist them so that I could finish my task. Often I find it difficult to do many task at one time, but learned that team work on the job site is a great advantage in getting things done and glad that management keeps enough associates on the floor during busy hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is to do the work assigned to me in an efficient amount of time!"
good,It is a good company it just need a little bit of more compensation for their employees.  And their insurance is really good I don't have any complaints about that either.  I wish we were getting discounts but they do have a bonus for their employees only if we make a certain amount of plans per year.
good,"I come to work t get the job done and get back home. I'm respectful, dependable, trustworthy, and punctual. I like to work around cool, own to earth people who like to get their job done as well. I do listen to my manager, and give my opinion when asked. I like to give ideas when it will help out the business. my favorite part of the work day, is when its time to go on break or lunch. Its always good to step away from the environment for a second and get some fresh air, then come back and start again."
good,"This company has a sound financial plan for stability within a growing market and although the benefits and pay do not equate to the work load, it is a sound company that showsed concern for its employee base"
good,Home depot was good for me because of the customers and it gave me the opportunity to help people which is something I live for I could have a conversation with someone and it made my day different when they would be so pleased with how I treated them made me feel good about myself.
good,"Working there isn't bad. If you do your job then you should be good. I'm pretty sure it was just with my supervisor particularly but there would be times where I would be unnecessarily criticized which would stifle me in doing my job. Otherwise, the company seems to care about your well being and focuses on keeping you happy so you're productive."

good,"The Home Depot Is a great place to work if you enjoy helping people and are physically in good condition. Staring with management, customer service and teamwork are superior. Most associates are energetic and enthusiatic about helping customers and each other. It didn't even feel like ""retail"" work to me. I learned a lot about so many aspects of Home and Garden products and being part of a team. They pay a reasonable wage and give many opportunities for advancement. You are provided ongoing training and good work is rewarded."
good,My work day here was helping customers in all departments. I learned how to operate a paint mixer as well as keeping the paint levels filled. I got along very well with everyone. The hardest part was learning the different departments.

good,"Being newly added member of a team responsible for keeping shelves well stocked in a timely manner. Trained to stock in a certain way I found wasn't very efficient. I offered ideas on ways to stock faster. Team was not very open to ideas or new members working more efficiently. The hardest part was arriving to work and not a single smile in sight. My team did not seem happy to be working there.I remained with a positive outlook and kept working, all though company offered a team, my team was willing to offer correct ways of doing things."
good,Over all the policies seem to be in the way of the service.  But the major reason I loved working at the home depot was the staff I worked with.  They were a family.
good,"Stayed busy, never the same, learned more of time management. I liked my co workers, the hardest was holiday resets, not enough breaks. Sometimes the store manager wants something one way, but it's supposed to be another."

good,"I learned a lot about interacting with various customers and in various situations."

good,As my 19 year career progressed from 1996 to date is was apparent that Home Depot's core values were the foundation of the company success.

good,the most enjoyable part of my job is to help a customers and see them smile at the end of the transaction and for them to tell me that they will recommend their friends to come to home depot cause of our friendly attitude. a typical day at home depot is when I can walk around the store and ask customers if they need help finding what they need and other items that will go with the item they wanted and then help them load the items into their vehicles.
good,"We are team players and discussed all issues as a group,if errors were made I made sure training was included to make sure that this would not happen again as we all know the errors start at the receiving doors."

Home Depot taught me to be versatile in my thinking, I've gained knowledge in different departments such as flooring and paint. I've learned how to install all types of flooring, as well as cut carpet and blinds, as well as how to mix paint. "
good,I loved my job overrall the managment was a little harsh but it was a great place to work and I would work there again if I could. The hardest part of the job is dealing with all the attitudes of co-workers and sometimes the customers.
good,"As an assistant manager I would start my day at 03:45 and leave around 15:00. The best part of the job was the people, both internal customers and external, who would ask for product knowledge or instructions on how to perform a task.  I loved the excitement of new challenges daily as they helped me grow as a person and a manager.  My co-workers and managers were outstanding people.  They would always share their knowledge in order to better prepare each other for increased sales and productivity.  The hardest part of the job was the long hours.  12 to 15 hour days were common and my personal life struggled because of it.  That being stated, the most enjoyable part of my job was making friends for life.  When you spend that much time with people, you get to know their likes and dislikes very well.  I will truly miss the ""family"" atmosphere that was enjoyed at The Home Depot."

Also included keeping shelves in the flooring department well stocked, and using a computer to set up installation times and materials for each customer.  Keeping management informed of all sales. Because of my 32 year background in flooring, I quickly became Top Salesman in my Department, and was frequently asked to teach other co-workers about flooring sales to help them produce good sales. I didn't find any part of my job ""hard"". I totally enjoyed my job.  The most enjoyable part of my job was having customers return to the store, and ask for me personally to help them with future flooring jobs, and they would also recommend me to their friends."

My coworkers (some more than other) were very helpful and wanted the best of me. They acknowledge my hard work and effort."
good,There are a lot of opportunities here  at Home Depot. If you want to move up within a company it will happen here. It is tough to balance work adn home life here with the amount of hours you put in. Management is great but demanding.

good,"Working with Home Depot's Interior Design Team was challenging and fun. Although it required a lot of knowledge of the products and salesmanship, they were nit above giving training and expert advice to both staff and customers alike. Any typical day consisted of having to engage customers and work with all different personality types; ensuring that the customer had an understanding of the product they were choosing and that they knew Home Depot was a professional company and would treat them like the preferred customer they were. The most difficult part of the job had to be having the drive to be able to get leads and not worry about sales. Sales was not part of the job, just getting leads and informing the customer."

Co-workers were very nice and were willing to help in any way possible. hardest part of the job was a customer leave without the item they came in looking for. Most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I helped make a customers day a little easier and that they were happy walking out of the home depot.
good,"Day at the home depot includes lots of customer service and shelf maintenance. Being able to answer question that the customer ask you and showing customers whee things are at it the store. Ive been here 3 years and its amazing how much you can learn and be able to use it in real life.life. I'm a person that is like a sponge where i would absorb everything, so i learn and i preach what i learn so someone else that needs the knowledge can use it. i know not only my plumbing but i know a lot in other departments.    Co workers are great and we help one another constantly and making sure every customer is happy. Hardest part of the job  is being by yourself and trying to help 10 customers at the same time. There are times where we are short staffed and are force to help customers that been waiting for you for 15 to 20 mins and they become angry  by the time you get to them and so they try to ruin your day. I try not to let them get to me and still be professional and answer there question in the best of my ability."

This process would continue until a call for customer loading/unloading assistance was made, in which I would go attend to the customer in need and assist them in their loading/unloading. Through this job I learned how to work with people in a hurry and how to take and give directions to people with limited physical abilities. The hardest part of the job was being the only attendant during the busy hours of each day in which my assistance was needed in several different places simulatneously. Being on my own most the time I didn't really have much interaction with co-workers or management unless it was during break or lunch. The most enjoyable part of the job was the gratitude from some of the customers after a heavy lift or tedious load/unload. Most were highly grateful for the assistance."

I learned alot about home improvement, sometimes customers would ask me a question that I didn't have a answer to and another associate would know and I would learn right there exactly what the customer was looking for so the next time someone ask me for it I would know the answer. To me the hardest part was keeping the store neat and presentable but I enjoyed it. The management was great, I worked at the Catonsville Maryland location. I just enjoyed going to work everyday being around the customers and my co-workers."

good,"If you love a fast paced and physical environment, this is the best position for you. I loved the physical aspect of it. Most of the managers can't seem to follow through on what they tell the associates. Direct supervisors don't hold associates accountable."

Management are very Professional, Co Workers are friendly and Professional.

good,"I loved working for the home depot, Iv worked for two different stores and i couldn't complain about either of them. I enjoyed walking in to the great people i worked with every one was always in a great mood and was always happy to see you. our slow days of course were always hard simply because you go crazy but you always had stuff to do and work to get done. The best part about my time working for this company was the costumers, most of them being regulars like the contractors, plumbers and painters and each one learned your name and loved hearing about your day as well as sharing about theirs, working for this company you will never forget some of the people you help they make your work day just as enjoyable as the rest of your home depot team."

My co-workers are often a pleasure to be around and very team oriented however we could use better management. I dont find my job very hard due to to experience. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with other cultures and learning more about them  and their values.
good,A day as asds was reviewing hours needed weekly for each department and as a whole store and forcasting how many assoicates where needed for each department and for what hours.  Reviewing the weekly and monthly training for each associate.  Updating necessary information for the store and scheduling who would do the weekly in store classes for the customers.  I enjoyed working with the associates and making myself available to them for what ever they needed. A totally open door policy is what I lived by. The hardest part of the job was telling managers that some associates where not providing the attention to customer service needs that we require and having the manager have the discussion with some associates that they were not a good fit for our store.  I loved working in the store everyday was a new adventure not knowing what would happen that day

good,Customer service is number one. Learn multiple product knowledge. Paperwork and lack of staffing can be overwhelming.
good,"I worked on the Mulch Wall. 30+ pallets containing a combined total of 2400+ bags of soil, mulch, rock."
good,"A typical work day at home depot as a Lot attendant was, pushing shopping carts from the back of the parking lot to the front apron of the stores location. I learned, when lifting heavy items, you must bend at the knees as proper lifting technique so you will not get injured. The manager at home depot was very harsh, at some points he would ignore a simple question, and walk away from the situation. The co-workers at Home Depot were very polite and helpful, but I kept to myself I never really talked to anyone at that job, I just got my work done. The hardest part of the job was, working outside in the rain. The most enjoyable part of the job was cleaning the inside part of the store at closing."
good,Daily management of controllables based off of daily sales. The ability to develop and train 150+ associates through servant leadership skills. Customer service oriented communication skills to enhance the companies brand and deliver on its expectations.

good,"I really enjoyed working there, it felt like a family. Was always willing to help you learn and grow."
good,"Providing excellent customer service was a major component of my job.  I was careful to listen to the needs of the customer and I recommended products based on what the customer's needs were.  I was careful not to make the customer feel pressured into purchasing Although I was assigned to the appliances department, I never hesitated to help out in any other department at the store including paint and the dreaded plumbing department.  If I did not know the answer to a specific question, I would find someone at the store who did or if no one was available at our store I would call a different store to get the answers.  The important thing was that the customer left the store knowing what they needed to know to deal with a specific problem they were having."
good,Home Depot is a wonderful place to work if you are a people person. They have great benefits for employees and you feel like you are a part of one big happy family. Home Depot is also a great place to work if you wanted to expand your career in the company.
good,"A typical day at Home Depot very simple:"

On a daily basis I learn more about the store electronic system. Collaborate with management to ensure customer satisfaction. I communicate with my co-workers to get the job done on time and in the right manner. The hardest part of my day is sending a customer to the competitor for an item we do not carry. My most enjoyable part of my job is having a satisfied customer. "

good,The Home Depot is a company that cares about their employees.
good,"	Merchandising products/tools according to planogram specifics, stocking and facing product and ensuring proper placement of signage, and keeping product organized to make sure stores look their absolute best for the customer."
good,"I started out as an early morning store prep associate. It was fun to fully engage my organizing skills. Everyday I down stocked, got rid of the generated trash, and made sure all aisles were neatly organized. Once it was learned that I possessed autonomy and construction skills I was set to task creating and setting up displays. When management learned of my affinity to learn I was charged with covering departments that were unmanned for the day. I ran the paint, plumbing, flooring, electrical, hardware, and kitchen and bath. I was told to interview for a Head Cashier position to fill the necessary amount of in house interviews needed. To my surprise, I was awarded the job after being with the company only 6 months. As a head cashier I was in charge of monitoring all cashiers lunches and breaks, customer complaints, return fraud, cashier training, monitoring and making reports on all cashiers, fulfilling change increase requests, monitoring the lot associates, and of course manning a register if lines were too long. I encouraged the cashiers to pursue their weekly goals of two credit cards per week as well as getting the customers to fill out the receipt surveys. It was definitely difficult to multitask all these things at once on a daily basis but my cashiers and fellow Head cashiers made it worth it. Management was not always as supportive as I would like but generally the sales floor was given to me to oversee, since they had many other duties to attend to. The co-workers, the atmosphere, the work was great!  "
good,Very fast paced and competitive. Long work hours but great group of people and core values.
good,"The benefits are great. They have profit sharing, medical, they will even help pay for school. Training for any department is done very well, and the company values its customers as well as their employees."
good,"I enjoy my job at The Home Depot, the people I work with create a friendly work environment and make it possible to laugh off the stresses of the day.  Everyone works fairly well as a team and we take care of the customers as well as we can.  I have learned even better time management skills and make light of tough situations, keep my head up high and keep going full speed ahead.  When I put my mind towards reaching a goal I will reach it, even if I have to ask for help.  I have one particular co-worker at the store who is extremely knowledgeable about the entire store, and is all the time moving.  He answers any questions I may have and teaches me different information i need to know in order to further assist our customers.  My personal favorite thing about Home Depot is the Homer Fund.  The Homer Fund is a donation based program where associates can donate as much as they want on a weekly basis to help out other associates who may need it for an emergency situation such as a family member has lost their job, or their home has caught fire.  Any associate can collect from the Homer Fund after applying to get some of the money.  After getting approval they will be able to get help from the Home Depot associates."
good,"management was fine, they werent around a whole lot, it was pretty laid back. worked plenty of hours"
good,"Loved this job...Met great people and loved this kind of work. Learned how to sell, and talk to people in general.

good,"Great place to work. good people, good management. Pay was okay and the workload wasnt too bad"
good,"Sales associate's, sometimes I was allowed to work in other departments which I liked doing getting to learn different things "
good,"The people in my particular store are good and friendly but I hear that's rare. The benefits were too expensive for me to afford. I have been with the company 3 years and would have hoped to, at least, be full-time by now. I would really have liked to been a supervisor. The training is long but thorough. They have a recognition program for good performance. They put a lot of emphasis on customer service which is great for driving sales but it can be hard sometimes to please everyone. Management was great when I first started but it changed when they brought in new people; now its lacking. There is little personal connectivity with them and they are never around when you need them."
good,the days as a freight team associate is very busy and challenger.
