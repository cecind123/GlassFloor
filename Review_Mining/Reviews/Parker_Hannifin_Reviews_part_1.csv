rating,review
bad,"This company only cares about the bottom line, they don't care about their people or their families. They don't care about family/work life balance. Especially in their aerospace facilities where their employees are grosly underpaid for working on airplane components. Upper management will tell you what you want to hear to avoid dealing with the issue. I was a tenured employee workedg way up thru the ranks and the constantly screwed me over at every turn.thru the ranks"
bad,"Company is filled with non graduates."
bad,"Parker hannifin Hiawatha iowa second shift weak lead and fail supervising ."
bad,"On a typical work day I performed maintenance on an inferior system"
bad,Being notified 2 days before the next work week that you no longer have a job is absolutely ridiculous. Production was super slow for 6 months or more and if they knew they were going to let people go they should have notified employees sooner.
bad,They are very unfair they treat there people like they don't care about them. Parker is a very bad place to work. I would never advise anybody to work for them they are very unfair. That was the worst place I ever worked.
bad,People try to backstab you constantly for their own gain. They expect you to work overtime. They take advantage of you and purposely don’t promote or sign on from their agency company unless you threaten to leave in some cases. Very toxic and drama work environment.
bad,Sink or swim culture. No direction from management. No advancement opportunities. If you aren't in a certain click you will not make it as a salary employee.
bad,"They hired people with engineering degrees from accredited Canadian universities to work in the assembly line and pay them with minimum wage. It says a lot about this company. There is no chance for advancement and they just make you work in the manufacturing facility despite your qualification."
bad,I really don't have a review this was a job through a temp service and the only reason they hired me was because I was a veteran. didn't really have a need for my experience
bad,I worked 8 months at a temp was told i would be hired after 3 months never happened. They brought in more temps then said they were over staffed and let me go.
bad,I didn’t get the proper training then put me on night shift. Then they let go because lack Of performance   I feel they set me up  fail  So no I wouldn’t recommend this job or place to anyone
bad,Will not recommend this job to anyone due to extremely poor management and this stress this causes on everyone. I highly recommend looking somewhere else first before applying here.
bad,If u are new u will not be respected no matter how hard u work the team leader will lie on u and they will not try to find out the truth u don't matter
bad,"Claim to be a family company, got denied taking one day off for funeral preparations for my grandmother. No proper directions to make work bearable. Absentee management."
bad,I would not recommend this company anybody this company has poor judgment character they laid off and 2014 mostly laid off all the good employees and kept the lazy ones but I guess that's what they value more lazy employees the plant manager likes to sleep around
bad,Bad place to work. manger of warehouse is rude and never there when needed.People work there have been there for a long time and they can not stand for new people to start
bad,They do not care about there workers the where all rude didn’t care about if the workers are hurt they lie about how long Saturday working in my training they said maybe 2 more months that was lie
bad,"Supervisor was a disaster, not being professional at all."
bad,"poor management had a lot of conflicting views, unsafe workplace no supervision no proper training no standards, not a clean working environment. very discouraging place."
bad,"The Place was very lonely and depressing. You had no one to talk to you, it was always loud and the workers were okay but needed improvement. When it came to training it was very poor everybody acting like they did not want to help me or would get frustrated when it came to helping me. The team leader would always told me to go slow and the other worker or guy would always have something to say when it came to my part numbers being low. They need a lot of improvement when it comes to training new people coming into there company because if not your going to lose a lot of good people. I wish the company the best of luck!!"
bad,"My job was to build up everything for the people who were putting parts on filters like two different hand primers,two different duck bills, Building heaters and more my job was very easy and I did like what I was doing"
bad,"The time I was there it was hectic as to get it all transferred to CA. Enjoyed working with the few co-workers I knew. This is all I can say, I was a temporary hire."
bad,"The managers suck they expect you to do the work of 3 people and no increase in pay. The workers all lie and stab each other in the back they do drugs in the work stations, come to work drunk"
bad,"I believe if you have nothing good to say, you should not say anything. If someone wants to work for Parker Hannifin, they should find out on their own what it is like to work there."
bad,very stressful and mismanaged work environment warehouse is very disorganized there is no accountability there as well as no room for receiving to store production products
bad,You are not a human. And you have no voice. You do not have the right to assemble. Water is not a basic human right. Your bathroom breaks are OUR bathroom breaks. Your Lunch is not worth our time. We will cut your pay. You will not argue. Each year your personal assessment will yield you nothing. All your overtime is annoying. Were looking into replacing you or moving our facilities in search for slaves. You will not report your injuries. We own you. You are nothing.
bad,"Was hired then layed off due to corporate ,one week after supposedly hired, was called four weeks later and told that company was having a cutback .. really messed mty finances up."
bad,Nada recomendable en cuanto a superacion profesional referente a sistemas
bad,"bulling procedures, disciplinary actions for everything, very not recommended place to work. Half of the workers leave, the other half will leave soon, the HR department thinks that it can treat employees with disrespect."
bad,"The time I was there it was hectic as to get it all transferred to CA. Enjoyed working with the few co-workers I knew. This is all I can say, I was a temporary hire."
bad,"Poor management, low paying they penalize you for not working overtime. Expectations are way to high for the amount they pay you. 30 minute lunch, what a joke!"
bad,Management listens to one side of the story and bases their decision on that without hearing your side. My job was to handle finished product and supply production lines with raw material. Often times other employees with the same title didn’t complete their work
bad,"No job security at this place unless your family. Nepotism in full bloom here. Set you up to fail, just needed help to get caught up due to everyone going on vaca."
bad,"goodbye to the most corrupted company that I've ever worked for and i'm glad it moved to another location...I was really fed with the favoritism and poor management. I regret spending the last decade here. I had great memories and made some great friends. I will not miss the culture of the company, But i will miss my ex-employees"
bad,Loyalty means nothing to this company. They let go of employees just as fast as they hire them. McDonalds pays better than this place. Management has no clue about what's going on with their own employees.
bad,A typical day at consisted of pulling orders based off ship-sets.  The ship-sets were prioritized by deadline times. There were 5 deadlines on 2nd shift.  I learned additional management skills with the company after advancement.  The culture is extremely poor most employees have been there for 8+ years and do not like to train new people.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the negativity from veteran employees.  Management is extremely inconsistent 5 supervisors in 5 years most only staying 6 months.
bad,"Pay is terrible, management sets you up to fail, hr department refuses to do anything their job description states, your lucky if you get 10 cents as a raise once a year, dead end job where good employees are pushed out the door by management that doesn’t care about anyone and reminds everyone how terrible they are and how they are replaceable."
bad,"I cut and prepared hoses for shipping or storage, as a production assistant another responsibility was preparing and maintaining the workstation.  This could include replacing the hose reel and ensuring that everything was in its place."
bad,Very poor training program. Extremely Undermanned. Supervision lacks proper leadership abilities. Does not support military Veterans. Absolutely no benefits.
bad,Parker in Forest City North Carolina is a very cut throat unorganized place to work. All they do is pull temps in for heavy work loads and then just cut them loose. Some were even promised with hire positions after 90 days and they never even kept their promise. Poor management. Would not recommend even wasting your valuable time with Parker. No hopes of being hired on or any advancement.
bad,"a typical day at work was a busy day."
bad,After 17 years of working my butt off for them I had a few problems with some bad parts and for my yelling because of my ADHD which they Knew about so they fired me and had a cop waiting outside because they thought I was going to do something that's how this company treats you
bad,Things have changed to the point that employee moral is at a all time low. Benefits have been reduced and departments eliminated. Other companies in the same industry provide the work life balance that people need.
bad,nope not a great place to work at all... the delievery rate is .0001 % on time which i have no idea how that is possible. Plus they started on only two shifts and they moved to three shifts so not really much overtime available.
bad,Poor leadership that would frequently lie to workers to persuade them. Stressful work environment with constant deadlines that are never met. Contractor workers can expect to wait over a year before they receive and benefits including sick time.
bad,"The management is terrible, upper, middle all of the above. Overloaded with work, horrible attitudes from all the people, talked down to by management, management has no idea about the jobs and processes. Rules and companiy policies put much more strain on the job itself. Hard workers are rewarded with more work while nothing happens or is said to the lazy employees. Pay is same for everyone."
bad,"Working at Parker is a nightmare, there is only time to work. the lunch breaks are sub standard, there is always someone making you get back to work. if you are in a section that is 10 minutes from the break area...that only give you 5 minutes to have lunch. there is no structure, the management does not care if you are exhausted from the forceful labor."
bad,"Cleaned, sanitized and packed medical supplies...maintained medical supplies and shipped to required medical clients.  maintained proper medical records for required clients."
bad,"The noise level is unbearable, the atmosphere is cut throat. People that are friendly are genuine friendly, others will rat you out o save themselves."
bad,"The appearance of this company looks great from the outside, but internally is terrible. People are retiring in droves, everyone is doing 3+ jobs, wage increases haven't happened in 6 years (not even to compensate for inflation) and they hire under market value. Minimum 5 people leave this company per month for competitors for better treatment."
bad,"c'est une société qui avais beaucoup de potentiel il y a quelques années et à ce jour c'est devenu n'importe quoi, très mal diriger avec cette nouvelle direction."
bad,Everyone out front is in charge and run the company. This just leads to chaos and everyone wanting their stuff done. The actual leaders worry about themselves and want they have going on. The main agenda for all of them is eating and meetings and eating at meetings. Temps. are brought on as a game and will not be hired unless they are a chosen few.
bad,"Typical yank company, employees treat as if they lower than whale poo, asset stripping tossers."
bad,"One of the bigger shielding companies in the business with a significant brain trust and quality products.  I learned a lot about human nature and the dynamics of mergers and acquisitions.  Unfortunately they (Chomerics Division of Parker Hannifin) suffer from extreme channel conflict and truly believe that their distributor fabricators love the Chomerics Division."
bad,Typical day is very aggressive with every one running around like they dont know what do to do because we always waiting for management.
bad,"No assigned working seat/office working daily.  Noisy and busy environment.  Wait for weeks to install computer software tools."
bad,"Worked for a short period of time."
bad,"This company does not care for it's employees.  You are just another slave that has to deal with upper management drama and there is NO job security here.  The management just plain out sucks, best to steer clear of this company!!!"
bad,"Out of the ~10 companies I've worked, Parker was the worst. Just an example: They had me change to 5 different desks in just a 2 month span (and each new cube had no power or network... making me miss important deadlines)."
bad,"A typical day at work would be processing invoices and other normal work as required for the contract worker position I was in. What I learned about this company is that they are great with their direct hired employees, but if you are a contract worker or a temp, you will get the very short end of the stick. Management is fantastic with their direct hired employees, but again you are constantly reminded that you're only a contract worker or temp and you're treated as a second class citizen. Also, if you're a contract worker it is frowned upon to ask for more than a day off to take care of personal business, etc. If you are a contract worker or temp, don't be sick or dare ask for time off even for a dearh in your family otherwise you'll face the consequences. But if you're a direct hire, you can ask for days off without any worries or problems, and if you call in sick, you won't face the scrutiny as a contract worker or temp would. The co-workers that I worked with were nice, but one was not. However, people out in the shop were friendly and would smile at you, as oppose to a few in the main office building. The hardest part of the job was walking up and down stairs anywhere from 3 to 4 times a day, and if it is month end, you would have to make more trips to pick up the shippers for invoicing. People with arthritis or other ailments to the back or legs would not fair well with this job. The most enjoyable part of the job was actually just working and getting my job done. Overall the company is great for someone who is a direct hire employee, but for someone working as a temp"
bad,"Typical day of at work usually starts out by greeting friends and starting the process of filling out daily paperwork and machine vacuum,pressure,and temperatures. Being at this company for 5yrs i've learned how to run numerous compression and Liquid injection machines. I've learned how to maintain them and clean them. At this company I really cant trust many people. The last year or so was a mess. Everyone trying to get each other in trouble and made the day such a stressful one. Enough said tho."
bad,"Terrible management,  HR even worse (in the year I was there 3 different HR people were all fired and each more conniving than the last) work 10s or 12s every day plus weekends. no training, they point to something and say go do it. No chance of first shift for a decade unless you take a huge paycut (job is around 12 an hour)"
bad,"Hours are terrible,work starts slow."
bad,"Managment is grandfathered in and does nothing other than stare into thier computers but complain constantly about production when the equipment your given is from the 60s but yet your expected to meet modern production standards , pay is extremely low (10) for a company that is making hundreds of millions even after the bills are paid they could easily afford to double what they pay but refuse "
bad,People bully you and nothing happens. Life happens and you get in trouble. They say they care about the safety of people but they don't. They lie to you when you have your interview with them
bad,"Aucune gestion du temps de travail, on fait des HS obligatoires a gogo alors que pas de travail."
bad,"On top of the discrimination, favoritism and politics you have the polluted atmosphere in the machine shop. On sunny days you can see the sparkling near the skylights from grind dust floating in the air. The workers are breathing this all day!"
bad,"Parker is great company to work for accept in aerospace division in Irvine Ca,  they need to work for woman workers and advancement for them .Need to improve the Information Technology department working condition and promote more woman workers to Management position in order to diversified Management culture."
bad,"Drama filled, terrible upper management, Troublesome. just an annoyance. Dont allow you to have a life and work. Makes you choose between your familys safety and emergency's or a pay check. No smoking of any type. just terrible in general."
bad,"Unstable, Management is horrible, benefits aren't the best, only 15 minutes for lunch, fired someone over ""suicidal"" tendencies while they were seeking help."
bad,"No strategy for site , internal politics running wild and all good staff have left. Even well paid MD walked out! Says it all. They employ loads of temps and staff in tears every day"
bad,"Es una compañía internacional  con una fuerte inclinación por el desarrollo de aplicaciones y tecnologías con  una  estructura muy  importante en  otros países. Pero que a  nivel local no guarda relación alguna con las oportunidades de aprendizaje  y desarrollo  que expresa el mensaje de la corporación , nula capacidad de desarrollo y administración, privilegiando  el crecimiento financiero  y no ponderando en lo absoluto el crecimiento conjunto del personal"
bad,"My day starts at 8:35pm and goes to 7:05am five days a week. At the beginning of the shift there is a team meeting where announcements are made and work assignments are given out by the work leaders. I have learned most of the manufacturing areas in the plant and currently a CNC machine operator. I work with the machine and parts to customer's specification and process. In a 10.5 hour day one gets a one 15 min break and a 30min unpaid lunch break. Wages are low although management will differ of course and say that they are competitive to the current market. Although looking through the job listings many companies offer a lot more for similar work. Management is hard and non respondent to employees concerns it is ""my way or the highway"" attitude and forced overtime for everyone. Benefits keep getting cut and more expense to the employee. The employees are hard working individuals just trying to make a living and are in constant battle between work and family life. Most are dependable and put out the best products that they can. The hardest part of the job is going to work and there is no job satisfaction just more hurry up and get it done and move on to the next one. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving and using all available vacation time to get away from the working conditions at the work place."
bad,Management is very out of touch with day to day operations and there is an over whelming amount of favoritism.
bad,"Sweat shop to say the least, It was hot and the management was worthless. And this is being nice, really nice"
bad,"Use to be a good place to work years ago . Newer management all they care about is production, not the people. Lots of back stabbing and constant drama. Not a very motivating place to work."
bad,They don’t care about the quality of the products for the customers Who much favoritism people from California thought it was better than Holly Springs people and did not want to cooperate with us
bad,I was working at a good job for 9+ years and Parker contacted me through email and had me come in for an interview. I caved and said ok what could it hurt. They made me an offer I couldn’t turn down so I accepted with a promise of being hired long term for retirement. That lasted 33 months. Got laid off now seeking for work when I was comfortable at my other job. Liars liars liars
bad,This used to be the best place to work between the job itself and benefits. After they expanded and burnt out majority of the town they took inmates to work there out of desperation. High turn over rate for a reason. Mandatory 6 days a week work week. There’s been a stabbing and inmates selling drugs out of the building. All that aside most leave due to no life balance when they have only sundays off. They are millions behind and the lines break constantly with hours of downtime. The employees are cattle and the management makes sure they know they are by telling them they can be replaced. RUN!
bad,The Bussiness unit manager has no idea how manufacturing works. He is nothing but a numbers guy and if he doesn’t make his monthly numbers he takes it out on his subordinates. They tell you that your success is our success but this is just lip service. They schedule on a DOS based system that is growing cobwebs. There are two leads that are cry babies and go around your back every chance they get. When I started there I was told that the leads did not want me there and I feel that management supported this. There was no onboarding and I was told that Parker doesn’t onboard very well. I wonder if they ever heard of continuous improvement. When I tried to hold employees accountable they ran to management and cried . This place is extremely micro managed with no clue how to complete a project. This company is still manufacturing in the 1970’s and seems to be stuck in a time warp. In order to grow you need to be on the cutting edge with technology and training. They don’t even have a maintenance dept. If your not taking care of your equipment it will not take care of you. If you want to experience 1970s manufacturing in 2019 go work for Parker.
bad,"Management has no clue about Manufacturing, Outdated systems running DOS. Micro- Managed. Throw employees away without care. Departments are not synchronized. Bussiness unit manager does not know anything about Manufacturing and is just a numbers guy and is only there 3 days a week . No Leadership."
bad,You work 6 days a week and every otber week 7 days. I have children at home and im a single mother so tbis is not ideal. They dont care if you vet sick or if your children need you. I would work there if i had no kids cause that would be ideal for tbat enviroment
bad,Management is a joke.  Harder you work the more they are on your back to do others jobs.  They are always behind on orders and expect you to work 12 hrs everyday and you work EVERY Saturday no questions asked.  Did I mention Managent is a JOKE?
bad,Stagnate vertical mobility.  Lack of clear vision from General Manager.  Top down pressure is the only way things get done there.  No Lean vision to speak of.  Every man for himself mentality.  Stay away.
bad,"Management are not interested in employees as people, simply expecting you to cope with increasing workloads while employee numbers are cut time and again based on irrelevant forecasts made by out-of-touch senior managers who are only interested in career building and blatantly ignore skyrocketing stress levels amongst staff."
bad,Very poor management. Work is directed to move product out the door and little emphasis in quality. Poor training. Does not look for the most talented employees.
bad,Anyone on the floor was little more than another piece of machinery. The management had no respect for the personnel and would regularly move them from one shift to another; such that an employee would be total at the whim of management's decision not just for the number of hours but also for which shift. I was hired and trained for an advertised position and shift and within 90 days was told to either move to a different position and shift or quit. After taking the new position and working back to first shift they restructured and again put me back on third shift. I worked back up again and three years later they did the same thing again.
bad,"No time for family, mandatory over time thru the week and always mandatory Saturdays.Company has pretty decent benefits, vision, medical, dental, 401k, and can invest in stock."
bad,Superintendent lacked coordination. Severe micromanagement made work more difficult and slow. The company had a culture of harassment and humiliation.
bad,"In this place i Started doing the credits for Enzed branches only, then got asked to join the customer service team, from there i learnt alot about the products."
bad,Lack/non training given poor management left working on own in office at night up to 8pm when hours are 7am till 3 pm expected to use own car to deliver components to subcontractors
bad,"Management pits everyone against each other here.  I was in fear for my job from Day 1 till the day I was laid off.  You spend 70% of your time covering yourself so that somebody who is doing a poor job cannot put management attention on you in order to save themselves. I've never worked in a more hostile environment, and I've worked in retail.  Blast email arguments, other employees taking credit for your work, employees framing each other for not getting stuff done, absolutely nutty progress expectations; I felt like I was working in a mental hospital.  How could they let it get that bad?  Here you have a company with an excellent reputation and a history, and they are having to bus in H1B visas to cover for all the ill advised layoffs and firings over misspellings in emails."
bad,"Good production staff let down by senior managers."
bad,Parker burns through people like nothing I've seen. There is no real balance between work and family time. They push their employees till they either look elsewhere or quite. The quality of senior employees has falling due to the fact that less and less are there to train newcomers.
bad,"Product is rushed. all that matters is getting it out the door so managers can get bonuses. Race card is highly used here to get ahead or as protection by bad workers. You will never get into the clicks already established but will be targeted if you say or do the wrong thing. NDT here is a hot mess with disgruntled employees and little pay or room for growth or training. So glad I left, don't work here if you value your reputation & integrity."
bad,"Hostile work environment. Supervisors and managers allowed to yell at and intimidate engineers and workers. Management have their little clicks. If you are in the click you are good. Managers and supervisor support each other in a non-spoken code I got your back and I will not let you fail even when you made the mistake or wrong decision. So when an associate disagrees then the management circle the wagons and start the intimidation tactics of workers and engineers. Management does nothing to solve problems, just blames engineers. Managers are good at assigning, blaming and loading up work on coworkers/engineers. Unfair when given out bonus shares, saying you have to do something special, but giving others shares just for showing up, the click factor and used as hostility towards those that management dislikes."
bad,To make sure that on a daily basis everything that's needs to be done for the day is completed. I have learnt so much experience and to always obey your superiors. Management comes first and the workload they give you as at the end of the day you need to keep the customer happy. My fellow co - workers are like my second family as we are one big and happy family that work as a team and give a helping hand to one another. The hardest part is when is month end when everything needs to be done and make sure that all the paper work has been processed for that particularly month. The most enjoyable part is when you have all the right answers for your customers and always making sure that you always makes them happy.
bad,Una empresa que despide a las personas sin criterio. Se suponia que te daban un feedback. A mi me premiaron con una carrera y con haber ganado dos veces el mejor empleado del trimenstre. Toman decisiones por el chisme y no por evaluaciones concretas.
bad,"When I first started, the culture was great and you felt like the company cared and you mattered.  Over the years, things went downhill.  As people left, their vacancies weren't filled, leaving departments short-staffed and remaining workers just expected to suck it up and absorb the extra work because ""corporate won't approve any new hires.""  Everything became about numbers and the bottom line.  The culture changed, and it was very apparent that people didn't want to be there.  Pay was good, but not worth the stress and perpetual aggravation.  SO relieved to be free."
bad,"The whole time working there I heard and saw nothing but misery. The turnover rate is asinine. The company ""Parker"" itself is a great company but at the Triad Drive Location it horrific in just about every aspect."
bad,"When I was hired I was told it was temp to full-time after 90 days. New manager came in and changed all that.  Co-workers were back biting."
bad,"A job can be dissolved in a moments notice....upper management and HR doesn’t even know what you do for them.  Hours of OT isn’t enough for management to understand what your responsibilities are, even if you work with them on some projects. They listen more to other people then fact finding."
bad,"The HR Department is horrible, nothing is kept confidential.  There is NO loyalty here, if they don't like you, they make up things just to fire you no matter how long you have worked there.  There is nothing but petty people, snitches and bullies that work here.  The employees that actually do their work are the ones that are singled out and eventually end up losing their jobs."
bad,Very nasty people. All the employees do is gossip. I kept to myself at lunch and breaks and was considered not part of the team. The pay is good but the environment was very hostile.
bad,"The company  had good benefits  good pay and a great 401k package. With good  medical , dental,  and vision  benefits. The problem for me was employee retaliation. The workers and some supervisors began a practice of subjecting me to belittlement, berating me, and I fell someone  out something in my water, causing diarrhea,  stomach cramps,  and nausea. I felt that continued employment in this setting  would not be beneficial to my health,  as doctoring my water had happened more than once.  I felt for what every reason, the employee  were being driven by supervision to cause me to leave for some unspecified reason not know to me."
bad,The new management team is playing too much politics and threads. They blame people for safety issues and threaten to fire them. The previous GM was really friendly to employees.
bad,"Haverhill is a place filled with long term employee's that whine and complain about everything. The new employee's are fresh out of college and have no clue on how the working world revolves"
bad,"The company is a great company to work for, but the Ft Worth plant is poorly run. Management doesn't listen or care about employees. The pay is significantly under industry standards across the board, and their dedication to quality is lacking at best."
bad,"HPO imagine what this stands for and consider it spreads into a there plan offers, culture, life balance and only breeds in there invalues. "
bad,very clickish. floor people get away with anything.log in for 12hr. but only work 3.management afraid to hold employees accontable.
bad,Esta empresa tiene muchos detalles con la administración el día de entrevista te tienen todo el día desde las 9 al asta 3  esperando  tienen favoritismo
bad,"Supervisors, Especially The One On 3rd Shift Will Walk Around And Make Inappropriate Comments To Employees, Then Deny It To HR because Obviously Hes Made A Career Out Of Walking Around A Warehouse Making Good Workers/Woman Feel Worthless. But It Was An Easy Good Paying Job. Just Watch Out For Bill."
bad,"It’s deff a clicky place, your in the circle or your not. No personal life. Will work you in the ground with mandatory ot for months on in and super lazy  management but if you need to find them they will be in there office accomplishing nothing besides to tell you they are behind with orders. If you like the ot and no life but decent pay it’s a perfect job for you."
bad,"Go there for the pay. Not a great place if you have a family or want any sort of work/life balance or job satisfaction."
bad,"Family affair. As long as you show up daily and play like you are dumb, then this is the place for you. Great benefits. You have to write your own review, then a lead that has no management training reviews your performance and decide your raise. Pray they like you."
bad,"My first two weeks of working for this company was fine, work was easy,  a teenager can do it. My third week working at Parker's turned into a nightmare.  The person that was training me started harassing me. When I reported it over and over again to my supervisor,  Human Resources, and Manpower(which is the Temp Agency I went through), nothing happened. There were other employees who witnessed this behavior and reported it to the Supervisor also, and the Supervisor ignored it.  Actually, the more it was getting reported, the Supervisor got mad about it, and he as a supervisor, started to retaliate against me, and started harassing me as well. I couldn't believe this was actually happening to me. I have seen things happening  in this  warehouse that shouldn't be happening, and that is not legal, due to how uncomfortable this situation got. I made the decision to walk away from it. I hope no one else has to ever experience this at this location."
bad,"No comment.    There’s really nothing needed to say.  Either I had a bad experience there or.,,, it is really as bad as I think it is.     It’s hot.   It’s oily.  HR dept. is terrible.  The employees that have been there the longest work the least. Complain the most. Do not like new employees.   Backstabbing.  Lying.  But the money is great for 3rd shift"
bad,Do not work for Parker unless you have too . The culture thier is horrible and sad . Their culture is to keep production workers in their place with no chance for advancement. With poor work procedures and low standards.  all the employees thier are 10 year or more veterans of the company which don’t leave because of the time investment otherwise I feel they would leave if they had less time invested with benefits. because Parker really doesn’t have any positive benefits. Just a paycheck every week
bad,"I worked there I thanked god for my job @ the time. I liked working with some of the people. nothing was never good for the upper management  I have nothing else want to say."
bad,"Many people weren't paying attention to what they were doing , they expected too much work in so little hours and supervisors didn't know how to properly speak to employees"
bad,"I remember that the employees were negative and just different acting. There was sections that everyone sat at for lunch. Each ethnic group stayed with their race, it seemed segregated. There was alot of competition between the employees. It was too much of who got more done in an 8 hr shift."
bad,Management does not support work-life balance and does not listen to department experts. Executives care only about keeping stock market happy and are not focused on long term growth and success
bad,"I worked for Parker for 13 years total, all on second shift. After being there10 years, my first shift coworker retired. I bout in for the first shift position and was turned down. They hired someone from a different plant that was supposed to be our savior.  Well that flopped. After about 2 years of him being there I found out he was making one-third of my salary more per year than I. Confronted management about this and all I received back was there is nothing we can do for you. Well I just cannot do anything for them."
bad,The most political company I've ever worked for. Management sits around dreaming up BS schemes to convince corporate headquarters to justify their jobs. Don't give a rats a-- about the employees.
bad,Management lacks... lots of OT but only cause  people quit on a regular. pay is horrible here people work hard and get paid so little and anytime they try to go union they flip out and start promising things to workers.
bad,This company is behind the times.  Culture and computer systems are stuck in the 90s and early 2000s.  Pay is not on par with similar jobs functions and responsibilities in Houston.  Parker would rather suffer in quality and delivery instead of hiring people even when the site has over 600 hours of over time.
bad,"Management treats the workers with disrespect, and has no compassion, moved operations that was here for years out of United States, leaving people that worked over 25 years jobless in a town where jobs are very very very hard to find."
bad,"I developed one of the most profitable products at this company and still got laid off. At Parker it matters more about who you know than what you know, or how exceptional your work is. Great place to retire if you just want to put in a few years without working or accomplishing anything, but if you want a career or have any ambition, look elsewhere."
bad,Greedy conpany to work for all they care about is saving a buck. Thats why there closing so many shops down including my shop in akron ohio.
bad,Did not enjoy the department I worked in (Reliability). There was no teamwork and everybody seemed depressed and angry.
bad,"I was an excellent worker, my rates were always high, my parts were always good, I got a long with my team. My manager said to my father who at the time worked there that I was doing good, but that it was a popularity contest. A girl that had left before but came back wanted to be hired in as did I, now because she had left I had seniority over her and therefore shouldve been hired in , but due to her relationship with the team, I lost the popularity contest and was told I wasn't a good fit for the company despite my good work ethic. Two weeks after being let go, I found out she was hired in. They always give bad references to future employers even if you were a good employee. 100% do not recommend working there."
bad,"I give parker a zero, most poorly managed place I  ever worked in my life.Got a 3 cent raise in a year, yes 3 cents. The Team leads are invading of privacy and dont know how to talk to people."
bad,"Management wanted to cut corners in the inspection process. When I refused they sent me home to ""think"" about wanting to be a Parker employee. After 3.5 years of loyal service, I was forced to give my resignation. I could not do as they asked and turn my head in the inspection process.."
bad,This job is a highly stressful job with no opportunity for advancement.  I did like working on my own and to be creative when I needed to.  I would not recommend working for this company.
bad,"They had me as a Backup for every possible position. Paying me $13hr  I started as a machine operator then setup then material handling, heat treat, Tech 2, QC  ext."
bad,"in the time i was at parker i found most of the people to be frendly"
bad,"Stressful work place with the poor management. Salary compare to other workplace is not satisfactory. Other benefits are not satisfactory."
bad,"A typical day is build part of a product because they never have all the parts. Management is horrible, clueless and has a number of times talked down to people. The hardest part of the job is being there."
bad,"Empresa grande até boa de se trabalhar, mais os superiores não são muitos bons, são muito ignorantes, e à área onde eu trabalho é terceirizada e não tem muitos beneficios, por isso to tentando um emprego melhor pra mim poder ter ganhos e benefícios melhores."
bad,"People do what they want here.  Call in sick once a week -  whatever.  Make scrap parts -  meh.  If the manager doesn't like you, then you will never do anything right.  High turnover if they can get people. "
bad,Your worked very hard wit two ten minute breaks and a 20 minute lunch. You will bring home 275 dollars a week tops and get laid off in the winter.  There are much higher paying jobs everywhere else.
bad,Parker Irvine sinks its future into building large FBW systems that were OEMs to build. There was a lot of risks associated with this systems and although the systems were deployed on several platforms it came at a huge price of pushing people to 3 shifts of work and they failed to win new FBW business. They pulled in cheap labor from India and there is no future for large systems any longer. A lot of good people paid the price in the end through a loss of jobs. Shame.
bad,"Heavy mobbingr"
bad,"job environment is RACIST !!!!!"
bad,"As my role is plant associate i my self control 12 hour's shift rotatingly, as i am very proud to be work in this company but it is very difficult to work and maintain really it is very critical."
bad,is a good company but is stressful to work there.Plus...u don't have the possibility to advance because there just the favourite people go up even if you are able and you demonstrate your skills in a high standard.No contract possibility.
bad,"This is a great place if you want to put work above all else. When the company wasn't letting people go, they would work certain departments day in and day out."
bad,"Loved the work and my team mates, learned a lot about tube bending and the complex set-up procedures, however the moral was very bad due to leadership on the floor and as a result of bringing this up with HR I was evidently terminated."
bad,"I randomly got fired for a reason that didn't exist by a person in the staffing agency that had never met me, and had no idea who I was. I had never even met anyone in my staffing agency and thought I was getting hired on full time when I was brought into the office. All the staff liked me and my work performance and work ethic, so it was completely random to be fired from ""hear say""."
bad,"Verbal harassment at another level. Most of the, ""older people"" disrespect younger people for their age. Belittles others they view as a threat to their position. Plays favorites among employees. Use of racial slurs and passive aggressive actions are welcomed. 100% a let down."
bad,"What can I say, by far the most abysmal management I have ever had the misfortune to work for."
bad,"When you're new, they treat you like you have an IQ of a toddler. Of course newly hired employees are gonna asked questions over and over even though they right the info down only because they don't wanna mess things up. They are very impatient and they rather talk than work."
bad,It was ok.  Fun people to be around until the witch walked in and everyone stuck there noses in there work spot.   Its crazy but also good people there
bad,"Our way or else. Spout team work and how we're all in it together but the reality is very different. Since Parker's takeover about 2 years ago rapidly gone downhill, only listen to people who kiss butt"
bad,"My typical day at Parker report to my area for daily goals of building units. Set up the line to get your numbers. Alot of cross training working. Meaning learning different jobs. Because your not stuck in the same spot all day. Making sure everyone is on the same page, as far the goals for that day. And pulling to together to meet that goal. And the most enjoyable part bout the job is the i love what i do. Its a good feeling, no what are whom am building for."
bad,"They allowed people who were awful leaders continue to be leaders. This made me never want to come to work unless this person was gone or on another line for the day. This person was sexist, made vial comments about other employees, had made multiple employees walk out and they continue to let her work there and get her way. I felt SICK hearing her talk about other people. Line leaders are supposed to pump us up and make us want to work. Not bully us into doing what she says. Line leaders are not supposed to be scary people you are AFRAID OF! Doesn’t matter how many times I went to supervisors. All of my complaints went unheard and the best option they could come up with was removing me from the line when I was NOT the problem. And my other coworkers on that line can vouch for me on that. As far as I’m concerned, the whole equal opportunity workplace motto that they preach needs to be re-evaluated at the Yankton,SD plant. I wonder how many more employees are going to walk out before they finally decide to make decisions that will better the company rather then bettering themselves. Something needs to be done. Otherwise they will continue to have a huge turn over rate. Especially at the Yankton plant."
bad,"Ho lavorato a gassate"
bad,Work should not feel like slavery. I saw a lot of snitches from the door petty ones. It bothered me how this place runs. Just by hearing in person how they treated their employees made me sick. I was a Temporary Worker. I asked to go home knowing I was never going back. It is not a good work environment. I have worked for many companies. This one is a joke. They have no compassion. I left after 5 days. I overheard they fired one of their employees for having pneumonia. I got sick instantly and asked to go home. I was never gonna return. I wouldn't want to. Look at the turnover there. So you know I am know I am not lying. Find you an employer that cares about you. This is not it.
bad,"For Many years Parker Hannifin was an excellent place to work. However, recent management changes have brought about completely unnecessary changes to the way they do business. You do not build a successful company when the people who design and build your products are shaking in their boots awaiting the next axe to fall .An extremely profitable division in Oxford Michigan was closed as a result of an opinion of new management to ""reduce footprint""The end result is an ongoing mess that has been created at Oxfords sister division located at Haverhill MA. Anyone with talent who wants to succeed in their career should steer clear of Parker. You can't fix stupid..."
bad,"Very Demanding place to work. Unfreindly ERP, MRP systems."
bad,Only way you grow is if your kissing up or always all over the people in charge. supervisors have their favorites and they don’t communicate with you at all.
bad,"I loved the plant I worked at and the position was very neeed.  Was disliked by corporate manager who was severely out of touch, let go due to cut backs for position to be re-opened 1.5 years later.   Didn't even apply had 0 interest in working in that corporate environment.  Loved my direct manager and my plant manager everyone above that was a typical corporate villian!"
bad,"Management sucked, human resource tells everybody business to everybody, they talk to you like trash and they're racist. They have favorites, thanks speak to you like you are a child."
bad,They believe that the job is more important than your family life.  They expect you to work seven days a week. The pay is not worth that kind of dedication.
bad,The company changed hands while I was there and the reviews stopped as well as the support.  The company is still private owned and there is a family that runs the Dallas area.  They obviously look out for each other and if you are not in the family you have no chance for advancement.  If one has a problem with you then they all do and they will stop all support and you are left to fend for yourself.  I loved my other co workers and staff.  However the family takes credit for any good work done by the staff.
bad,I would not recommend parker. I got the job through a temp service and had a 3 month contract for temp to permanent. After 6 months i still had not received an interview and then they cancelled my contract with the temp agency. I didn't miss any work was never late and i made all the hourly rates they had in place. They gave me no reason for cancelling my contract.
bad,It was a nice place to work at. But it was poor management and could have been much better. They could have handled the employees better. Pay rate could have been higher.
bad,"Worked 8 hours sometimes over time. Trained for 1/1/2 years on  two year centerless grinding position. "
bad,"A typical day at work consist of following the company's guidelines and performing your assigned job for the day. There are various work station and I was able to work in each of them. At the packaging station I learned to make boxes and gather the materials that needed to be packaged. There is an assembly station, and I learned how to put a generator together. I don't think there is anything hard to do at the job. I loved working in the assembly station."
bad,"Basically, they exploit there financial reps. for contacts. Out of 15 - 20 new reps., I was the only one that lasted longer than a year before finally getting burned-out."
bad,"I was one of the best machine operators in my department and that had no bearing on my job security, 18 years experience and that was not even considered before termination. I violated a policy I didn't agree with and was let go. Just kicked to the curb for no justifiable reason."
bad,Es ist im Prinzip eine Art Familienbetrieb und man sollte es verstehen sich aus den Fehden Grabenkämpfen rauszuhalten. Nicht befristet anstellen lassen.
bad,Parker-Hannifin Stratoflex is a sinking ship you do NOT want to go there. The management is very poor and they are VERY stingy when it comes to spending money.
bad,Only apply here if you have no where else to go. Management is terrible. Pay sucks. You get one raise a year and the average raise is 35 cents. Very very low profit sharing. This company is lossing money because of bad deals with customers. Management doesn't care about you or your opinions. It's been a revolving door job. Always new people in and out.
bad,"Extremely hard job with unachievable goals for the shift. Very, very hot. Few employees all cut throat for their numbers, floor managers were poor examples of employees, talked behind your back and so on... witnessed a few confrontation take place."
bad,"This place treats people like they are disposable. No training, no skills, and they allow senior managers to bully, and intimidate employees. The turnover rate is alarming at best."
bad,I was employed as a temporary Machinist Technician. My role required me to finish grind spools for hydraulic actuators for aircraft. The machines were pieced together each night as the equipment was obsolete and not supported by the original manufacturer. No supervision was on-site after 10.00 pm and employees to advantage of the absence. I was continually moved from one department to another. After my six months I resigned (mutually) as full time work or work place stability was not available.
bad,"need a better safety program, some managers need to leave they don't communicate to good, its a who you know job. They don't listen to well, in one ear out the next."
bad,"management could care-less about anything that happens on the floor,there is a few co-workers that are ok to work with. The others could care less about it."
bad,"Because of poor management, I was able to better serve my employees as a supervisor. I was mistreated along with coworkers. Due to mismanagement, I became a better employee and supervisor for other employers."
bad,"Long work hours,lots unpaid overtime,lots weekends.  Management often takes employee as granted. Managements seldom shows any appreciations or recognition for their hardworking employees.  Pigeonhole employee and almost never provide any technical skill training anymore.  At Parker CSD, they have no interest in employee's welfare or well-being.  Management is treating everyone as interchangeable head count.  Currently Sr. Management are strictly reactionary with no even an outlook strategic planning beyond couple month. "
bad,Its a ok place to work at. But as temps we get loaded with extra work. The employees in that company gives all the work to the temps to do while they just sit back and yap away.
bad,Good opportunity to start out.  Lots of hands-on opportunities for engineers. Non-Union workplace allows for participating more in the process.  Lots of good workers on the floor.
bad,"Parker has so much potential, unfortunately they have antiquated beliefs. You are constantly being micro managed and unless you have a college degree you are not likely to move up. It's a daily struggle to get the answers you need and the management team all have their hands tied. They need to take a hard look at the wants and needs of their employees."
bad,"I have worked throughout the different plants there . Plant1, Plant2,Plant3, And among the DC Plant. And had been considered to do a good job among my coworkers. This past year was just so stressful for a lot of employees!! They have raised the quota on a lot of the machines and have never replaced any employees. When we have had 5 employees retired in just the Furnace area alone. Some where forced to either quit or retire early.!!! I had told that Plant Manager The I would like to RETIRE THERE ALSO.  But he made sure that I couldn’t do that. There have been plenty of employees that was forced into quitting , because of this Plant Manager at Plant1. And he was FIRED within a week that I was let go. By the way why are they throwing away GOOD STUFF AWAY? Because they don’t want the overflow of materials and products!! That to me is a waste of product when it is good !! And I was active in some charities there. Alzheimer’s was my main charity that I was active in. And the CANS THAT I HAD RECYCLED WAS PART OF THAT CHARITY among others that I had given the money too!!WVERY SINGLE DAY SCRAP IS THROWN AWAY FOR SOME STUPID REASONS."
bad,"I’ve heard it said, People don’t leave jobs, they leave management. This is the reason I’m leaving Parker Hannifin GTFSD in Glendale AZ."
bad,"You spend much of your time training temps in very complex processes. They hope to be hired on, find out they never will be, so move on. And, the training starts anew. I thought it was just our department, but it appears it's all the departments on our floor at least."
bad,They work you to death I didn't receive a weekend off for a whole year I also worked 58 hrs about every week for a year and a half in Kearney Nebraska
bad,"The vision of the CEO is empowered employees, sadly his vision doesn’t translate to action. People’s performance plans aren’t controlled by the people being reviewed.  Their is a lack of open communications between middle management and top management."
bad,"Management continually tells people about ""plans"" for the future with no follow through. They have a ""we need a warm body"" mentality. They stick you where they want you regardless of your experience. If you bring this to their attention, you're promptly threatened with your job. I have an extensive cnc machining background.  I was hired as a ""machinist"", job title is ""machinist level2"", was put in an area that has nothing to do with machining."
bad,They are trying to get us to find a way to become engaged but have been treating us unfairly and when we bring up the problems they ignore us so we will never be engaged! It's a paycheck and that's all !!!
bad,"Start work at 5 am "
bad,"The manufacturing floor appears to be the strength of the Ogden facility. I'd give manufacturing jobs at Parker Ogden a solid B. Engineering, management, and supply chain in complete disarray."
bad,"This is a place to work that has lots of overtime."
bad,"Great place to start, not great to advance in your career. The benefits got worse every year. There was a high turn over rate of upper management.  The bonus checks kept getting worse and worse every year."
bad,"If you simply need a job.. it's a good place to be.  Be prepared for very excessive overtime that is mandated and disciplinary action if unable to work 50 - 60 hours a week, every week."
bad,"Does not value its employees.  It is all about the money and they do not appreciate their largest asset (the employees).  Emphasis use to be put on employee development, leadership development.  Their High Performance Team program is a joke."
bad,"Poor overall management team; favoritism rules with unfair promotion and pay practices. Persons having little or no leadership skills are promoted into this type of position. New persons are hired at a higher rate of pay than existing, long time employees leading to poor morale and animosity towards them and leadership. Certain supervisor and lead can be loud, rude, obnoxious and bordering on megalomaniacal. Public dressing downs is common practice with this team. This is just one business unit that is out of control and does not reflect all as there are many positive reviews of various units throughout the U.S."
bad,"Parker's culture is moving toward a 'no degree, no hire' environment.  It became extremely difficult to compete without a degree even with 30+ years of sales experience."
bad,Years of no pay rises despite repeated circular emails claiming record profits. Absolutely no way of progressing internally. No bonus scheme for any but the 'chosen' few.
bad,"used to be a good place to work "
bad,"They make you work extremely hard and long hours of the day for literally nothing. You make minimum wage, and the management team is rude and doesn't care about employees."
bad,One of the least professional employment experiences I have had.
bad,"This has become a company that cares more for the bottom line and their “image” than for your value as a human being. While they won’t come out and say it, it will be made known to you that you’re expendable. Your thoughts and ideas, experience and knowledge will amount to just shy of nothing. The management is only interested in looking out for themselves, and if stepping on your corpse would make them look better, so be it. I beg you, think this through. Know and respect your value as a human being before handing it over to a corporation who would be more than happy to take all that you have to offer and push you out the door for the next warm body. Since Parker Hannifin has taken over this company, there has been an almost complete overhaul of not only the staff, but the entire culture. They make jobs and lives harder in the name of “safety” but expect an increase in output. And those who would dare to point out the flaws in this and many other areas are silenced, swiftly and aggressively. They’re only interested in those who are willing to say “Yes,” no matter the cost. We’ve witnessed the loss of countless outstanding employees and even a handful of crummy ones. When even the rats are abandoning ship, you should really start looking for the hidden calamity."
bad,"No começo era uma fábrica boa, mas com as mudanças piorou o comportamento com seu funcionários"
bad,"Site is poorly managed. Some of the management people are not suitable for the positions they represent (bad manners, dresscode, poor communication with employees). Any problems coused by the people above are blamed onto operatives."
bad,"no lead way for outside business"
bad,Good pay and benefits but not worth it in the end. Management is never  engaged. Exec put themselves first.  Processes and systems are ancient. The burden of local P and L without the benefits of a large corporation.
bad,"Parker Chelsea is all about hitting the metrics. Managers have absolutely no people skills or care about their employees. If you do not meet their standards of killing yourself to make their bonus checks look better then ""parker may not be the place for you"" this is what I have heard from day one. Lots of things promised and nothing fulfilled. Insanely high turnover, hostile work environment, and workers rights constantly violated. I am surprised a suit has not been filled already."
bad,"There is a trend with this company going on, the value the employees that slack all day and expect the good worker to make the difference and if we point that out they say we have a bad attitude!"
bad,"No work - life balance.  Greater than 95% of time spent on the road.  Most time spent traveling, but no appreciation for personal sacrifices.  Problems with centralized - division priorities."
bad,"If you have no experience in the aviation industry this could potentially be a good place to start. Equal opportunity does not exist unless you're a woman. Pay is absolutely horrible. There is almost zero opportunity for advancement and the means to get there are unclear to almost non-existent at best. The way they run their temp agency is incredibly unethical. Do not leave the HR office until everything that Jerry Wallace said is written on paper. Management for the R & O Department will lie to your face and do not have your best interest or the customer's at heart. You will never get a thanks or good job, instead just more assignments with no compensation. Parker has become the job you get so you can comfortably look for another."
bad,high turn over .since old management retired or moved on it has become hard to deal with .never happy with job done always try to find faults always need more have to hit there numbers
bad,"Mucho Favoritismo, cero preocupación por su gente, todo es producción producción producción."
bad,"Parker used to be a great place to work.  Then the CEO changed over and so did the culture and decision making.  This job used to be so good.  I was happy coming to work.  I was happy tackling the problems and issues that came up.   But the last couple years, it became really hard to watch the E-Suite dictate decisions that would not work.  Then having to clean up the mess.  Lot of talent walked or got laid off."
bad,"The company is old, stable and doing manufacturing. Not my cup of tea but if you would like to go to stable place and do less and try to retire there with COBOL skills, then that could be your place to be."
bad,"Poor company culture. Probably the worst I have ever experienced. Every little thing is judged and held against you. Zero flexibility in work impossible to grow. During my short tenure there, more than a dozen people had left this division for our competition."
bad,Decent place to work if you dont mind the oils used within the job. Horrible communication between workforce and employees and they tend to focus on the things you are doing wrong
bad,"Parker is very competitive.  Unfortunately this flows down to their suppliers.  I did not agree with the way they managed their suppliers.  Also, the workload was unfairly distributed.  Their systems were old and very cumbersome."
bad,Top managers have been there a long time...protecting their turf.  They keep piling more work on while more people are leaving.  They expect too much....the result is...nothing gets done well.   Lots of management meetings where the same things are discussed week after week and month after month...but nothing improve.  No listening skills.   No Enviironment Health and Safety manager.
bad,"Parker has really changed from an employee appreciation based company to a shareholder only, cold company."
bad,When new management took over screw everything up because they wanted to go lean.  Jobs were late everyday and people quitting every week. New hire either never show up or quit same day
bad,"Malgré des compétences élevés et un marché de l'emploi tendu. J'ai été ACCUEILLI !!"
bad,"supervisors do not treat all workers equally, making false accusations to get rid of least favored employees to bring in personal    friends & friends"
bad,"years behind on technology ,very inefficient in way things are done. Management does not do anything are afraid to make any decisions ."
bad,"Great product"
bad,I enjoyed the place and the people . The management prior to the current management should have been kept in check. The layoffs are many so job security dosn't exist. Did learn alot though. Sorry to go.
bad,"The Company its self is an ok place to work, the people could have been more understanding to some people and not ot others. Also there were very little priority set for the jobs."
bad,"7 Days a week 	Accurately performs the worked presented to him/her daily."
bad,It is a very good company to work for and is a very friendly and family oriented company.
bad,"Not a good place to work if you are female. Hostile language, philthy environment, unsafe place to be.  No chance for advancement for women. Co-workers were the best part of this job. The hardest part was putting up with discrimination and harassment from managers."
bad,Company is slowly down sizing and it's not a place to continue or persue a career.
bad,not fair to all to many want to be bosses The work was one i enjoyed to do
bad,PH has a reputation for high turnover in the state of UT. Got the impression they were changing their ways during the interview process. I was incorrect. Be careful.
bad,Parker has decent pay but the management is terrible which leads to mandatory 12hr shifts all week for months or zero available overtime. The management treats employees like they don’t know what they are doing and don’t care about anyone.
bad,"Experience is different in different divisions/locations of the company. Mine was very bad, because my manager was totally unsupportive and did not want me to succeed. Also my actual duties weren’t corresponding with what was advertised when I applied for the position. I left after 6 months."
bad,Always behind in production expect long hours to be worked while management goes home. No leadership on the production floor most employee’s do what they want. A lot of standing around talking
bad,"I used to love working at Parker, it was a great place to work that I did not mind. When new management came they completely screwed that plant over. Over the course of 2 years 1/3 of its Employees have been layed off, or voluntarily left for another company. That in its self should say enough. The management is horrible. The layoffs have stopped, but people are still leaving to this day."
bad,"I worked there for almost 3 years. It took me almost a year to get hired on from being a temp. I was one of the most trained people in assembly and knew all areas, but advancements were given to people who had been there less time and without as much knowledge. Favoritism is a huge factor at Parker."
bad,"I was excited to work there as I believed that they promoted from within and had a culture of training their people.  Started as contract and was converted to FT.  That went fine for a while until I was put on a project that was just constant development with very little room for air. Once the was wrapping up after 6 months, my immediate manager was changed and the new manager was obsessed with outsourcing as much as possible. So instead of training me on something else, I was laid off. So no, Parker does not give a care about employees who work hard for them. The second you have a manager who doesn't like you or want to save a few bucks so she can hire remote people from her native country, you are outta there."
bad,"Upper management had no problem scheduling an entire month of work at a time.  If there were any voluntary overtime days,  management tried very hard to make you work while still saying it was volunteer. Most of my coworkers said they couldn't live of the 40 hour pay check. Office was difficult to contact unless you physically went and found them.  Poor training.  Very seniority oriented."
bad,"Pros: Very competitive pay for the area and quarterly profit sharing checks are offered after 6 months.  Many other employees are friendly and helpful."
bad,Management is horrible.Allot of favortisam and no one is happy. Everyone complaining all the time due to no life work balance.Manatory overtime each day. 12 hr shifts.Management plays golf and other activities outside work with the favorites. No appreciatetion for hard work and long hours.
bad,This job was really fast paced. They don’t train very well. They are not very organized. Their management sysmtem needs to be helped. They really over work you.
bad,"I enjoyed my time there half the time I was there. It really changed once a new manager was hired. Also the plant manager runs the place as a dictator and is quick to tell people they aren’t doing their jobs well with no real ideas in ways to improve, you can’t win with him. What really turned me off was the win strategy they have and the ideas of having empowered employees who have a voice, hardly the case there. Also no room for advancement and they don’t put anything towards employees advancing in their careers or improving. In fact they were trying to take away responsibilities. The disconnect from management to employees is bad and created a poisonous environment. Used to be a great pace to work, but turned into a secretive environment that felt like you couldn’t trust people around there. Their ability to find replacements and train people who are coming is laughable, don’t have much hope for the current regime there."
bad,Basically no room for advancement and integrity in management as usual. If you want to pass the time this is the place for you but if you want to move up then please pass this company up unless you know someone on the inside that will promote you.
bad,Good pay but poor management. Work was easy but fast paced. The machinery was very faulty and broke down at least once a night. I liked most of my co workers but felt the management was very biased.
bad,"The company was okay, the management could be better, the shipping and receiving lead could be better, she was the reasons due to so many leaving, the occurrence thing was a bit ridiculous, they weren't as professional as they make their self to be."
bad,"Typical ""we say it, but don't live it"" company."
bad,Another company that ghosts their candidates. Very unprofessional recruiters.  If you say you're going to follow up then do so. Not doing so is rude..
bad,good company / people friendly / have a major problem with the turnover in management / your pay is determined by other peoples reviews which isn't fair
bad,"I do not recommend working at Parker Hannifin Fluid Connectors. They have a very poor work environment and don't seem to care about their employees or hiring in their temps. For being a wealthy company they don't seem to invest much into their machinery and expect high rate on poor running machines. Parker Brass is also know for mandating their employees every Saturday and Sunday, not giving much time off."
bad,The culture is not conducive to allow employees to have enough decision making ability in any position that they are in and does not provide for engagement of employees even though they continually state they want engagement by all levels.
bad,"I was told it was a M-F job by HR when I was hired. It ended up being M-S with different start and ending times for 1st shift. They were in the process of making it a 7 day a week job when I decided to leave. If you enjoy average pay with good benefits, but no time for anything.... thus job is perfect for you. I was an ""Order Picker"". Not to mention you will be required to throw 500 boxes per hour on the belt. If you enjoy breaking your back daily apply now!"
bad,"Management expects you to live at work.  Poor communication from management.  In one year I had 4 Saturdays off and one was due to holiday.  If you want to advance, pick another company.  Operations manager runs the shop by fear."
bad,I am seeing a lot of Mexicans getting hired on here so you know the company is failing. The biggest raise anyone has heard of in the assembly area is 37 cents a year. That's not even close to cost of living. They have a high turn around.  I am getting my application out there before this place sinks.
bad,Management is terrible. If you bow down to them you will be alright but don't have an opinion on anything. The work force is getting worse as the younger generation are coming in
bad,"A empresa no Brasil passa neste momento por uma mudança cultural, com implementação de lean manufacturing e ferramentas de gestão de pessoas"
bad,Decent place to work. Pay is solid and the work isnt physically demanding. The training is ok but could be a little more detailed for each work function.
bad,"Stay away from Waterville, OH location.  You will never be hired on. They just want people to tape up as many boxes as possible, could care less if you have warehouse experience"
bad,"Safety committee member, 5S champion, I I assign and monitor operators on the shift, High Performance Team Champion, CPR certified.  Implemented continuous improvement ideas."
bad,Ve firme ktere pracuji se mi nelibí rozlisne financni ohodnocení.
bad,"Parker Hannifin Corp. was a lean  manufacturing company which means old equipment, poor benifits and no time for new ideas. My co-workers were very nice helpful friendly people doing the best they can."
bad,"Trying to be positive about Parker Hannifin Manufacturing Ltd but have learnt recently that at the end of the day you are just a number. "
bad,This company was about the employees . There have been so many changes in leadership that this company . There is fighting between both first and second shift .
bad,This was an assembly line type of job.Piece work. Fast pace from brginning to end.
bad,Parker hannifin acquired gulf coast seal ltd on 11/15/2010 and I worked for parker for two and a half  years the hardest part of working for parker was all the changes from a one owner company to a huge corporation- parkers computer system is antiquated and what use to take one or two steps to accomplish a task now took several steps- oil and gas business was is a new adventure for parker and it was difficult to retrain the gas and oil companies to parkers new terms and conditions after twenty five years of being with gulf coast seal and abiditing by total different terms and conditions. Most enjoyable part was solving problems for the customers and keeping them happy as well as our inside sales folks. 
bad,Watched numerous companies purchased by Parker disintegrate in rapid succession. If you are purchased suggest polishing the resume. Senior management will receive the retention bonus for keeping key employees until the company is absorbed. If in sales watch out for the matrix to determine bonus - its a joke made for upper management to achieve their targets- KPI
bad,"Great exposure for entry level position. Quickly gain process and operations knowledge. Must be able to learn and adapt very quickly. Position involves problem solving, technical documentation and management of capital projects."
bad,The company rarely gives raises. 3rd shift works most holidays and don't receive extra pay for it. They was always short-handed and expected us to pull extra weight for the same pay
bad,"Management is a serious downfall to this company. There is no experience in management. There is favoritism within departments. Nothing is safe, if HR knows it, every manager knows it. Loyalty and honesty gets you nothing in this business. If you’re a good clock milker, you can get as many hours as you’d like. Oh and it’s not Quality that’s important, it’s the all mighty dollar"
bad,"Most peers in the trenches are the most sincere and hardworking people I've had the pleasure to work with.  The environment is very ""target-rich,"" and with the proper attitude, strategy and tactics from management would be a pleasure to actually work on."
bad,"They built jet pumps where I worked. They only had their contracts with aerospace companies because of sleazy old salesman, corporate greed and lobbyist work. "
bad,"I have been working at Parker for seven years and they are a very stable company with lots of work, but the management expects everyone to work 10-12 hour days and on weekends to meet production goals. Raises are slow and other companies pay more. The benefits are pretty decent, but a little costly. There is advancement opportunities for hourly personnel, but there some opportunities for salary personnel. The facility I work at is a relaxed environment and everyone is friendly, but the work pace does make it stressful also."
bad,typically required to work 12 hrs a day monday through friday and then work all weekend for months at a time. Can be hard to balance work and personal life.
bad,"Parker Hannifin at the Corporate level has some great benefits and treats employees well.  They compensate employees well and have a desire to promote and do leadership programs.  Parker had some reductions due to the economy and reduced a lot of those leadership programs.  I didn't like some of the local leadership at a Washington, MO facility but overall a great place to work."
bad,Managers micromanage every aspect of your job and expect 24/7 availability of even the lowest level employees.........................................
bad,Not a good place to work.  Stressful and sometimes a hostile and unethical work environment.  Not a worker friendly environment. Training for any new task was minimal and insufficient.
bad,"Only certain people advised on career advancement opportunities while others who are capable of doing the job are passed up. External job linked sources for hiring instead of hiring from within."
bad,"Overall, from other locations, Parker is a good place to work.  As with all global corporations, focus is on the bottom line.  You don't get to being around 100 years by not watching your bottom line.  Latest CEO change has had some positive and some negative impacts.  Change is certainly hard at any level, but at my location there was change just about every year.  In almost seven years I reported to six different managers and in one year to three different and for a time even to the GM of the location.  With that many managers it is difficult to grasp what your focus should be."
bad,"Salary & benefits are average, and commissions structure is also average.   Overall earning potential is good, but not great."
bad,I loved the environment there. They pay was great. I inspected car gaskets looking for any defects. Recording and reporting hour by hour production. Managing PPE and keeping sir area clean at all times
bad,"Overall, Parker is a solid company that has a decent pay and benefits package.  However, your health will suffer for it as the culture is very dysfunctional.  Management is indifferent to employees' work-life balance and careers and also seemed borderline inept at times.  Resources are limited so it's hard to accomplish goals.  Very dated IT systems.  Many projects are implemented without any real upside, a ""check-the-box"" mentality."
bad,"This was a great place to work for the pay. Co-workers and last supervisor was awesome. This is an autocratic work environment which takes direction for every detail from the City Manager. Very low chance for advancement. This is a great place to work for those who like to be told what to do, and like the to sit at your seat working 8 hours a day."
bad,"It was a pretty depressing place to work. A few people were motivated, but the rest had a dead-end mentality. I hope the culture is changing, some of the managers are trying to get new energy in. Go for an interview and see if it is getting better. Best bet is a positive attitude and thinking the best of people."
bad,"The management structure changed and they pushed out a lot of talent and forced a lot of people into early retirement. With several rounds of layoffs, they found creative ways to get rid of and/or marginalize the good people that remained. "
bad,"Arbeitsabläufe werden immer chaotischer durch ständige Verfahrensumstellungen und Entlassungen oder Kündigungen"
bad,The pay is good but a very unhealthy place to work. Its nasty there with all the cancer chemicals they use there in production. The cancer rates for older employees are through the roof.
bad,"Progress is being made but the amount of voluntary departures speaks volumes for the state of things right now.  Lack of appreciation (fair compensation), inadequate management support and unrealistic expectations top the list for why the culture is so fragile."
bad,"Parker Hannifin is a good company to work for if you are young and ambitious, the people I work with are great."
bad,"Management shody,benefits great ,HR  at the time was far from par company never appreciated the extra you would foto get the job done benefits were excellent but came at a cost"
bad,Job can be slow and then show up to work one day and there is an overwhelming amount of product on the shelves. Not much cross training so a few people and up responsible for large amounts of specific product. Pay is really low for the area. Most people have to commute 30+ miles in a carpool because of the horrible freeways and cost of travel and living.
bad,"Was a great place to work with many incentives, however, new CEO came in and cuts were made all over the place, many employees were let go and workloads were drastically increased.  Many incentives such as in office massages and assistance with acupuncture and massages, health incentives were removed."
bad,Too few people doing too many jobs.  Very stressful.  Hostile work environment.  Other employees look down on you for taking government sanctioned breaks or for not working overtime every day.  Management keeps saying it's going to get better... it's been a year.  It's not going to get better.
bad,"This company wants you to work overtime forever.  They really don't care if you have time to spend with your family.  It's all about the money for them, and you are just a cog in the wheel to help them make more of it.  You never hear the end of how you need to do more, faster, and better.  The equipment is poorly maintained and, mostly, outdated.  The tooling and gaging is severely lacking, and they show no thought of purchasing more modern equipment or tooling to help their people do their jobs."
bad,Parker turned out to be one of the worst places I have ever worked. Most employees had the drive of union hourly employees. There was no accountability. My team lead went to sleep daily @ his desk in plain sight of internal & external customers. No PROBLEM.  It was a very frustrating work experience.
bad,"I start with orderding material via MRP planning."
bad,"Já trabalhei em empresas muito melhores, que valorizam mais os profissionais e seu lado humano."
bad,Recent economic conditions have forced company to cut future development projects and focus on job cuts to maintain bottom line. New leadership does not understand the culture and how to grow a fortune 500 company.
bad,Good place to work but has had a major roll over of management all of which have little to no aerospace experience making development and R&D impossible.
bad,"Job security stress affecting all employees. Due to massive redundancies, more and more work is being given to the remaining people."
bad,Too much documentation and not enough engineering. Most work is outsourced to India. Very little technical development
bad,"I worked in a factory on an assembly line. We definitely had to have team work. If someone was moving slower we had to pick up the slack to make up our numbers. It always felt good when we exceeded. I learned how to weld pipe and iron. Safety is important in these companies because the machinery is expensive plus can be dangerous. The hardest part of my job was in the beginning learning how to put together the parts, but it got easier the more I did it. I liked the job because it was the highest paying job I ever had at that time. Management was good , but I wasn't working there long enough to really know them."
bad,"That job is for people wich they like money and for you, if you don't care how cruel they will treat you. I work there 5 years still without a contract."
bad,management has no tolerance for anything going on in your life if it effects work they will let you go you are expendable do not thin that if it is important to you it is important to them
bad,"I was given a assignment each day to either pick, pack, or ship using motorized equipment. As Team Lead I gave out assignments and also completed shipments. The pay definitely could be better and there were no chance for advancement. As a leader I had much respect from my co workers."
bad,"I've NEVER left a good, or in this case, a great position.. I have left incompetent leaders. There is a high school type clique self-evident at Parker Hannifin. My immediate supervisor showed some promise but was in a job over her head. She was unable to motivate, lacked compassion for my employees and didn't understand the basics of production labor requirements. I feel that in time with proper mentorship, she will prove an invaluable asset to the company."
bad,"A slow and fast pace work environment. Life and money importance. Celebrate birthdays, sports, and development of kids on how much is given and taken from families and companies."
bad,This job was very boring and the company was incredibly bureaucratic. Once you are hired its hard to get fired at this cubicle farm where dreams go to die.
bad,"The company overall isn't to bad to work for, but some current management changes have turned the company into a mess.  Miss management has led to multiple 7 day work weeks then the next week we ran out of work by Friday morning"
bad,"It's not the best job nor is it the worst. It's my first factory job and I think it's easy to grasp onto. Management isn't the best, but they are improving just as we're improving with our scrap.best first factory job to start out with!"
bad,"Working there isn't too bad. Everything had a balance and it was easy-going to say the least. I enjoyed working there for 9 months. I would go in and start packing and when I get caught up in packing I go to the shipping area and start shipping out the packages, sorted from UPS, US MAIL, FED-EX/EXPRESS; etc. I was effective and quick and like I said, it was an easy going job. Although there were complications due to employee/management relationship and a hostile work area since I was 20 years younger than most of the employees. Sensed hostility whenever I would always go in. I eventually quick because I couldn't stand to work in that area anymore."
bad,"Challenging environment as I was a member of management at the Jacksonville, FL site.  The employees are a pleasure to work for and work extremely hard for you, but management team and HR is the problem there."
bad,Decent benefits  but company is based more on flashy marketing than delivery of product.  PH has gotten heavily embedded in the outsourcing of everything possible.  U.S. based organizations are antiquated.
bad,"It’s worse than high school, too much talk on personal information on people, with little to no information on the person you’re spreading rumors about."
bad,I had a great time working with parker. They have great people to work with and you can learn a lot from other workers. They was just like family. Nothing other then some really great people
bad,"I liked what I did, but the environment has become increasingly clogged with meetings, team assignments - basically anything but work.  We are so bogged down in meetings we don't have enough time to do our jobs."
bad,"I had high hopes going into this job. And there are good things about it, however I feel like their expectations of employees are growing and the rewards are becoming intentionally difficult to attain. Recently management asked employees what they could do specifically to reduce turnover. I feel like we gave a lot of valid answers, and was hopeful because they seemed to be receptive to them. Then we had a plant meeting where they said in a nutshell, we are not making any policy changes. Until management is willing to listen they will continue to have problems."
bad,Not a great company to work for unless you had been there a long time.  Very old school and you are just a spoke in the wheel.  The people who had been there a long time definitely had an advantage.
bad,don't work there they only hire temps doesn't matter how hard of a worker you are or how much OT you voluntary for to show them that you want to be a part of their company they will look past you.
bad,"The job duties were good, but management  was not very good didn't manage workers very well to get production done. I feel they could have managed things much better then they have."
bad,Parker is a very competitive company. They pay very well and give ronas once a qutar wich ate useally pretty high. They are a family orientated company wich means alot
bad,"Typical day was fairly predictable, though workload spiked exponentially close to the end of the month. The culture within my group was positive overall, but become very negative after my supervisor was promoted to another division and we assigned to the general manager.  "
bad,"The people I worked with were great. Unfortunately most of the control was turned over to another facility so we had little to do with operations at the end,"
bad,"I was an intern who was doing experimental work. I had a standard office environment working with my boss to create new tech for the company to use, unfortunately I didnt know how to achieve what they wanted and they didnt know the amount of work that goes into what they wanted to try to do. So i ended up being over worked and overwhelmed with doing something alone that should have been divided up between a small team of 5 people."
bad,Very busy company I learned a lot. A very demanding and pressure situation. Your expected to perform at the highest level. You will be put in different situtations and expected to perform at the highest level and then be reviews accordingly.
bad,it was ok. There was not a lot of opportunity for growth. There were great people that worked there in my opinion. Awesome atmoshphere.
bad,industrial environment takes time to advance people and culture not defined.  Not an enjoyable place to work.
bad,Its a great company to work for.Alot of overtime.Daytime job.Good people work there.
bad,My overall opinion is good. There were people at Parker willing to help and offer their expertise.
bad,"It was a good job just didn’t really like it, I didn’t see myself doing that for a lifestyle job. Some days wasn’t much work for me to do, wasn’t a good job for me."
bad,Plant manager ruled with an iron fist. Belittled people. They didn’t make you feel like you were respected. A better plant manager would make people perform better.
bad,"Work in the warehouse is fun and easy and always something new arriving which keeps the job exciting most of the staff there are very friendly, although the management at Parker wasn't the best, decisions always getting changed, and communication was at a low with these decisions, one team leader in the warehouse is extremely rude and over forceful with getting the job done, no one could relax and enjoy working around him, he tends to have a laugh and play a harmless practical joke on an individual at times, which is fine at the time for him, busy or not but when the same is done in return, he makes it out as if that individual doesn't care, is lazy and hasn't got a clue or tells them to stop wasting time,.."
good,"I was hired through a temp agency. This was to ensure that they could cut anyone they didn't like with no issues and not have to offer benefits. After a two week process of getting hired, I finally started. They said they rarely worked weekends, when in reality, they work every last Saturday and the last week of the month is always going overtime. The very last day of the month you are there until they feel they have got enough orders out, usually after 10 pm."
good,It's easy job. Don't like the management. Too many chiefs not enough Indians. To advance in the company you need to know someone. Half of the group leads don't know how to run the machines. Is too hot over the summer no A/C but fans.
good,Mooresville PSC under bad management      A lot of backstabbing and lies. Definitely can count on HR siding with management and retaliation will happen.
good,Worked there for 2 years and the management somehow got worse. The office manager doesn’t care co-workers are friendly most of the time. The work environment is like every person for themselves.
good,The company has been ran by an owner with good timing for the industry it serves. 
good,Management expectations were high and kept changing therefore it made it difficult for me to complete projects. Its a corporate environment and most of the departments reports to international managers who did not understand the African culture and logistics.
good,There is a bunch of nit picking. Drama is a must or at least it seems that way. Management turnover. Barley get to know their names. After 15 years I'm on my way out. It was great in the beginning.
good,"A decent place to work. Decent pace, potential for overtime. TONS of drama, the amount was astounding to me. You can clearly tell who will advance and who won’t. It’s not about hard work or seniority, not experience. They play favorites and have no issue showing that. Lots of great, hardworking people there who have dedicated years of their lives to this company and have never moved from their starting point.  Besides the basic work, they expect a lot extra without any extra benefits. Expected to come up with ideas how to make them more money, basically. Such as improvements on safety, cost saving, quality, etc. , which affects your yearly raise if you don’t."
good,"Good quality of workers. Lack of equipment/print training and leadership by the company's supervisor. Limited focus and patience, very limited workspace for the size of projects and number of welders. Poor communication with management on quality and timeline of projects. However provides good catering for lunches often."
good,"It may purely depend on your field within Parker, but from what I've seen there is no real advancement. Not unless someone retires or quits. "
good,Corporate treats this division as a training ground for up and comer senior management.  The average longevity of a senior manager is about 2-3 years.  This makes it hard for the employees since they are wanting to make a name for themselves so to go on to something bigger and better.
good,"~Decent Salary"
good,I work in Product Assurance and have audited several to find that communication is non-existent and there is no connection between the first floor and the fourth. That is why they are losing money hand over fist in their controls biz. Thank goodness that they make a good actuator.
good,It was a time in my life where I needed a job and it filled the void. It was nothing to make a career out of.
good,"In a typical day, I was always on time - only missed when I had days added up on vacation days that I had to take or they would be taken from me.  I learned that you can work very hard for a company, always arrive early, work late and work extra days and they will still conspire to invent a reason to terminate you without valid reason."
good,"Excelente empresa, falta un poco mas de congruencia entre los valores y el equipo de trabajo."
good,"No advancement opportunities"
good,Very fast pace. Long hours. Computer systems are the worst I have encountered in many years. You have to go back to your DOS days and relearn. Way too many meetings
good,Use to a fast pace job. This was extremely slow. Management needs classes on how to deal with employees.  Also would help if they actually hired people as supervisors who actually did the job. Or at least has general knowledge of it.
good,"Worked like a dog 7 days a week 365 days a year. Had no life and was miserable. Trapped in a dead end job with no advancement unless you were in the ""goo ole boy"" club."
good,"the pay, benefits and bonuses are very good but the company is severely lacking in the areas of new hire training and poor treatment of associates by the management team."
good,"When I started as a temp back in 2015, everything was great. As my job progressed and my skills improved, the work environment did not. I was a temp for 8 months, despite being promised that I would be converted after 90 days. I was given an excuse stating that I wasn't working out and they wanted to keep me a temp for another thirty days, only to find out that after that thirty days there was a hiring freeze which kept up for another 5 months. When I was converted from a temp to a permanent position, my salary was not compensated nor was I given the option to discuss. When I moved to a new department, because I felt the department I was in was treating me unfairly due to nepotism, I quickly adapted, used knowledge that baffled the engineers, learned how to weld, became the lynch pin that made the department run and increased its productivity from one unit a month to four, and was repeatedly told I wasn't good enough by my superiors."
good,There was room to grow if you wanted to advance management wasn't the best but coworkers that I worked with was great very nice people.
good,There is obviously favoritism shown in the company and severe lack of holding appropriate people accountable for doing their jobs. Everyone was very nice to me however I saw that management had their favorite employees and did not care if it was obvious.
good,"Fellow associates were pleasant.  Company culture is difficult to address due to the the fact that I was hired as a contract employee, therefore not ""privy"" to company packages."
good,It is a good place to work .It is the people in mangement who do not step up to the plate become good leaders for theri team/peers.The most enjoyable part was learning new skills and ownership over the products that you contribute to building with your bare hands.I did not like the peer review I felt that a review should have been done by the team leader to be fair.
good,"Great place to work. Very laid back and the Manufacturing management was great. I loved working with all the employees and made some great friends. IT management was unavailable and provided no training for new technologies or job roles. My biggest lesson to take from this job is that I take care of the technology needs of the company and they, in turn, should invest in IT employees more."
good,"Walmart, Target, and Costco employee's make more than we do.For the work we do at Parker we are not paid very well. The company need to restructure the pay on the floor it's not competitive at all."
good,They work you like they want to. While management is off on weekend. Then management does not care that you have a family. As long as they require overtime. Now there is no overtimeci hear.
good,"Excellent Customer Service Team. Working at Parker Hannifin was an absolutely wonderful rewarding and fulfilling experience until July 10th, 2018 and then the world as we all knew it changed."
good,Great people to work with. Changes are promissed but take years to come to fruition. Management makes empty promises and has poor management skills. Great company to work for and you will be rewarded when you learn how to do your job in cpompletion after years of service.
good,"Typical work day is read emails respond to email check vacation request answer phone calls, drive to off site warehouse picking up part or dealing with employees, keeping all lines running"
good,It was a good place to work starting out and at the end of my assignment there was no work to be done. When there was work time flew by some parts were contaminated and therefore had to rejected.  One line ran bad rejected parts daily.
good,Management is poor and if you take an issue higher up it typically does not get resolved. H.R. likes to get an attitude with you about almost anything.
good,"Difficult to sustain one direction due to senior leadership turnover and changes in direction, leading to changes in staffing, teams, focused strategies, etc."
good,"Mainly endurance testing and data collection. Management was staffed with the wrong people."
good,"Work has slowed to a point where we havent had almost no advancemments in my department in over a year. The manager i have directly is very good and personable, yet the managers over mine are only about making cuts, yet it is taking the once abundant work, to almost none on a daily basis"
good,"I was responsible for receiving the incoming accounts receivables batches that were shipped by courier from the California company. Had to enter all daily time cards utilizing the Carms systems and print in company payroll every Thursday. I learned many different"
good,"The most enjoyable was my coworkers. This is all I am willing to share. From the time that I started with the company in 2012, Fluid Systems Div. was in a reduction in force mode."
good,"Advance product was bought out by Parker, they were in a hiring freeze.  Not much I could really say. They had a point system that I believe it would not had effected me"
good,"Parker has changed over the years.  Initially it was a great place to work.  The management had respect for employees and treated them well, like family."
good,"můj pracovní den je hodně stresový a hektický."
good,"Used to be a great company...."
good,I have enjoyed my 4 years in Parker. Overall good company to work for. I have learnt lot of good working practices in Parker. The hardest part of the job was no transparency from higher management. Most enjoyable part of the job is great team.
good,Machines are always breaking down which results in poor production times and a lot of stress. Works begins at 4:30 every morning 6 days of work and the conditions break down the body. I was injured on the job and have had to work on the floor with no assistance to help me deal with my injury. Far too many people are hired and quit---it is like a puppy mill and you never know who you are going to working with from day to day---most of the employees are untrained and struggle with getting to work on time an sober.
good,"Co- workers were fun to work with."
good,"a lot of packaging, loading and unloading. most of the other guys didn't speak english so that kinda made things a little more difficult but wasn't hard to work through"
good,Most days start off well but by the end of the day it gets kind of hectic. My Co Workers were great. I learned that honesty is not the best policy at parker. Most enjoyable part of my parker experience was having sundays off. The hardest part of my job was taking care of co workers who don't have determination to learn and keep up with what is going on.
good,es un ambiente agradable con maquinaria acorde a los requerimientos
good,Nice people lower  management is great  is the upper management  that seems to get a grip of things ok work environment can be a little boring at times very repeatable processes once u learn the job  you quickly  adjust  to anything else they teach  you. Great snack machine  small luch area could use a revamped
good,"If starting as a standard, non-management, non-engineer role:"
good,"This company is slightly inclusive. There is not a lot of representation of color across the board nor is there representation of women in charge. "
good,Great company for those who stay for 10 plus years. Advancement only available to those with long tenure. Very prescriptive corporate culture and little room to grow.
good,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation is a large company with locations around the world, and many thousands of employees. They have a policy of employee empowerment, which they are still in the process of fully implementing in some of their locations. The location where I worked was still near the beginning of the process, while other locations are much further along. If the corporate-led plan is ever fully implemented, it will be a great place to work. The pay is near the middle of industry standard. Benefits are a mixed bag, but overall offered a value which is slightly above industry standard."
good,"Committed to getting entire workforce involved in solving problems, employees expected to wear multiple hats, do 2-3 positions.  Difficult to accomplish job task with having to work multiple positions."
good,"Lavoro stimolante con una buona retribuzione,peccato per il personale che si mette in competizione mettendo in cattiva luce gli interinali Se vuoi stare alla Parker devi essere raccomandato"
good,People aren't very nice here. Workers discriminate alot. You  can get fired if you miss too much days. Not good training provided to you because they don't have professional people to train you. Preference for workers they do have it in this place.
good,"If you're looking for a place to flourish and grow, you might have your chance here."
good,"The management is a little disoriented as to employee job descriptions and responsibilities. Employees have to have incentive to perform assigned tasks. Lack of leadership  leaves employees to interrupt objectives. No mentoring for junior engineers available, just pass downs causing some  confusion."
good,"Its a good place, you must have high attention to details good additional benefits that are not common to benefits package. Hard to get off second shift"
good,"I worked here between 2017-2018 and enjoyed it 90% of the time."
good,"Training was minimal. It was a sink or swim kind of scenario, they keep pushing people through the training without sufficient knowledge and expect them to know how to do things safely."
good,"Extremely poor management who had little to no experience in managing the area of their responsibility. Generally, people talk behind your back. No sense of team work at all. Management doen't care if you do a great job, the pay attention to if you use your cell phone more than you should regardless of your performance. I hate it the place, couldn't wait to leave."
good,"The only way to move up within Parker is to relocate. They do not value or promote younger employees, despite experience. Preference is given to ages 45+ in upper management roles."
good,Company lacks staff size needed to perform daily job task. Not willing to invest in getting more help causing others to do more with less. No job advancement opportunities. Mature workforce. Low morale.Can't seem to get the workers on board.
good,"Horrible work/life balance. At parker Hannifin Chetek, the ""culture"" is not, that you work to live. The so called ""culture"" is actually you live to work. Bad reputation. Bad employees get praise, whilst good employees constantly get the shaft."
good,Parker used to be a wonderful company to work for. With the recent management change employees are no longer valued and cared about like were once before.
good,Busy all day. I learned a lot about building harnesses. Management has favorites. Too much drama. Doing the work of 3 people. Some of the friendships.
good,"Poor management, poor growth, good benefits, Fair work scedule, I think its a good place to work but I feel unsafe as far as where the business is going in the future."
good,Yes you get great benefits but no family life unless you work in the office. During peak season if you work in assembly you work 10 hour a day 5 days a week and you work 8 hours on Saturday. Machine operators work 7 days a week just about all year round.
good,"bad management but nice work environment . learn how to work in hot plants culture, learn about 5s plus s. Parker could improve in alot of area due in management, other than that its a good place to start"
good,Can make a living not a killing.  Work moved to China.  Some opportunity for overtime.  No real chance to advance.  Hire young people to management positions without any experience.
good,Pay is pretty good.  Benefits are expensive.  Overtime is mandatory.  Job security is questionable.  Most of the jobs are easy but demanding.
good,Overall good company to work for.  They should work on helping individuals progress towards their goals.  You wear many hats so you dive right into problem solving with a cross functional team which gives you a better understanding of the business.
good,Empresa em fase de reformulação. Muitos Cargos foram fechados outros agregados em outras divisões.
good,"Great co-workers, Clean efficient place to work but constant  management team turnover and not entirely fair group to work with.- needs improvement."
good,Contracted at Parker so I was not part of the internal work culture. Operates like a big company with very little culture.
good,are You Kidding Me!!!!!! This place was a 3 Ring Circus. I can't believe that management was given the freedom to Run This place into the ground. Worked there for 4 years . Laid off 3 Times . Think I finally got a clue.. Learned many different sections . I pride myself as a quick learner. That was probably the only saving grace. I love to multitask.  The people there for the most part are great. Really not much on job security.
good,"This company offered a lot of things for me, however most of which required extra time off the clock to participate. Which meant more time away from my family without compensation. What I gathered from this was that, if I had been more involved I would have advanced much faster ""up the latter"" due to my willingness to be at work for nothing."
good,"long hours, management is never on the same page. good benefits, safety incentives were good before new management took over. safety lunches are still available, clean factory."
good,The last couple of years there were awful. This company is definitely going downhill fast. Watched it go from a very progressive company to one that is trailing their customers.
good,The department I worked for gave me no opportunity for advancement and goals were a moving target.  Accountly mistake left employees responsible for two years of retroactive taxes of benefits.
good,"•	Kept record of units handled or moved, using daily production sheets or work tickets."
good,ran different machines for coolant systems. assembled parts too.
good,worked as temp and got laid off. Not bad work but higher management doesn't care about temps.
good,"Long hours with minimum compensation, still going through going pains from an acquisition where I worked"
good,The kitchen was a nice size but very old. Didn't really have management. Employee morale was very low.
good,"you load parts into a machine ones the cycle is complated you take them out and you may have to some things on to the part like a lable or plugs, then you would have to pack into the box and ship it. the hardest part was learning how to read differnt blue prints. wthe most ienjoyable is that i can do the work under presure for a dead line to meet.the people i work was very nice most of the time. but we all have are bad days. the mangement did not inter act with the employes as much as the us to when i first started working their"
good,"Beginning of the shift, we would give turn overs and discuss any problems, if any. We would preform a lot of electrical work, and you had to be able to work and think on your own at times. I enjoyed working here becouse of the daily challenges that you may be faced with."
good,Aprendi a reconhecer a importância de uma equipe unida e o valor do cliente.
good,I loved the job but when it all came down to it they disrespected me by calling me a liar when i told the truth about absolutely everything. I learned alot in 2 years i worked in the CNCs i also worked on the reillos. The place its self had made me a better person all in all.
good,"Struggling Industry, dedication to worker well-being is inconsistent, top heavy management. Safety on the shop floor was a concern. Froward thinking with regard to customer and FAA requirements was lacking."
good,It was a good place to work just not enough hours did a lot of stuff there and moved around just couldn’t count on your hours or if they was gonna lay you off the next day or not
good,"Too many meetings, management completely disconnected from the assemblers, machinists, and day to day struggles of all employees.  Meetings about meetings.  Set up to fail."
good,Heavy reliance on work-from-home within team meant that no one is available and priorities are not work related. This is done so everyone is expected to be available 24/7/365.
good,"Don't get me wrong my first year at parker was awsome. The hours worked really well with my schedule at the time. Lots of over time back then also. But here recently i noticed alot of favoritism tward certain employees with the leads and some supervisors. The management is a joke, orders getting re-ran, pasted up and ran last minute and also lots of drama."
good,"There is plenty of work to do at Parker Aerospace due to their military and commercial mix as well as the current ""super cycle"" of aircraft manufacturing we're in. Plenty of room for advancement including tuition reimbursement. Although most things are standardized across their site around the world, each site is slightly run differently (management styles, level of empowerment, 5/40 vs 9/80 work weeks, etc)."
good,The ladies I worked with were nice and would always converse when working together. The work wasn't difficult and we got to sit while we worked. Everyday we would switch jobs so we weren't always doing thur same tasks.
good,Benefits are good and that's how they get you poor management with little respect. You dont get promoted if you are to valuable where you are. They talk about safety until you get hurt and then they do everything they can to make it your fault so there hands are clean.
good,"I needed something while going back to school, and boy did a find a job... Low pay, hard work, long hours, stressful coworkers and managers. Sometimes I would have to work outside in the sun for hours, mandatory with pants, using old and slow tools because of budget concerns. It is almost impossible to advance. There were a couple of a good coworkers that you could possibly engage in thoughtful conversation with for a few minutes out of the day. That was about it. The fact that I was a temporary employee for two years with no real benefits or raises made it terrible. I'm glad I'm finally done with my degree and moving forward, hopefully never to be in a position like that again."
good,Productive fun workplace with ping pong table.  Steady work with endless amount of overtime hours.  Management is poor and lacks an understanding of work life balance. Employees not well represented by the HR department.
good,"I would rather not say too much about working here at this time.  I believe in not saying anything, if your responses are negative."
good,The company seemed to not be able to function as it needed because they would constantly have the employees working overtime. I even heard from some of the workers that the company had them doing overtime for a few years straight.
good,"Company has good benefits such as medical, vacation and 401K. However, the working environment here is not good. "
good,Very poor management. A lot of mandatory overtime because management doesn't know how to plan anything around there. Not much opportunity for advancement. Never know where you are going to be working at which may be good for some people who like to move around. Company is moving Illinois. All the plants seems to slowly be shutting down and moving production to Mexico.
good,"High turn over rate, management comes in and out constantly, mandatory overtime, no room for a family or social life. Working 50-56 hours per week. Would not recommend if you have young children."
good,want a lot of work done but with very few people highly encourage to work Saturday only three days off a year. Lack of proper functioning tooling for certain repairs
good,work was hard its very dirty in the building I worked in. Its hot. For the most part the hourly employees get along. Management is not the most trusting people. The benifits are very good they have taken care of my family well.
good,"Overall it is not a bad company to work for. Management sets priorities fairly well but then pulls out any support to assist in accomplishing goals. Benefits are decent, pay could be better."
good,"Management was very adamant about keeping traditional processes for our department. A lot of what needed to be done was messy and was tedious. If you enjoy traditional roles and a typical 8-hour shift, then this is the place for you."
good,The direction of the company is leaning towards a decline. There needs to be a review of the key management individuals and hold them accountable on any misgivings.
good,The company and improve and become better if management listened more to employees. Some management people need to leave. Need to make employees feel more involved and get their ideas on subjects.
good,"I've seen people laid off here with very little warning. Many of the full time employees here have a very negative opinion of contractors. As a contractor, you'll be walking on egg-shells at times. I've experienced some of the most unprofessional behavior here, such as full time employees cursing at colleagues or threatening to get less experienced engineers fired. Getting to know your HR representative is essential for working here."
good,"Parker Hannifin is an okay place to work. The people are very nice. Parker, specifically the division I work in has an identity issue. The management are more concerned with their own positioning within the company than their responsibility to the employees."
good,"I typically do the same job every day. I've learned about the process of forming filter elements. The job is actually really easy, I found no complications in learning their processes. I like working on my own, and while I operate a forming machine that is exactly how I spend my day. I don't have a problem working with others, if I need to collaborate, I'm willing and able to do so."
good,It is a good company but it takes to long to get hired in the company. i learned howto use calipers and management is nice. co workers are nice. nothing really. easy work.
good,"This was a contract job building a large iron bird.  It was challenging build a large and complex system.  I learned a great deal about ARINC 429 communication, reflected memory, and fpga."
good,Everyday its a challenge to solve professional engineers problems to benefit their work and production. I learned excellent skills as an engineer and co-workers were great to work with.
good,"My day doing this job was to input the work orders and preventive maintenance work orders into the program. I ordered parts for equipment and inventory and kept up with the demand of getting the parts in.  I worked with the maintenance personnel, maintenance supervisor, process engineers and other personnel to find parts for the equipment, did reports on downtime of equipment and trying to get the PMs done in a timely manner for the equipment and molds making the parts.  I worked with Excel spreadsheets in doing reports, as requested. The most enjoyable part of doing this job was working with the maintenance personnel, maintenance supervisor, and other personnel in the plant.  I, also, enjoyed working with the vendors coming in to get the parts in and finding hard to find parts. The hardest part was trying to get parts in a timely manner.  I learned a lot in the 16+ years doing this job."
good,Not sure what to say. Good company to work for. Just did not provide the career i was looking for.
good,"A typical day for me was to assist others in getting their job done, when I wasn't working on my own issues."
good,"bonne coordination de l'équipe"
good,Worked there as a temp for 8 months and let go without any notice even though I had been praised by management for my job performance.
good,"poste stressant,collaborateurs sympas mais bcp de pression"
good,"it is a good first job for young adults to get a head start."
good,"Overall a good company if you work for a key business area. If management has decided not to focus on your business division, they will pull funding and let it die."
good,"The workplace culture wasn't too inviting, the management was pretty strict on little things, such as being a minute late or having to stay for a few extra minutes to finish things without being able to leave on time."
good,"The location was full of great people working together, however the level of growth for career advancement  not there. The job responsibilities do not align with the opportunities,"
good,"Parker was a better place to work. With management changing so often, it is hard to meet the ever changing expectations. Profit is the bottom line. Overall, a decent company."
good,"The pay is good and commensurate with local and national pay. However, Upper Division, Group and Corporate Management cares little for the health or well being of their personnel. Local management does care about their people, but can only do so much under the corporate crunch and strangling of an already sparsely oiled Lean culture. There must be a cultural awakening or they will continue to struggle to keep good talent. There are many long term employees here that were here before the massive layoff in 2002 & 2003. However, they now struggle to keep most of the brightest and talented. This is the rule, but there are many exceptions since there are some whom have recently been hired and continue to struggle through the rollercoaster of hiring frenzies then mass lay offs and most that stay are locals."
good,"Working for Parker allows you to learn multiple job duties at competitive pay.  Job perks include adequate vacation days, paid holidays and quarterly bonuses."
good,Was good in beginning towards the end terrible was not the job for me used forklift worked in every department ended in receiving put product away picked shipped also worked in aerospace
good,"Poorly managed and not pleasant to work for. I don't recommend anyone to work there. Managers were overly demanding, unhelpful and un-supportive. Injury was frequent and the company would not help. Heavy lifting of extremely hot parts. Benefits were good"
good,I did not receive any formal training and all of my actions were always questioned. There was a lot of back-stabbing and undermining that occurred to keep certain people in their positions.
good,"I cannot remember what my day was like at this job."
good,"management is the problem, not a career company, internal jobs opening are fake, management has not clue of the production and people are working really hard"
good,Third Shift definitely took its toll on me an my family. Being that I worked for a temp agency I would have figured they would have game me more direction of what they wanted accomplished.
good,"Management could use improvement, but it was not a bad place to work. Quarterly bonuses gave you something to look forward to. As professionals, having flexible hours would be ideal."
good,If you  take  management  out of the situation  at parker it's a good  place to  work! Paid vacation  and they try to  work with  employees  needs! People are  awesome  to  work with!
good,"restructuration in the company made the atmosphere very special "
good,"Management is expected to work casual overtime on a regular basis.  The work/life balance leaves something to be desired.  The ""Lean"" activities are modified from the foundational teachings to create a method of reducing the work force."
good,The management is always changing. The current manager does not like confrontation and will avoid it at all cost. No one is held accountable for anything except for missing work. Reviews are always late and HR functions are not complete. Schedule is not accurate all the time.
good,"Manager over critical -- If he/she did not like you, then you were made to pay so to speak. Given bad review even though work was satisfactory.  Work flow given to others then criticized for not doing enough when you did not have the opportunity to perform to expectation."
good,"This use to be a fun and good company. The new managers have taken so much from the workers there. They have favorites and watch over the workers as if they are in daycare. The HR there has no respect for any workers on the floor. They have a handbook and steady make up rules as they go. The corporate office in Ohio pretty much back them because they are a big bread winner in the industry. Yes the company makes good profits and money. It is not because of the management, but because of the workers who put in countless hours. Most workers are broken down and almost forced to do so. I damaged both of my hands while working there. I was forced to leave because they wouldnt work with me. They HR told me after my injury that “ maybe this aint the job for you. “  I worked their for 7 years."
good,Do not work there. Hr has resources that you will never believe.  Like I said hr manager runs that place and it's her rules no matter what. Had good maint dept until hr and upper management got to crazy so I had no choice but to throw in the towel.  And I've heard lately it's gotten worse
good,My experience with Parker was good i enjoyed the hour  and the people that i work with. I had a chance to learn different jobs so that i might could advance in one day with a little more training the management was not that great but we had a job to do regardless..the work culture could have been a little better  but through it all it was fair.there was not any thing that was so hard about any of the jobs if you was train right. I guess i can say for the most of us that the short time that we work for this company is that the most enjoyable was when we had a chance to enjoy some time off to be with family because sometime we put in a lot of hours.
good,"Certain people in management do not tell the truth. Each location is very independent, trying to transfer to another Parker location is extremely difficult.  Pays well but no career advancement opportunities. Even with further education you won't see promotions."
good,"Everyone knows their job and does it to the best of their ability and if not we work through whatever problem that is encountered, whether it be work related or personal."
good,Clean work environment but poor management. They do not hire the staff who work through the temporary agency.  The mistakes made on the line are blamed on the temp workers.
good,"Working at Helac / Parker was basically a repetitive job. Nothing too hard once you get trained and work on your own. My coworkers were very entertaining and helpful while working If trying to grow and work your way up the ladder in positions within the Company, this is not the job to work for. Even with that being said, working for Helac / Parker was still a great experience."
good,Fun work place. Supervisor are open minded plenty of over time because of machinery is outdated. The demand for this product is high and sometimes supervisors put a lot of pressure on workers.But we get the job done.
good,"I loved my job and enjoyed being around the majority of my coworkers. However, they slowly added more responsibility until I was overworked and underpaid. If pay reflected the responsibility, I'd still be there."
good,Parker was a good place to work for many years. Other locations may still be. The Mishawaka facility is on hard times and the employees are under stress. Management of the facility is not local.
good,"Head strong upper Management Team."
good,Inconsistent with daily duties and no training method. Everyone is brought in and put to work without a correct way of training and then held responsible for any errors made.
good,A good thing about working in this company is that you can make a lot of money by working overtime. Work schedule is from Monday through Friday with Saturdays being optional.
good,Parker have great people to work with and makes the days by. Management can sometimes be a problem as they don't help fellow employees strive for success. Parker seems to hold employees back from advancing in their careers.
good,A typical day in Chennai office would be just fine. the work culture is good. Sometimes workdays extend to multiple weeks without a weekly-off.
good,"The division is run out of a remote location, leaving less feel of ownership.  People at the site are great, but outside influences effect people.  Location is always in flux with personell due to restrictions of head count & work life balance."
good,"Die Kollegen waren super. Der Job war eine Herausforderung. Zu viele Köche verderben den Brei!!! Das Management besteht aus lauter Einzelkämpfer und dadurch haben Sie eine gute Firma, die unter Hoerbiger immer positive Zahlen geschafft hat, zerlegt und zugesperrt."
good,"Due to amount of ongoing projects, The Parker Company requires more resources to work on. "
good,"Ho confermato le mie conoscenze."
good,There are definitely improvements that need to be made and there are plenty of opportunities to make them.  People here understand change is needed and are willing to help.
good,I enjoyed my position with this company a lot-unfortunately through down sizing and restructuring I could not be retained as an employee.
good,"1. Working Environment is good."
good,"Drove a box truck to all 4 plants in the area .Also loaded and unloaded the truck With hand truck "
good,"Meu dia até o dia da demissão foi muito bom."
good,Hög belastning inom ett intressant område med möjlighet till intern utbildning och resor i tjänsten.
good,"Sales vs Manufacturing = no growth of business"
good,"Very flexible schedule and some great team leaders.  The good team leaders would love to help you grow, however the company is very limited in opportunities.  The compensation is okay but people coming from other companies are often paid more than the tenured employees.  Co-workers are great, however there is some animosity because there is not fair treatment within the organization"
good,Parker was a good place to work.   People are great to work with and their are some really good workers out there.  Benefits good and really enjoyed my job.  Working long hours was quite typical for a lot of divisional employees.
good,"If you live in the Richland area it is a decent job, would not drive more than 30 min to work there.  The pay was a little on the low side and merit increases were disappointing.  Likely because Parker's general policy for recent hires and due to the type of higher volume low cost catalogue product made in Richland.  This division is working on changing that with customer driven product, automotive, agricultural, military, etc. The benefits are average and total compensation is ""competitive"" for Richland.  Some of the managers are not very good at their jobs, lack of experience is a major factor.  You can expect to work well over 40 hours on salary to meet their expectations."
good,"There were no typical days, everything was pretty hectic at all times.  The work was enjoyable and useful for gaining experience quickly.  I enjoyed my projects, but could have used more direction and a more controlled work environment."
good,"Early start times usually 5 am until 3:30 pm with very fast paced work culture and much importance place on procedures."
good,"Todos los colaboradores realizan sus tareas de forma normal y en un entorno de trabajo agradable y tranquilo para llevarloa cabo, el crecimiento laboral se ve un poco en vias de crecimiento."
good,Parker was an ok place to work for the limited time I was there. It was clean and the management wasn't to bad either. A lot of the cooworkers would backstab and tell on you although for no reason at all. Overall pretty laid back place except for your own coworkers mostly.
good,Fast paced work environment - very challenging. Company does not care about the employees as much as they care about their bottom-line. Management condones hostility and bullying by supervisors to lower level employees. Some in management do not have College degrees...
good,"réglage et production sur machine à bobiner, utilisation divers postes de travail sur l'atelier."
good,"Altijd wat te doen, veel geleerd"
good,"Stage réalisé au sein de l'entreprise de Nivelles."
good,"Working on the floor, you have to stand up all day long. We only got 30min lunches and 10 min breaks. Free ice cream on the first break only. The had me working as a water spider getting parts and printouts for the machinists. There was no advancement for temps and only perm. employees get the health benefits and can work on the machines."
good,"Primeiro trabalho administrativo, deu oportunidade de conhecer processos, procedimentos, trabalho individual e em equipe."
good,"Hours were ok, good place to start, but no room for advancement."
good,Meet great people that worked there. the work is very easy and non complex
good,I learned a lot and had advancement opportunities. There is definitely a lot tied to who you know and if they “like” you or not. Not a bad place to get started and learn about the industry.
good,Era ótimo lugar só que eu trabalhei terceirizado pela agencia isso não me agrado se não até estava até lá até hoje
good,"High volume precision engineering manufactured to often unrealistic targets. "
good,Come to work sometimes conflict with supervisor other than that i came in did my job and went home. Hard part was career progression there was none felt like a number.
good,"I had worked at this job for about 2 years and it has been excellent work hours and benefits. Communication was up to par though, there were little complications, my overall experience have been impactful."
good,entreprise tres propre recyclage  collegues sympa tres bonne acceuil
good,Downside- Lots of overtime required due to volume of work.  Not good from a work life balance perpective.  Upside- Good cafeteria that had a talented cooking staff.
good,"Parker was a good company to work for.  I appreciated working with the local team members in Moncks Corner.  The Sr. Leaders in OH were a bit disconnected.  They had high expectation, but little support for the local team to meet those expectations."
good,"Nice building. Okay wages, a bit above average. Good hours."
good,work on cnc machine made part for air units clean place worked second shift till they closed down likeable atmosphere operated fort lift sometime to get parts
good,"Basically Parker Hannifin sets you an assignment to complete within 6 months and hangs you out to dry, with no management or direction within that time."
good,"Pay isn't commensurate with skill sets required. No sick days are allocated to the blue collar employees. If you get sick and need to take time off, your option is to take an unpaid day or to use a vacation day. Not a place that affords much upward mobility to a white collar position. "
good,I loved my job but i was hired on through temp and my job ended. I really don’t have much to say. I would love to get hired on through the company but as I stated I was through temp
good,It's a great job for a single person  a lot of hours 6 days  a week. No time for family....    But the company does take care of it's employees benefits are great....
good,"A typical day would be to send for outside process to suppliers. "
good,"A place with interesting products, mostly good employees, in a good facility, with a known reputation in the industry.  The greatest stumbling block was the loyal employees attached to the company from the original inventor of the product.  As a family owned mom and pop shop prior to corporate purchase, the long standing employees took great advantage of very good and trusting management along with a bullying mentality towards selective employees who were not long tenured."
good,"Parker is a stable place for employment.  However for advancement movement and relocation inside the company is required.  Without multiple locations on job history the employee is limited in advancement.   It is possible to be inside of the organization without the correct requirements to advance and limited availability to acquire the needed experience, essentially dead heading career advancement.   "
good,"I've worked for this company going on eight years now. Started as a temp who only crimped parts and worked my way up to full time employee who runs all machines and programs in my department.  Loved the job for many years till company started going downhill.  The training was never what it should have been for such a large and successful company but it has gotten so much worse to the point of almost barely any training of new hires at all.  Rapidly losing employees with so much job knowledge due to retirement but not preparing for replacements and transfer of knowledge.  The worst part of the job is never seeing your family and the feeling that management  cares nothing for your family or life outside the company. If you are sick or have emergency you get points, they don't honor doctor excuse for days off due to sickness. Went from working some Saturdays and ten hour days to working Saturdays and Sundays  every week and ten hour days through the week. You get exhausted and stressed out and they still expect so much"
good,Safety is a number one priority but sometimes the safety procedures implemented hinder more than help you. Management does its best to keep employees informed of how the business is doing.
good,Had a great time working as a contractor for parker.  limited jobs for admin and office personnel.  Worked for a year and a half and was denied opportunities to become full time employee.  Was told I would be made permanent and they never did.  Management changes a lot. The manufacturing employees where awesome.
good,i liked working there for the most part. it was just hard when you work in a position where you were on constant watch and was allowed limited interaction with your other co workers.
good,Ineffective centralized management creates a culture of apathy.  Antiquated business systems causes many business disruptions.  Generic Lean principles that are universally applied do not always result in positive results.
good,I was happy while I worked at Parker; we had a great Accounting team; unfortunately our Accounting department was outsourced which meant no more work for a few of us in within the department.
good,"An excellent place to work"
good,"If management were to take care of & address the minor, concerns, this can/could be an awesome place of employment. Because I was Productive and happy"
good,Parker is a very challenging and also fun place to work in. The broad product base and different types of customers with different needs keep you learning more about the industry.
good,The company needs better benefits. They currently purchased Clarcor and the integration has not been as smooth as it could have been.  It will be a great company to work for once Parker has fully integrated.
good,"Great benefits (like tuition reimbursement program, dental and medical insurance, 401K matching contributions).  Parker Hannifin has an on-site cafeteria and gym."
good,"Your peers along with management you couldn't trust. Everyone talked behind each others back. Your peers limited your chance for advancement. The hardest part about the job was the cut throat environment and just trying to get along with your peers. The most enjoyable part of the job was every few months we would have an employee down day that included games, food and activities."
good,"The company is ok but being a woman some of the boxes were too heavy weighing forty five pounds to over a hundred pounds my wrist still hurts after two months of not working there, I signed up for second shift but they would force us to come in two hours early but we would get done early, the co workers were ok just need to be careful what you say around some people you do have the typical rats that go run and tell on you. I guess the job is ok if you can handle heavy products and like working in a warehouse with no a/c in the summer time."
good,"busy, fast paced job must multitask. Good hours a lot of overtime. Everybody is nice and friendly. Can be a little demanding at times but your team always helps each other to complete each task on time."
good,Benefits profit sharing and a gym membership for their employees.  Co-workers pleasure to work with.  Management had a definite impact on employee moral.
good,"I have like to work more freedom give us for work responsiblity ."
good,"Opportunity to learn different aspects of manufacturing support including shipping/receiving, tow motor operation, industrial painting, and assembly.  Good medical insurance and retirement."
good,Trabajo continuo bajo presion pero buen ambiente laborar y prestaciones.
good,"A typical day at work is internal customer service. Attending meetings in order to support Project teams with deliverables and their data configuration. Take care of external Coordination memos of the business teams supported. Ensure we follow internal procedures and best practices when it comes to delivering data to our suppliers/customers. Participate in High performance team meetings in order to improve infrastructure processes, etc."
good,"Empresa muito boa de trabalhar, clima muito bom entre os funcionários e muito espirito de equipe, mais a Parker pecava um pouco sobre as escolhas de promoções a funcionários e também não fornecia PLR a todos da empresa."
good,"If you like working at a large corporation that's bottom line is always how does this affect the stock price, then you would enjoy working here.  It is a mostly male dominated industry with very few women in managerial or director roles.  People toil away for over 20 years to make manager.  If you are young and quick, you can advance to these roles in half the time.  The compensation is on the low side of average.  There are full benefits and various work-place programs.  Overtime is often not expected and most people that work at this company are clock punchers.  Some of the leaders are willing to teach you and mentor you and do value you.  Unfortunately, a lot of others are just waiting around for their pension to kick-in and have no interest in advancing the company or bringing it into the 21st century."
good,I learned a lot of useful information that U can use in future positions
good,I worked on the toughtest line to work on in the entire plant and guess what I kicked its butt but it was pretty difficult.
good,Good work culture.
good,"The only problem I experienced with this company was their propensity for hiring arrogant no nothings. Not talking about the management here, more like a single low level employee thinks he knows a thing or two and causes his team to have poor production and high scrap. He did this because he thought he was above the work instructions that were provided for him to do his job by FAA standards. He also had the audacity to throw his teammates under the bus despite causing the problems himself. when someone called him out for his poor workmanship he would run to HR saying they were discriminating against him."
good,Loved my job. Gained valuable work and skills experience. Great hours and schedule. Flexible and understanding supervisory staff. They were great to work with.
good,Too few resources to resolve the ongoing problems in organization. More technical resources are required to to keep up with the growth and changes within the business.
good,It’s a good job only if ur into that environment . Bad part is the hours sometimes they will want you to work all week and people would get tired of not having a break
good,Safety is the culture and they far exceed it.Great benefit package. Reasonable starting pay. This company is really good at trying to get the employee moral up.
good,Overwhelmed and underpaid - kept adding to my workload until I could not do anything more .I was totally stressed out most of the time. Worked many weekends and very few holidays for benefits...
good,"Decent place to work. "
good,"Highly recommended. reasonable pay worth the hours and time. Very hands on, great and understanding with their employees. A laid back environment with easy tasks."
good,"Moved away . I dont care ..........."
good,"El trabajo es sencillo y monótono, buen trato con los compañeros."
good,It was a easy job the managers jus sometimes made it difficult the pay is horrible coming through a temp service .. long hours with less pay I made my 90 probation and I still didnt get full time
good,Good company great inviorment loved my job loved my morning shift five am to one thirty pm had almost all my tools and parts to assemble my units for John deer and Volvo.
good,"Great place to work using on the latest aerospace technology, innovative thinking and great communications.  Direct hire employees are treated fairly and challenged to integrate their technology into customer aircrafts."
good,Minding your business and doing your job. Do your job and stay busy and not into other departments talking or using cell phones on the floor. Mainly just come in and stay in your area and do your work assigned to you.
good,I heard a from people who work at Parker for many years that environment and overall are not the same as it used to be 15 years and before that. Good people left which is sad but business is still alive and going strong but not strongest as I thought. Parker needs a changing plan.
good,"Salario bueno , por encima del promedio y con oportunidades de desarrollo hacia diferentes departamentos"
good,They brought in portable AC units but it was still very hot on the floor. It was a good company to work for with plenty of Ot on the weekend if you'd like to do that.
good,"Highly transactional.  Unable to comprehend and do root cause analysis resulting in unresolved issues.  Hiring has also been suffering as a result of improper screening,"
good,Overall great job if you are the right fit. They tend to hire people for positions and if they are not liked they get treated badly until they quit or prove their worth.
good,I thinking that Parker is a good place to work. The people there are great to get along with. They like to promote with the Company. I think people thought try to work there.
good,Company went through multiple changes due to corporate and economical environments.  I enjoyed my colleagues but we were typically under stress and sense of urgency.  Opportunities for growth were very limited and performance reviews (although scoring high and meeting goals and developing processes) the salaries were not sufficient to today's cost of living increases.
good,The people are nice to work with. It’s not a hard job it’s a lot of Repetitious work . They offer a lot of overtime they mandate us often. But overall it nice
good,"Hired as contract machinist, not a good environment for getting hired on permanently. Never give you a straight answer on any questions you may have, and after working there for almost 2 years you never seem to be part of the company workforce."
good,ok place to work if you are the kind of that doesn't want to work to hard. they try to train you in decent amount of time so you can do your job safely and do it right
good,"A company devoted to quality and new product advancement, present in multiple industries including industrial controls, hydraulics and medical. The company is always looking at process improvement, employee safety, employee empowerment and premier customer service."
good,Work environment was good and stress level related to any Aerospace company. Work life balance was good. Only issue was that there were a several management changes in a short period of time.
good,"I work hard and long hours but frankly I enjoy doing so. Everyday I learn something new from others or the job itself. I enjoy the challenge of the job and truly don't mind managing my team, what I don't like are stubborn and arrogant managers that they believe in their ""way or the highway"". The hardest part of the job is explaining to headquarter in CA, what we go through everyday to hit our customer commitment and goals. They are truly disconnected."
good,The company lacks consistency in keeping new employes in longer than 1 month. The turn around is bad at times. The machines need to be updated to work correctly.
good,"Enjoyed the people who do the work. Management, not as much... Parker isn't a bad place, exactly, but it was just a job. Didn't see much opportunity to advance, either"
good,Ótima empresa só deve tomar cuidado com as gerências daí muita panela..só são bons com as meninas que eles querem...ok
good,"Estágio de Administração, numa empresa Multinacional na área Mecânica. Uma bela estrutura, organizada, porém na época do término do estágio de quase dois anos, não era possível a efetivação."
good,The job itself is fun. The processes and all are very simple. However there is a extreme lack of communication. Managers in my personal experience on my shift are not concerned about employees needs only thing they care about it quantity of pieces built. No matter the issues that you may face your effeciency score is affected and your constantly down talked for poor efeenciancy. My training was fairly medioker and unrelated this to managers and now re training was done. However there is plenty of hours to work the benefits are great pay is highly competitive.
good,Sempre está com problemas de qualidade e de entrega do produto.
good,"Parker hannifin is a good place to work. I worked on an assembly line, assembling hydraulic guages for pumps. I worked there for few weeks. I got laid off for not showing up to work on time."
good,There is a major management issue  I was told one thing by one person then another person would tell me I should be doing something different just a mess
good,Fast paced work environment.  Not always sure of what work is expected of you each day. Can be a challenging job at times. Not everyone is held to the same standards.
good,"More focused on getting work completed but does not have training for their complex computer systems. A lot of pressure from management to catch up on work when some employees knowingly do not carry their own weight, so it falls on ones who do timely work. Some other employees like to tell you what to do or may ne rude and not addressed about their behavior even if management knows. Very unprofessional and do not care about what is going on in your personal life but will act like it. Mandatory over time even though upon hire and the job description do not require it, usually about 6 hours a week working extra hours. Great benefits and pay but only worth it if you like dancing with the devil!"
good,What a awesome place to work. Co-workers were very friendly and easy to get alone with.  I enjoyed the location as well as the hours. will go back if I was able to.
good,"Overall Good and Hardworking people"
good,"It's been a great place to work. Flexible hours for Engineers. Team work environment. It is a small place <60 people, but everyone are well known, good collaborations working environment."
good,Excellent team. Professional place. Very Ethical. Excellent place to follow procedures. taking care of costumer specifications. Very clean place. excellent management.
good,"Empresa muito boa, funcionários bem engajados, porém, algumas pessoas que não estão de acordo com a cultura da empresa e estão em cargos de liderança onde não tem a capacidade para liderar e acabam desmotivando colaboradores."
good,Good place to work if you don’t have any young kids. They have good pay to start out. I only ever had a problem with one worker. They won’t let you bid out of a department until you have been there for a year.
good,upon there take over of our company. they was wanting to clear everybody out of there. it was a good company and good leaders after they came in an seen how it was making the kind of money for a little company. had good leaders but the pay was really not good but it payed the bills.
good,I was a summer accounting intern for Parker Hannifin. i never felt like I was actually part of the company and I never felt that I was important to my manager. I ended up being a glorified Accounts Payable lady who had to do the grunt work that no one else wanted to do.
good,"I enjoyed working here. Very relaxed atmosphere. I didn't agree with the way some of the practices, but overall a good place to work. Wasn't trained in other areas of the plant which i think would be a benefit to the company."
good,"Parker is a organization which is very diversified with numerous products and markets served.  Therefore, it has been able to withstand economic ups and downs without significant impacts,"
good,"team mates are awesome, management non-existence, poor communication skills between shifts. Shift different pay not enough, some people pulled their weight while others skate by."
good,My mother was sexually harassed. So instead of doing anything they fired her and had a meeting about how you shouldn't harass anyone.So i quit and slowly all my friends have been fired as the met there hiring date.
good,"The lower supervisors were outstanding, while the uppers didn't understand what was going on out on the floor.  They kept shortening the deadlines, making it almost impossible to complete orders."
good,High volume production of fairly technical designs; older equipment but with a very loyal and tenured non-union work environment. Fun people to work with positive affirmation. It was a fun place to work at
good,Most workers were temp members so there was a lot of turnover.  Most were good workers.  The work was not hard.  The people were knowledgeable and easy to train.
good,Parker great job would had love to stay there but it was through a temp service but people was good and it was reasonable pay and work hours was good and reasonable
good,Its been a while since I worked at Parker. At the time I worked there the people were really nice and friendly. They were very willing to work with me since I was still in school. Overall a good place to work.
good,Worked at Parker for over three years and enjoyed it more often than not. I worked closely with a few engineers and technicians to problem some assemblies. I personally had no big issues with working with this company. The minor disputes I have had in the past is what would be considered normal.
good,Parker is a good place to work. The warehouse lead is the best Lead there could ever be.  He made coming to work a pleasure.  The only negative thing i could think of is that upper management does not give enough recognition to us little folks.  They need to give raises  on a regular schedule.  Some employees who have been there for 8+ years have not received a raise in over 4 years. And he is already not making enough anyways.  Somebody who does 5 peoples jobs when they are only getting paid for 1 is totally unfair.
good,"The greatest part of this job was that once you had understood the written instructions or work brief, and were able to follow the written instructions, you were left alone to get on with the job at hand without having someone stand over your shoulder. The only time some one would come and speak with you was if there was an out of spec variance in what you were making or you found a problem that was causing the product to be out of spec. The management and engineers worked with you to rectify the issue."
good,Job was not challenging just had a hard time with advancement. The management was good and the workflow was distributed evenly. I enjoyed working here.
good,Lots of change over from snap-tite not a people friendly management team. Its a ok job for Erie not a lot of options that pay well in Erie. I would go back and work here if i had the chance.
good,"der Job als Finanzanalytiker war einkommensträchtig, entsprach aber auf Dauer nicht meiner Berufung"
good,"Typical work day is busy, steady and consistent pace.  Hardest part of the job is the demand to deliver parts in the a timely manner to meet TAT.  Most enjoyable part of the job is team work and the people I with."
good,Just get your stuff done and you will be fine. I would keep working there but my career choice for the future requires me to relocate to a different town.
good,"I was hired as a controls engineer to help design equipment to be either semi-auto, or become from semi-auto to full auto. This push was led by management of Parker Hannifin to try and limit the amount of people it was required to work in a certain area. On this note they were looking at trying to terminate so many people per year by fully automate in the plant."
good,"Parker has been and is still going through a lot of transitions while merging different  divisions. The benefits are excellent- health, dental, vision prescription as well as Parker funded Health Care Reimbursement accounts available."
good,I had opportunities to learn different skills due to the training I was shown. Safety is first in all training. I enjoyed working with the other coworkers.
good,"my position was kind of dangerous and wasn't compensated for the danger or type of production thats ask of employees."
good,Parker is a leader in its field and seems to treat employees fairly.  The benefits are very good and the overall work environment is non-threatening and promotes team work.
good,place is fun to work  at but many people get hired and leave right away not right for everyone especially thin skin people management is very hard on the wear
good,this was a great job. i learned a lot about electrical components and how to solder small parts. The work was not difficult at all. Very clean working environment.
good,"A typical day at work is twelve hours but they have been working"
good,"It wasnt a bad job just standing on feet for 8/10/12 hrs a day was stressful plus had to get so many pieces of the assembly line done each hr... decent pay, one thing hated was goin threw a temp service."
good,"Ótima empresa , bons benefícios , aprendi muita coisa lá , meu início profissional foi lá"
good,not a bad place to work if you're in the right spot.  some people are treated poorly if you did not work with them at a different job.  this plant is closing
good,"It was alright job. they are not very tolerant when you dont understand something and need help. They always said they will train and help everyone with whatever questions but thats not true,"
good,"good place to work friendly coworker also, benefits are okay. lot of hours you can make per week, we can work overtime if you want to. but where I work at need extra hand"
good,"An typical day, check parts, measure parts, final inspection and I had good communication with the managers,supervisors and machine operators, the same with others departments, shipping,inspection."
good,"Stressful and poor management. Low pay."
good,Very cutthroat.... nobody there gets along with one another.  The managers talk bad about the technicians behind their backs.  Just a total bankrupt ethical situation
good,A good place to work with opportunity for internal advancements or relocation options within Parker Hannifin Corporation. Salaries and benefits are middle of the road.There are long term employees here but the corporation can relocate the work should they desire to do so. there are stock options and 401k options which are nice.
good,the one thing i liked about working at parker hannifin was we got to deal with small car parts. it was easy to drill small wholes in parts then ship them out the door.
good,You will learn a lot working for this company and will multitask all the time (answering the phone while inputting orders and dealing with queries from customers and colleagues alike). The hardest part is you will have to be mostly self-reliant. The most enjoyable part is how much you will learn yourself.
good,Good place to work if you are used to factory environment. Very loud and busy like most factories. conditions can be rough from time to time but pay is decent.
good,Company offers challenging and rewarding work in the aerospace industry.
good,learned a lot about o rings working for parker and molding different types of machinery all need o rings parker has a very diverse work force makes it a pleasure to go to work every day
good,Traditional Asian company with lot of space to develop skill set and experience. Employees are easy going with lot of potential to grow for either the company and employee.
good,Worked for over 10 years.  Seem understand a work life balance is needed.  Management still trying to evolve out of top-down management style. Culture is laid back.
good,Parker is a MNC company. Manufacturing engineering good. Cmpany growth is good. calture also good. I am working there from july 15 to till date as a senior accounts officer.
good,"This was a coop position while I was earning my bachelor's degree. Learned a tremendous amount regarding information technology, manufacturing and fluid motion valves."
good,"En 2011, l'antenne belge de Parker Hannifin subissait encore les effets de la crise. L'ambiance y était morose et les opportunités de développement trop faibles."
good,There is plenty of work to keep you busy.  The culture is too driven towards metrics.  There are good people to work with.  No opportunities for advancement.
good,"Work was ok, group was ok, management was ok, contracted to customer was great for the most part and nice enough people, training was ok. I wouldn't work here again."
good,"Meetings in the morning, issues in past 24 hours to sort with production & customer services either in the UK or International. Review new orders for acceptance. Order RAW material for processing."
good,"Great company to work for, I learned a lot while working there. management was laid back and gave entry level personnel tremendous amounts of independence and freedom"
good,"I enjoyed working closely with Sales, Manufacturing, Quality, Engineering, Vendors to ensure we met our production goals and meet or exceed our customer's expectations."
good,"Started on as a temp through man power, quickly learned all my coworkers have been with this company for over 20 years so even though it is a bit harder to get hired on than most places the stability of the work life is obvious."
good,"Everything is awesome, really it is truly awesome, in fact its so awesome I can't quite capture the awesomeness in only one hundred and fifty characters."
good,the people are nice and the work is interesting.  It was a nice place to begin my career and I was happy to work their.  I learned a lot about the practical aspects of engineering from this company.
good,Good job for a mechanically inclined individual to get some experience. Pay rate isn't high enough to support a family though. Over all the people and the atmosphere is great.
good,management was not the best and your chance for advancing depended on who you knew and who did or did not like you. hard work was often over looked and friendship was often over valued.
good,"I enjoyed working with the customer base that Parker has and the great employees you do come across. However Parker as a whole, needs better management in order to really succeed as a company."
good,"Going through a lot of change, corporate strategy and direction is very good, local division management style and effectiveness varies and could be very good or very poor."
good,Room for career development.  Lots of responsibility.  Not a lot of oversight from management.  Poor annual review system.
good,"Hard work and long hours, but in those times the team pulls through, and lifelong bonds are formed.  Each division has a different culture, so my experience may be different than others."
good,"Great company if you fit in. Contractors are treated like second class citizens. You must get along with the old school style management or you will get let go. They have to change there ways or it will catch up to them eventually,"
good,"Commercial truck driver, looking for an opportunity to success in the trucking business. Love working with people, independent person."
good,Parker is a good company. But they have eliminated a great deal of employee benefits. They have a poor training system and advancement within process. They do not prepare for knowledge transfer when employees retire.
good,"consistantly busy from day to day learned to process labels , pick pack , use oldest cure date first , bagging machine , mould gas and oil seals , realy from engineering drawings ... help new starts"
good,"Parker had just bought  P. G. I., 3 years ago. I like to think they had good plans and promised a lot. They are a world wide organisation that believes in Lean production. Parker brings lots of sales and productivity charts. I believe they have a good bonus plan, but since the oil crises every thing went south and they laid off lots of people. (I really do not have a good idea how Parker really is). Once, we had a two hour lunch"
good,This job has some advancements if you are willing to take the time and learn the details of the jobs around as well as apply for them.
good,"Enjoyed working with my co -workers,worked here for 19 years,learned many jobs- copper machines,helium testing machines,trained multiple people over the years ,sad to see it close."
good,"Parker was a good place to work for benefits and pay. Expectations were high and mostly attainable, however some were beyond reach."
good,constant work environment with good co workers learned about factory work management was unfriendly/mandatory55hourwok weeks/friends I made
good,Very lean company.  They have recently laid off 40+ employees at their world headquarters.  The staff level is prior to the 2009 recession.
good,Never a dull day with different repairs on machines and different projects. Good employees and some supervisors. Pay is good and some benefits.
good,just do what your told and you'll be fine like most jobs in this world the rules and easy to follow and the breaks are generous they have a discount plan that is good for teenagers I would recommend this job for high school and college students looking for an easy job that isn't to stressful
good,Good company. Not much scope for entry-level engineers. However very encouraging work culture and positive coworkers. Management is also very proactive and employee considerate
good,"Travail très interressant si l'on s'y interresse un minimum"
good,"Excellent, great people like ""family"" bosses, engineers were excellent in listening to my suggestions in the workplace"
good,"ok."
good,"There are wonderful people in my division that work really hard everyday to exceed expectations.  When they are given a task they get the job done, regardless of the barriers in their path."
good,"Aprendi a lidar melhor com pessoas mais resilientes, sendo esta a parte mais difícil do meu trabalho."
good,"its a good place to work, their pay is competitive, they have a high retention of employees. the team i work with on my shift are very supportive of each other. i like it because my immediate supervisor is easy to get along with. i learn how to work in a team. the hardest part of the job is you are given a lot of responsibilities within a limited time."
good,"The company was enjoyable for the most part due to the friendly environment within my work station. Only downside to this company as far as I can see is the layoff rate and its increasing healthcare coverage prices, but other than that the company was a fun place to work."
good,"Like any other factory/plant job, Parker Hannifin has its pros and cons. The steady paycheck is nice and the jobs are not that difficult, but like most place, some of the managers and shift supervisors micro-manage too much for my taste. Too often there were supervisors who thought they knew more than employees who had been doing the same job for 15+ years."
good,"The company is massive, so there should be plenty of opportunity for advancement, but there isn't. For the last few years the company has been in a serious growing phase. The raises and bonuses have been minimal and there have been regular layoffs. They main issue with the company seems to be that they fail to recognize an excellent employee when they have one. Everyone is just a number to them. Nothing will ever happen to the bottom of the barrel employees. In fact, they will probably be able to retire from there unless they get bored with doing nothing. HR handcuffs Managers so much that they are hardly able to persuade employees to work at least the minimum. Everyone is seen as the same, so there really isn't much incentive to excel. The better ones will also have to cover for the underachievers in order to meet goals."
good,"Working as a CNC machinist is much more rewarding than testing parts. still have management down your back, but way more fun"
good,"I manage 2 warehouses that service a large Parker OEM customer. We deliver 2xs a day to the point of use in their kanban containers. We take the place of material handlers and material planners for the customer, absorb the inventory carrying costs, absorb freight costs."
good,"sentry is a part time seasonal job. it does not offer benefits, bonuses, or medical. you get paid for what you work. not recommended to those that can not handle working outside."
good,"It was fun. The people were pleasant and told you good morning. I was responsible for filing, data entry, shipping and receiving."
good,"working hard by testing the parts for leaks to make sure there wasn't any holes in them, my co-workers was always there by my side if I needed help"
good,it was an okay place to work if you didn't mind getting very dirty...  It sucked being the only female in the department...
good,Typical day includes meeting with assembly line operators and working to close out actions.
good,Door crisis werden de contracten van de uitzendkrachten gestopt
good,I worked with Parker Hannfin for 4 months and the culture of the company did not align with my values at all so I found myself struggling. While the work is challenging and there is much to learn if you end up at one of the divisions you do not know what to expect when you are there since there is no set culture within the company.
good,A typical day at Parker includes recieving the assignment in the work area you are assigned that day and to assemble all parts in a timely manner while assuring quality at all times because quality is the main goal when building for customers all while trying to reach the goal for the month. My managers and coworkers were good people who assisted when necessary. the hardest part of the job was trying to stay on top of building to reach the goal for that night and the month while making sure you build accurately so that each part could be tested and packaged to be sent to the customer.
good,"In a typical day I could be a line lead, a supervisor, and an assembler all in one. We work hard to make the company productive and profitable. My co-worker would call me hard working. The hardest part about me job would have to be dealing with down time."
good,I worked for parker which was a small distribution center that had a total of 4 people in the warehouse one boss and 3 sales agents.  Working at parker had it's days of being busy or very slow.  But having co-worker that I worked with still made time go by fast.  Management wasn't very helpful when it came to issues that we ran into.
good,Learned a great deal about over sea parts and customer service
good,"Het dagelijks leiding geven aan een team produktie-medewerkers en het zorg dragen voor het behalen van de geplande produktie output."
good,"empresa procura sempre lançar projetos para atender melhor seus clientes"
good,the problem  is salary is not in proper basis everymonth it is dragging to after 10th of every month
good,things of that sort it was great I did one of these things already a minute a go.
good,This company is also a great place to work at. Couldnt ask for anything better.
good,Originally owned by a Canadian company. Parker had just recently bought out this company before I left. While I was there management seemed to be in disarray. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.
good,Aan de hand van een lijst  bekijken waar je staat en aan de hand daarvan je werkzaamheden verrichten.. Heb in de jaren bij het bedrijf Interne opleidingen gehad FMEAs bijgewoond en een BBL opleiding niveau 1 afgerond voor verder info zie cv. Met de directie verder geen problemen in de jaren gehad dat ik er gewerkt heb.Met mijn collegas verder geen problemen gehad niet meer als ergens anders.(discussies etc). Het leukste van de baan  is dat je op verschillende plekken kan komen te staan .Zodat je weer op de hoogte blijft van de problemen  en veranderingen  op die afdeling.
good,This is a government contracting and accounting firm.  This company is motivated predominately by business needs.
good,"sit at work station, put parts together that have been thru the machines, make sure they pass and pack them"
good,It was really fun working with this company.Could learn many new things working with my co-workers.
good,We leren van elkaar op de werkvloer in een prettige werkomgeving.
good,"Contato com diversas áreas do conhecimento, aprendi que o importante e ter parceiros de trabalho, ótima direção e colegas de trabalho, o mais difícil era depender de outras unidades, e o mais agradável era ver o produto pronto."
good,"Parker Hannifin Corporation manufactures fluid power systems, electromechanical controls, and related components worldwide.  The company’s Aerospace segment provides flight control systems and components, including hydraulic, electrohydraulic, electric backup hydraulic, electrohydrostatic, and electro-mechanical components for precise control of aircraft rudders, elevators, ailerons, and other aerodynamic control surfaces. It also provides electronics thermal management heat rejection systems, and single-phase and two-phase heat collection systems for radar, ISAR, and power electronics. This segment markets its products primarily to OEMs in the commercial, military, and general aviation markets, as well as to end users."
good,"Look at the schedule to find out where your assigned for the day.Check the computer for orders and assemble, test and/or repair or package for customer. If assigned to another department you follow the lead person's orders. There was a lot of mismanagement thru the years, that lead to several manager dismissal's. I made several friend's thru the year's. People"" that go an extra mile"" to help you. The hardest part of the job was when I had to say ""Good-Bye"". The most enjoyable part of my job was learning new jobs, and skills and meeting new people."
good,"Advertises a work to hire recruitment, but it seems to be pretty rare that this happens.  This may be for you if you like variety to see what you may like to do in the future, but they cut me from my job a few weeks before I was eligible for insurance."
good,"Na Parker, tive que reaprender algumas coisas, a primeira dela a adaptação do sistema usado pela empresa, onde é um sistema muito antigo, e acredito que esta etapa foi muito difícil."
good,Ive worked on all different shifts as needed by other supervisors cause they said Im a good worker so they would always have me to work over on there shifts... The hardest part about my job was learn all the different rubbers and knowing witch ones swells up the most when its bein milled but I managed to learned all the rubbers and my job became a bit easy. I would say the most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that once I preform the parts and they all was inspected and came out grea t its a good feeling knowing that I could do a good job and satisfy the customer.
good,"There was always work to be done at Parker Hannifin. I learned many electrical circuit applications which included: modification of electrical design, troubleshooting, and reading electrical schematics. The supervisors working there were great and helpful to my education and experience with the work field. They tried to give me different variety of work so I can expand my knowledge. However, the work were fairly simple and not too complicated. I was hoping for more challenging work. The most enjoyable part of the job is working jointly with engineers on design and testing. I got to briefly learn about the regulations that are required before a project can be completed."
good,I like working with the people that I work with but the management is not good and the communication sucks. the most enjoyable part of the job is working 3rd no ones there and we get a lot done on 3rd then any other shifts. I am a first responder at parker.
good,"A job if there has ever been one. Not hyper challenging or especially inspiring but good work and plenty of it. Very stable company slightly top heavy at this point. Not many opportunities for advancement as growth is not a concern. Great people, some rather unrealistic managers, otherwise wonderful place."
good,My typical work day was routine but some days something new for learning myself.
good,It was a huge learning experience working for the Parker. Extremely fast paced and juggling required
good,"This was a fast paced, repetitive production work with exact specifications. Work was performed by teams. Each individual had assigned work and responsibility but was supported by both other team members and supervision. It was straight forward and direct work with congenial people all of which I liked."
good,"A typical day at work was getting my machine set up and running, making quality product. Also tear down of the machine once the product was completed. Helping co-workers with their machines as well, as in set up etc. Enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job would've been the extreme heat conditions in the summertime, as indoor temperatures could reach over 100 degrees at times. The most enjoyable part of the job would've been interacting with my co-workers and getting along as a team."
good,servied vehicles which included detailing and cleaning to archive excellent customer satisfaction by providing high quality service.
good,"Good company but no progresstion over the past two years. Management isn't the best, there are good people in the company which is why I have been there for 5 1/2 years but the hardest thing to do in this company is grow, once they think you are good at something they will try and hold you there for as long as they can."
good,"Parker's is a place to earn money and make it as your career. I learned more about team work and helping others with meeting their production goals. The only thing i did not like about the job is that the building didnt have air units; however, i did enjoy the bonus during Christmas. Over all i enjoyed working there."
good,Was a long time ago. IT was a good professional working environment.
good,The people are easy to get along with the machines are easy to work
good,good place to work for. would work there again. pay was good. benefits were good. worked there for 13 years in various positions. Worked my way from plant floor to the office
good,Fast pace work environment. great benefits and good pay.  they offer work out equipment and other great benefits.  Management is new and needs experience.
good,Good place to work. They have vacation and paid holidays. They offer 401k and insurance. Safe place to work. They have 3 shifts you can choose from...
good,"The job itself wasn't hard, it was the management that I had problems with. That and the amount of hours you have to work in the summer got to a pretty dumb amount."
good,Petty and selfish management no loyalty to career employees with many years of service. And somewhat bullies when they feel fit ....i have witnessed and been a victim to these actions.
good,The communication is not up to par a lot of missing dialog not enough English speaking individuals in the work place a lot of translators needed to communicate certain job requests
good,"Was able to learn and advance with some corporate constraints but overall good. People were always helpful. If you do get identified as a high potential employee, company offers many training's/opportunities and invests in employee."
good,"Even if you bust your a__ they still will believe the ""lead"" over you  Not all management is not like this only certain ones.  Other than that I really enjoyed working here."
good,"Good work environment, good management, but low salary and willing to change anything. It is not easy to entry as Parker employee. There is some opportunity entire company"
good,"An average workplace environment. Local management talks about the corporate mission, but doesn't always abide by it. They tend to oversale and then apply undo pressure oin the workforce to deliver."
good,Good place to work.  The people I work with make the time much more enjoyable.  Lots of work that never ends.  Repairing parts is a never ending job.  4-10 work schedule was very nice but the starting time (4:00) is a bit rough.
good,Fun place to work just didn't get enough hours to make ends meet. Nothing hard about the job you will be well trained. Have its ups and downs like any other factory.
good,"- The culture is one of total collaboration & teamwork"
good,"I worked in a small division. We were fortunate that our product had high margins because that is what our bonuses were based on. I felt sorry for people who worked in divisions like cylinders who worked a lot of extra time, but got almost no bonuses because of their commodity type product."
good,"Enjoyed my time at Parker, it is a good place to work and has good benefits. Work schedule/hours are long and unpredictable. There is a good working amongst the hourly associates, but some disconnectt with management"
good,Wish they didn't have to leave. The people that worked there were great. Almost like your second family. Would have definitely retired from Parker Haniffin.
good,It's hot and dirty and very competitive. Fast paced and stressful. Breaks are almost nonexistent at 1 10 minute and 1 15 minute break in an 8 hour shift. Standing on concrete all day. Lots of 10 or 12 hours shifts and lots of Saturdays. Good pay and good benefits though
good,"Not enough room to grow.  Management for the most part is fair. Although the pace is fast the help at times is minimal.  Very worried about metrics over morale.  Overall, I like my job - love my co-workers otherwise I wouldn't have been here for almost nine years. I just need more..... need to grow"
good,"Large catalogues so can be working on the same job, for a few weeks solid. I learnt to use a catalogue management system. management are supportive and always available."
good,Parker has a good strategy and very good support on career advancement. The division has not had consistency in leadership which affects customer relationships.
good,Management at the Lithia Springs location have ran some great employees out of Parker by by showing favoritism an being unfair. Great place to work. Again management destroyed hard working dedicated people
good,"This was a wonderful company to work for, I wish I could've stayed. I would go back, and will try to get back with them. Overall a great experience. Management was great."
good,Parker is the good company with strong background and  a great product as customer needs. I will recommend friends and family to work there at any time.
good,No communication and a lot of delays on fixing any machines. A lot of micromanaging and are very strict with punching in at a specific clock. The raises are very unfair and even after years of working.
good,Falta de capacidad para tener horarios adaptables a sus trabajadores.
good,"I have learned to be dedicated and punctual on my duties, and learned that to be safe in job is very important for everybody."
good,"always moving from start to finish"
good,"Parker Hannifin is a great solid company. From my own personal experience, Parker is a very conservative company but they still welcome input and are very receptive to comments and suggestions."
good,"Parker is very profitable and customer centered. The employees do everything possible to please Parkers customers back as far as the very  beginning of their supply chain. The work schedule is flexible and whatever is promised to the customers everyone is expected to support. There is a great of mid and top management turnover but the lower levels remain relatively consistent. The hardest part of the job is making things happen as quickly as is needed while the most enjoyable part is the constant rapid, fast moving  environment and feeling of accomplishment."
good,El equipo de trabajo con el cual conviví durante muchos años fue muy estable y bueno por lo que podíamos desarrollar nuestras actividades con motivación.
good,"inizialmete bene negli ultimi anni molto meno."
good,A very good team to work with; exceptional engineering department. A company with strong values and focus on High Performance Teams made working together more effective.
good,"Great place of benefits, always busy so you don't get board. Multitasking and being crossed trained in several areas so you are always learning."
good,"Parker is in everything, and is a great company worldwide. For me there was always work to do so it kept me busy and fast paced. I learned to operate all equipment such as Forklift, Hoist, Crane, Mill, Presses, Sandblaster, and power tools. I learned to lead a team, inspect safety in area, and organize work flow through Five S. Co Workers got along alright and worked hard together but was also part of the hardest part of the job. Sometimes you didn't get a good team and they were lazy which meant I had to do more to get the job done which is frustrating to no end. I loved my finished product, seeing finished parts I made was very satisfying. Management was hard to deal with. Unprofessional at times and uncaring of you as a person. There were few in management I absolutely respected there but I made the best of it. It was a plant job, and was focused on the product more than the crew."
good,"bad management, all chiefs no indians. no accountability"
good,"* Involved with Daily Production"
good,"Empresa que cumpre com os seus deveres para com os seus funcionários e mantém uma posição ética com todos e com o mercado. O ambiente de trabalho é agradável, assim como o clima organizacional. "
good,"Parker offers a great chance to learn and grow as a manager and advance quickly in the operations field. But it comes with a price, long hours and little guidance makes for a stressful work environment."
good,Good management and co-workers. Not a lot of room for advancement if you don't make yourself available to transfer from division to division.
good,"Liberdade para efetuar o trabalho, com apoio da gerência. Profissionais qualificados nas áreas de suporte."
good,buen ambiente de trabajo con los compañeros de producción lo que aprendi es el trabajar con responsabilidades mis compañeros es buena influencia cuando les preguntaba
good,I've learned lots about a manufacturing company.  I have been on a few trips to visit customers to work on projects and build relationships.  Great boss.  We'll have department potluck and celebrations which is always fun.
good,"As in most aerospace companies, projects can fall behind very easily which tends to pile up work. It is more common to work a 10 hour day than an 8 hour day. Claims to embrace Lean concepts but there is tremendous room for improvement."
good,The day always started with communication with the other shift operator. Then all equipment was checked out to make sure everything was ready to go. Then I checked all machines to see what was needed to run their shift. After alll machines were supplied with material I started taking away scrap. While keeping inventory of all material. Communication was needed to do your job right so getting along with co-workers wasn't that hard. The hardest part of the job was working with large bundles of steel. The best thing about the job was the co-workers and job oppertunities (advancements) and training.
good,Had to kiss up tomake other people happy.
good,"Tasks for everyday productions needs. Forklift, Inspection, Light and Heavy press operator. Scheduling of material for the line, Line Supervisor, Supervisory and QS9000 classes."
good,A typical day at work for me would to be to get to work and keep my head down workin to the best of my ability. I believe we are always learning and picking up new skills in and out of the work enviroment. I really enjoyed my working years at Parker Hannifin and was very dissapointed when we were told it was due to close and move the work to the far east.
good,"With annual sales exceeding"
good,"was really excited when I first started, did not miss a day or use unpaid personal time first 2 years. A change in management and increased ot changed how I felt about my job along with other underlying factors."
good,"I love my job it is challenging and keeps me busy all day, Management is struggling to find their way under new guidance from the Division Level and it is impacting the overall moral of the facility."
good,"Have no understanding of your personal life. But overall not a bad place to work, money is good but the management sucks. Not really an opportunity to climb the ladder use you are going to kiss alot of butt"
good,Worked at Parker for a very long time and as with all large organisations there are massive contrasts.  I enjoyed my time there which gave me lots of experience and opportunities world wide.
good,In the time that I was there I think there were at least 6 different managers they all went by who kissed up the most not who worked the hardest since they did not take the time to get to know the employees since they were only the an average of 2 years each.
good,My years of experience in the industry has allowed to be come more of a problem solver than a Sourcing Specialist.  The culture is good and safety is most important along with sales.
good,"Overall it has great benefits and pay, they are willing to work with you on certain thing, but very drama filled environment where upper management preaches one thing then does something else, a lot of favoritism going around."
good,"falta modernizar e dar mais oportunidades para novos colaboradores, a equipe é feita por no minimo 50% de funcionários aposentados."
good,Depending on the plant you are hired at depends on the quality of the job. At the Goshen plant the culture is awful and the plant is ousted by other plants so no chance of advancing anywhere.
good,"It was a good first warehouse job for me. They’re always productive but they are behind from their goals, but they also work hard to reach them and never point fingers."
good,"You will need to have the skills and knowledge to perform your work and learn on the way you are completing your projects, some training is available for employees"
good,"At Parker there is only to avenues for growth, either technical or managerial, for me coming from an acquisition that was not very good, actually that is not the standard in the industry."
good,Good benefits at this company. Personal growth is limited. Where you start you stay there for years. Good source to develop your aerospace experience.
good,Buen ambiente laboral con buenas ideas para la mejora de sus instalaciones
good,"Slow at the beginning of the month, and busy at the end of the month, Overall good Corporation to work for but I was in a bad subsidiary with poor management."
good,Lots of quality employees but focus on doing more with less is taking its toll.  This will eventually catch up by reducing quality and missing OTD targets.
good,"Racor is a great place to work; however, corporate has purchased a major competitor and is consolidating sites and streamlining channels.  Most enjoyable part of this job was the people.  The most difficult part was the culture of resistance to necessary change."
good,A good place to work with very good benefits and pay. Needs to have more training for positions. The most enjoyable part of the job was when it was time to go home.
good,"Overall, I would say that Parker Hannifin is a great place to work.  The culture and people are all very nice and friendly.  Everyone is easy to get along with and they all have the best intentions in mind when it comes to work related issues and problem solving."
good,Laid back atmosphere.  Most employees have been there well over 20+ years.  Long stretches of 10 hour days and hald days on Saturday.
good,"Great job.  Project I was working on relocated to Cleveland, Ohio so I decided to pursue opportunities elsewhere."
good,It was a pretty good place to work. The work was easy and the people were great to work with. It wasn't such a fast pace work place.
good,"Etude des commandes tombées la veille et consultation des mails"
good,Good work place to learn new things in the field of shipping and receiving as well as packaging. Management needs improved as well as equipment.
good,Employer provided a strong job culture and good work life balance.
good,"only worked there a short time,seemed like a good place to work ,enjoyed my time their ."
good,"I loved the job I did and my peers. Most of the management staff were excellent but some of the supervisors need to be retired and fresh, communicating and open-minded replacements need to be installed."
good,"My role is dull and based on the Job title i do isnt anything like what i have been used to in a previous company with the same job title. "
good,"Leuke bedrijf om te werken, hands on mentaliteit. Ze staan open voor opleidingen en willen je daarin helpen."
good,"money is great"
good,"Parker is a wonderful company, but still very old fashioned in many ways in the way it operates. A lot of things about the company are cultural and the old way (an ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ mentality)."
good,"Typical day: generally busy, not boring. "
good,"The HR team is incredible, they do their best to fit individuals where their talents and skills match and they seek feedback for overall improvement and satisfaction."
good,"Parker is a nice place to work, but really do not understand workload and time. Very fast paced environment with a lot going on but with not enough people to do all the work."
good,"Really nice working environment, "
good,"a typical day at work would be super long, I really didn't learn too much from this place. the management was okay the co workers were lay back. stuff got done just at a slow rate"
good,Eu não fiz estágio direto na empresa. Meu estágio estava incluído no dia a dia do SENAI .
good,Very busy and productive office with main focus on professional  patient healthcare.
good,A typical day at work consists of evaluating the production lines to make sure they are flowing efficiently.  I also troubleshooted machinery.  Holly springs is not a great place to live.  The coworkers were pleasant to work with.
good,Assembling valves for jcb and catapiller. I learned how to read all the drawings correctly as it was important that you put all the right parts into the valve otherwise it would cause failures. We worked as a team so it was very important that we all worked well together as a team. There was 3 of us to the cell i was on. I did enjoy working there as you get used to the work daily so can pick up your speed easily.
good,"Hired at entry level and upon departure maintained level 5 secretary III position. Business requires more overt displays of employee accomplishment. Although you may go the extra mile and offer your assistance to many projects and associates throughout the day, your priority should be your immediate supervisor. I learned it amounts to very little if what you have accomplished in a typical day cannot be recognized, acknowledged, or measured by your immediate supervisor. I valued my role, co-workers, and my department managers. I believe many to be top notch, educated, capable professionals. I believe too that in a bad economy hasty decisions are made with little regard to the consequences. My supervisor was straightforward, and genuine. I found him to be honest, trustworthy, and sincere. I was offered many opportunities for growth. New challenges and greater responsibilities were introduced regularly, which helped to build confidence and self worth. The tools and resources necessary for success were readily available including online business courses for interested employees. The negative aspects of working for this company are relatively few. Perhaps one of the less positive aspects is in managements failure to identify those personal qualities and unique traits in individual employees which can become both an asset and enhancement to the business. Lack of self awareness and passion in management can deplete employee drive, confidence, and productivity. This destructive tunnel vision may cause management to jump to an early often incorrect assumption that an employee has been"
good,Nice place to work with good benefit and they celebrate team member input and co worker are nice too and you can work over time when orders are really busy
good,"Racor Parker was a good company to work for. We had medical, dental, vision, 401k. Wellness program benefits. I very much enjoyed working at Racor. HR team was very supportive and always willing to help."
good,i recommend this company for many people. they pay great and never top out. parker give safty day gifts for no loss time accidents and take care of their employees.
good,"Good, job. Just very monotonous. I do the same thing every night. It has taught me how to focus on a task for a long period of time."
good,"Being an internship, of course there weren't opportunities for advancement before graduation or much compensation. My internship was extended to 2 years from one until budget caused my layoff so they had some flexibility and appreciation of my efforts. "
good,"empresa ótima para se trabalhar, boa convivência, os departamentos se integram, oportunidade de crescimento e auto desenvolvimento"
good,"Parker Hannifin División Stratoflex es una empresa estable que tiene un excelente trato con las personas ya que la paga es buena, se tiene una cultura enfocada en Lean y seguridad. Es una planta muy limpia y con mucha capacidad de adaptarse a la demanda dinámica de los clientes."
good,The most important part of my job was being efficient and an effective work while still satisfying the customers needs.
good,"Work goes really fast if you stay focused. Its a great place to work if you want stability and benefits. "
good,"Third shift people are awesome, but the plan it self could be a a lot more organized. Good pay, challenging but good work, can be easily injured if you’re not careful."
good,Overall Company was great the individual factory I worked for had poor management. Management bent rules for some individuals they for many years weren't following laws involved in skilled labor and apprenticeship program that did not exist until 2018.
good,"The company wasn't perfect but its alright to work there, they do move you around to help others but isn't fair when you need help. We need each other"
good,I love my job it’s just management I think they just do what they want at this place I mean they make they own rules that’s not even stated in the handbook it’s lack of communication
good,I loved my job but it hurt my body. Extremely repetitive and not very ergonomic. Things have changed since I was there but I'm not sure I would want to go back because of repetitive motion injuries that I have not been able to have corrected surgically.
good,"Empresa onde tudo acontece em segredo, não passa confiança aos colaboradores"
good,"A typical day would include timecard approvals, daily meetings to cover the previous days performance and then communicating the goals for the current day. As the day progressed it would include removing road blocks for ensuring quality processes were adhered to and cross training internal departments on the importance of quality and any quality related findings. I made it a point to spend 10-15% of my time researching ways to improve quality processes and procedures and developing individual productivity plans to make sure associates understood their contribution to the overall success of the team. The hardest part of the job was motivating others through change initiatives considering the fact that I lead mostly tenured associates who had been with the company for an average of 15 years. However, I found success with implmenting change when I engaged the the team and implemented High Performance Team strategies. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving customer feedback that product was delivered on-time with excellent quality."
good,"Work life balance is non existant, and it's too micro managed. Great benefits and pay and nice new shop to work in. Colleagues are great, the job itself is very complex."
good,"Worked as a contract employee for a year.  It was supposed to be temp to perm after 3 months.  After 7 months they finally told me the steps/certifications to be hired, I completed all the requirements but they never offered my a permanent position with the company."
good,parker was the best company I ever worked for but I did not agree with management the company changed ceo too much so the employees always were confused by all the different ways of doing things
good,Consolidation of many locations and validation of products on 80/20 mix causing many changes in work place environment. Parker stock has done very well in the industrial sector.
good,Typical days consisted of an unreasonable amount of hourly work to be done with limited supplies or direction. Hourly employees would have to make critical decisions with no assistance form upper management.
good,"Set up and operate machines for air refueling parts."
good,"I was board a lot, but got thru it. I tried to move to another department but had a hard time doing that. The people were nice for the most part. They tried to make it a good working environment."
good,I feel like management don’t see or recognized the kind of employee you are no matter how or wat u do they never will give you the opportunity to grow up in the company if is not the plan or you are in the favorite team .
good,"Great place to work for, to Bad they decided to move to another state. Layoffs where terrible had to say goodbye to many coworkers. Corporate Greed!!!"
good,Work culture for the site could be challenging as it was a acquisition.  Great benefits and security under original CEO but changed significantly after a change in leadership.
good,"The place is very hot to work in, the workers think they run the place. The pay isnt good enough for how people are treated, not a good working enviroment"
good,"A fun, fast pace company, just don't promote within.  The staff are very knowledgeable with plenty of years of service.  With the availability of three shifts  available the most popular one would be the morning  shift, but takes several years of service to  get one."
good,I liked it a lot. It was a great place to work but I decided to head in a different direction. I still have contact with some people at Parker. I was glad to have worked there.
good,Had fun working there. The bad part was the upper management (ceo's) thought they knew what they were doing by closing the plant. And they didn't. Stuff was talking a lot longer and costing more than they wanted. They were more interested in money than the employees.
good,"Parker Hannifin RACOR Division in Holly Springs, MS is a manufacturing company producing air filters.  As an air filter company, no benchmarking of other companies has been made.  A few products in the lineup do reasonably well but many are old and nearly obsolete with no awareness by management of their dismal nature or a need to plan ahead for future product marketability.  Also missing is technical awareness of the inner workings of filtration and fluid dynamics.  New product development which has occurred has been extremely low volume with a very high degree of wasted resources with poor project management skills.  These very low volume, niche-market products tend to be developed more by appearance, rather than function.  In short, the highest volume products being manufactured today at this location are dying in the marketplace, having being used on older equipment which is being removed from service at an alarming rate."
good,"When there was work you are busy shipping was good. They had benefits to help the employee bonus, free message. When there isn't work to do you get laid off."
good,"Entrei na empresa para trabalhar na parte de furadeiras,voltei a fazer  mais um curso, o de  torneiro cnc,consegui uma vaga de operador de centro de usinagem,colaborei muito para me profissionalizar aprender tudo sobre minha função na empresa,evitando faltas no dia a dia para não prejudicar a produção,"
good,Co-workers and management worked well together.  Enjoyed working with others and troubleshooting problems. Would have liked better opportunities for advancement within company.
good,Parker Hannifin Corporation has a very conservative business structure and model that uses out dated computer system and is slow to change and meet market and customer demands/needs
good,The management team is too worried about their own careers and don't pay attention to many employees with lots of experience and knowledge in the aerospace industry.
good,"Good people"
good,"I really liked my job at Parker, the people were good to work with and made some good friends there. I was a brazier for a while but after my cancer treament I stepped down from that position do the the loss of feeling I suffered as a side effect of the chemotherpy. They worked with me alot on that. I think the management lied to us alot and now alot of people are out of work there because the moved the production to Mexico, a place that over 800 people once worked is now down to like 50 last I heard."
good,-Expected to work from 7am to 6pm most day.
good,Worked different cells everyday building parts for customers requests followed work instructions and blue print. Had daily safety meetings. Did 5'scharts daily in the cells.
good,"This is a large company with exceptional benefits. Affordable health insurance, profit sharing, 401k with company match. The rest was just another production job. I worked in electronic controls division."
good,Beware if You hire in as a temp you may or may not obtain a permanent job with them depending on the month they are having. It was a good place just alot of maybes just because it was a slow month
good,"Muitas alterações na gerência, difícil situação financeira que gera muita instabilidade e mudanças de rumo."
good,"Empresa boa para se trabalhar ótimo ambiente de trabalho , salário em dia"
good,"This is a good company to work for, however several departments are very understaffed, therefore it can be very stressful to work in this kind of environment. Also, the company's metrics are not achievable or realistic. There is also no job security if you are a new employee. Several departments continue to lay off employees rather than hire support staff for existing employees."
good,Really enjoyed my job as assembler!! day to day operations not allowing middle management do their jobs. Confidential does not mean confidential. Favoritism was over the top.
good,"if your work group had not expereiecned a recent layoff, you are due for one. PH believes in distributing the pain across organizations w/o reflection of the business itself."
good,"Great people to work with. Fast pace, good management. Lot of hours."
good,Paker Hannifin has a great culture who works well together and is continually improving processes which give Parker an advantage over competitors.  Excellent training opportunities as well as great hours.
good,"needed to prepare manufactured parts for next stage of operation. somewhat fast paced, learned how to work as part of a team concept. workplace culture was learning environment since most existing employees were long term, imbedded experienced types."
good,"Great place to work  but outsourced us and we lost our job."
good,"Good place to work. Friendly employees. Lower wage, but culture is a good balance. Managers are fairly attentive to employee needs.  Overall good experience."
good,"Ok, Not bad"
good,parker was a company that wanted quality then quantity. co workers were the best/ we truely felt like family. great pay but sometimes lots of mandator yovertime
good,"I've had multiple roles at Parker, and my experience greatly related to my supervisor.  When I had an engaged manager, I was able to achieve my goals, garner feedback, and influence the organization in a positive way.  The majority of my co-workers were competent, kind, and exhibited a positive attitude.  There were frustrations over several management decisions, the lack of visibility, and the speed at which change occurred."
good,"Parker has high expecations, which force individuals to contribute to the success of the corporation.  In the long run, this has a very positive influence on the corporate performance."
good,"Excelente experiencia en general, con mucho aprendizaje, conocimiento, viajes, crecimiento como profesional y como persona."
good,"Gestisco autonomemente il lavoro della giornata, in linea di massima liberamente, a parte delle richieste particolari del mio diretto responsabile, inoltre interagisco con le colleghe della sede legale per poter collaborare al meglio."
good,I enjoyed working at Parker. I learned a lot working on projects and interacting with very many smart and talented people.
good,A typical day would consist of getting a phone call on Sunday evening about one of our Hydraulic Hybrid Systems that failed in the field and I had to be there first thing in the morning (wherever in the U.S.) I would book my traveling arrangements and fly down Monday morning along with other Field Service Technicians. We would figure out what the issue was and have the unit back to the customer within 24 hours from break down. Another big part of my job was setting up the assembly process at one of our customers manufacturing facility. Implementing new quality control processes and counter measures to insure our product was assembled accurately.
good,Buena                                            .
good,Management isn’t the greatest but all the employees I work with make it hard to leave every body has great attitudes and are just all around good people just need more money and more hours
good,"problemas con la cultura laboral,  las actividades en piso de producción demasiado informales."
good,"-Facilidad de acceso a información para autoaprendizaje."
good,"Parker Hannifin was a wonderful place to work. I wish that I could be hired back with the company. I am a fast pace worker and doing pieces per hour was what I enjoyed. Always enjoyed learning new things. Building robotics regulator's lubricators filter kits for Wilkerson n Ingersole Rand. Also assemble combos for the regulator, lubricators, and filter. Work in the Dial Air station assembling test n repair the dials."
good,"People wouldn't train you, they seemed to focus on their own job and wouldn't show you other machines to use, very hard to get good at any of them when it was like this"
good,"Great Company to be a part of My EXP. was good, I was provided with all in the information needed to perform my job effectively. I was traveling between Houston tx and Shelby NC during my contracted position. I was provided an apartment in Houston."
good,Ok place to work. Good benefits and plenty of hours. Clean and warm place to work. Nice machinery and a good maintenance plan safety is of a very high importance witch is nice.
good,"Challenging work environment,  international business was challenging at time due to time change differences.  Very interesting job, great employees in manufacting"
good,"Productive and family feel workplace, growth, caring for people, training  for other jobs was a must, being a part of teams also a must, a lot of board meeting which I felt took up to much production time, there was a lot of company team building outside of company location which was good for team building, always good food from the ladies of the plant for lunchs and company brought meals also."
good,"Pros  "
good,"The workflow in this shop was periodically fast and slow and that resulted in a lot of conflict in the shop."
good,"Parker has good pay excellent benefits and profit-sharing Excellent paid vacation, Excellent holidays I believe it was 11 paid holidays per year, if you have to work in a factory I guess this is one of the better ones for work at !"
good,"I Like  working there and all the time I have no problem with the  place.Just didn't pay  enough and Express  stopped  going to  Parker Inc. I miss it there ,.     My typical day at work was  busy with work and then you want to make you're  quote  for the day. How to work with different people and I'm so happy that I got to work in a good inviting  place.Keeping up with everyone in my assembly line for the day.Is meeting a lot of fun and enjoying all my co. Workers?"
good,Was rolled into Parker through acquisition and was promoted to business team leader for the division after which I was promoted to group level to eventually being promoted to corporate level for business development for Oil and gas
good,Overall good place to work. Weird shift hrs and not very flexible on hrs. But good compensation for a michigan job. Very easy and laid back. Come in do your job go home atmosphere.
good,Great company to work for with an energetic team of people. I had a great deal of fun and learning experience with the rest of the team. It is also very organized.
good,They run a good operation at the Aerospace facility. Good policies and putting efforts in to upgrade their support! Very interesting and a large variety of processes. Many good people in production.
good,"All in all its a ""Ok"" company to work for.  You get payed decently however their seems to be a lot of favoritism for 1st shift compared to other shifts like people coming in late etc (management included)  Employees are great and great atmosphere just mind your own business and stay off the radar."
good,Great place to work for. Duties vary every day depending on the orders for that day. The hardest part of the job is when machinery is not working properly.
good,"My coworkers were fantastic. They made the job worth coming to, and I loved that my division had Casual Friday, which also included many of us either going out together for lunch, or ordering in food. That said, the job itself wasn't what I wanted, and I became bored with it quick. I reached my learning peak within a couple of weeks, until we got a new software program within the department that meant learning something new all over again. But, just because the job wasn't a good fit for me doesn't mean that it won't fit someone else perfectly."

Other than that, it's definitely a place that you can pay anything off in no time, if you're comfortable with just 40 hours, don't come here. If you're looking to make money and see some amazing things that we create, this is where you want to be."
good,"Could work 14 hours a day if wanted."

good,A good place to start.  Plenty of opportunity to move up.  Most people are friendly but lack some training and customer service skills.  3rd shift lacks direction and does not meet goals.
good,Work is per the schedule but little hectic. Team is very helpful and friendly but the priorities were keep changing due to the dynamic nature of the project.

However, many of the customers blamed Parker for quality and manufacturing issues that were known to be design issues and installation issues of the the product that we produced, of which, we had no responsibility.  We were not allowed to challenge them."
good,"Parker hannifin has a laid back work environment , friendly atmosphere, very enjoyable place to work, production but wasn't fast paced, the hardest part of the job was making sure you have all the correct parts some valves had several parts, most enjoyable was the friendly atmosphere ."
good,"I enjoyed working there. The plant was close to my home. Everyone was friendly, like a family. It was part of the community and everyone was sad to see it close. That has had a big impact on our community."
good,"Parker, was a great company to work for. They go out of their way to train their employees to ensure they are ready for the tasks at hand. The only reason for leaving the company was due to relocation."
good,It use to be a great place to work until the last year I was there When I started there at Parker I really felt secure with my job and future I really was looking forward in retiring from Parker but they changed the manag. the last two years of working there.

good,"Entreprise plutôt familiale , nombreuses opportunités de développement."
good,The corporate structure for this company is one of the best in a professional setting.  Multiple divisions to work within which offers multiple opportunities to be explored.

good,"A typical day at work consisted of a daily huddle and discussion about the days work.  It would then go to either a continuation of production for a job, or into a setup for a new job.  The experiences I received from there were how to run a large cnc lathe and an interesting, new form of tooling.  The management was helpful in solving/ resolving problems that come up in the workplace.  The co-workers were a very friendly bunch, very close-knit.  The hardest part of the job was getting over the stress of the cost of material which I worked on.  The enjoyable part of the day was when at the end I had produced some very expensive parts."
good,"If you work at Parker-Hannifin, expect to be treated like a second-class citizen for the first few months.  A lot of the old-timers are bitter and refuse to lift a finger to help you do your job if it's less than 2 minutes before break or lunch.  If you catch them during their work hours, they wont say ""you're welcome,"" or ""good morning.""  They are angry all the time.  "
good,Busy always busy which I enjoyed extreme high paced.  learned a great deal on many levels to much to explain in a written message.  my immediate manager was great for the most part.  upper management needed a little upgrade in etiquette and people skills.  my co-workers became my friends even now.  hardest part of the job was not enough time in the day to complete all you planned.  I enjoyed the high paced seemingly stressful job.  would love to work for them again despite the issues they may have...
good,ran assembly line with hydraulic machines in a very hot and fast moving environment.  started my day at 6am and ended at 2pm with a 20 minute paid lunch.
good,Jobs are simple pay is okay but could be better. Will make more doing the same job at other plants. Trainers will take the time but after a few days expect you to know it well.
good,"A Parker é uma das melhores empresas para se trabalhar, fui convidado a sair somente pro causa da situação econômica do Brasil, o que mostra que a empresa realmente se preocupou com o bem estar do funcionário."
good,This was a positive and educational experience.  Nothing but good things to day about the company and people at this location.

good,Great conglomerate. Very good support for Engineering. six Sigma programs. Industry leading technology. Professional leadership and Management.

good,Nice place to work. The workforce is friendly and talented and everyone gets along with each other. The pay and benefits are highly competitive.

good,"me gustaba que habia tiempo para tomarse un cafe ."
good,Specialized engineering based company focused on premium quality products.  They are integrated into many markets and serve a wide variety of products.
good,I processed the UPS and FED EX packages and worked with customer service to get hot shipments scheduled and delivered. My co-workers there were like family.I learned a lot about the shipping department and how things are processed.
good,"Joined the company’s European Trading Subsidiaries group and was responsible for the design, development and implementation of supply chain enhancements to the company’s JDE systems."
good,"i would turn on my test stand. then make sure i had parts to use. then check test stand to make sure there were no promblems with it, then start working on produceing vales for my part. then check vales on test stand. i would do this all day 8 to 12 hours a day."
good,"Nothing personal this is a great company to work for, just be cautious of the circle of friends that you will notice after being there 2 to 3 days or so."
good,"This company was inviting of employees, and had a creative way of producing an environment of productivity. Due to the company being placed in a small town, and me having been 18, and 19 during the experience, I at times felt a little out of place. Overall, however, it was a very great place to work."
good,"Good work environment. With change in leadership recently, there are a lot of changes - some of these are not very well thought off"

good,"un dia tipico en parker era entrar y checar pendientes para darles prioridad no sin antes haber checado que las lineas estubieran en perfecto estado y orden, la direccion y la gerencia eran de lo mejor mucha confianza y con mis colegas igual, la parte mas dificil era que no podia haber algun error y eso me gustaba por que representa siempre retos, y lo que mas me gusto del trabajo es que era muy interesante el trabajo."
good,"Over all good place to work but pay is to the low side for many positions."
good,Smaller division with lots of potential upside. Room for personal growth.
good,Empresa oferece um bom ambiente para se trabalhar e apoio para os funcionários.

good,There is a lot of hands on training at Parker in order to enhance the learning process
good,Learned a lot about supply chain management there.  Great atmosphere to work in.  Some management was difficult to work with.
good,A lot of the job was transactional at times.  I was making a lot of strides to be more strategic and have better systems in place for handling the everyday tasks.  There are always continuous improvement projects going on.  Most of the management team was good.
good,Fast paced environment.  They get the job done.  Most of the people are great to work with but there are always the few that no one really wants to be around.
good,"A typical day at this work place was working with the Suppliers to ensure that the prevention efforts would in fact prevent further issues and teaching several Suppliers on how to complete an accurate PPAP.  I have learned throughout this job how to accurately work with the Suppliers.  The co-workers were a joy to work with, as with any job there were good co-workers and co-workers hard to deal with.  The hardest part of this job was trying to satisfy management at unrealistic goals.  The most enjoyable part of this job was working with the Suppliers."
good,"Toffe, behulpzame collega's. Je wordt goed opgeleid en je leert veel op korte tijd. Voor mij is de afstand (40km) een minpunt."
good,No balance of life at Parker.  Nothing but work.  I found the management style to be indifferent to the employee's welfare.  There didn't seem to be much appreciation for what I'd contributed but more for what I apparently didn't do.
good,"High stress work environment"
good,Fantastic Supervisor/Mentor. Taught me more than I would have ever expected in 1.5 years.
good,I enjoyed my job at Parker. I love a challenge. lost my job due to lack of work
good,everyone was very helpful and mentoring. good opportunity for challenging work every now and then.
good,At Parker managemant was the hardest part of the company to get along with. seems like they could never make up there mind on how they wanted things done.
good,"I enjoy the people I work with on a daily basis."
good,es un trabajo de presion constante y demandante requiere de mucho esfuezo fisico todo el turno el trabajo se hace manual el surtido de produccion
good,Overall this company is a great fun place to be at. The employees there are nice and helpful once you settle in. This company offered great benefits. I actually loved my job there. I just wish management was more respectful towards their employees and recognized hard working employees.
good,Parker is an easy going place. There is a lot of politics. over all it is a good place to work at. It can be annoying trying to get a full time position there if you are a temp.
good,A lot of good people to work with. Can learn many management program. The company is growing globally especially in Aisa-Pacific ream. You can have a chance to work there if you want.
good,Typical day started with getting blue prints for fabrication.
good,Fast-paced work environment. Very good experience. Everyone is a team-player and you all work together to accomplish what is needed.
good,reading blue prints and going through the processes to insure products are to customer specs.
good,"Parker is a company that feeds off the BOTTOM LINE (profit). In certain divisions the management team is a NETWORK of FRIENDS opposed to the Best Interest for financial Success. The Standard Health Care Coverage is very competitive for hourly employees and more costly for salary. Parker offers a college reimbursement program up to 10,000 per academic school year( Which I personally took advantage of). Pay scale is very unorganized based on past practice from prior political propaganda(applies to hourly employees only), however hourly rates are competitive for the geographical location. Also Parker offers a 401k with a company match up to 6 percent which I recommend to participate in. Work environment is very clean and the Youngstown Division is proud to keep safety atop of business agendas and strive to make it the safe work place in which it is. Overall this is a great place work. I recommend this company as a great opportunity for employment. 5 stars !!"
good,- I worked as a contractor twice at Parker Hannifin (Agency: Aerotek)
good,Had varied business / project opportunities.  Innovative and leading edge industrial company.  Strong engineering basis.  Global opportunities available.
good,"good company to work for, as long as you don't like taking time off almost ever. depending on demand of parts, they will give you mandatory overtime to work every weekend if needed."
good,Parker is a good company to work for. It  offers great benefits. It also has a lot of room to grow with in the company. Team leaders and group leaders help their team members advance.
good,Not that bad good environment good energy not bad all around place to be able to work for not bad hours always interesting place to be for sure that is all I can say
good,"Turn over Is high mainly because of management and opportunity for advancement. Benefit are great and ppl are somewhat good , management is some what ify."
good,"Nice place to work. People are friendly and open. ready to help if you needed."
good,"ottimo ambiente lavorativo, buono lo stipendio, troppo breve il contratto di lavoro"
good,"I enjoyed the work that I did and it was never hard. I did not enjoy the culture and how some are allowed to get away with things that others are not. Being a union shop means absolutely nothing because they don't look out for everyone and really don't care. Other than that, the work is cool, the things that you can get involved in is cool. If you don't mind a 25 minute lunch so you can get off sooner, that's cool too. Overtime is limitless. They offer you OT during holidays a lot. SO, hey if that's what you're looking for...do your thing."
good,"Good company to work for, unexpectedly was laid off after 23 years. Returned as a temporary employee multiple times. Cross training in various departments in a busy work environment is plus."
good,"Good place to work except that the management is not good because superior are promoted on whom you know and not what you know, So supervisor are like chickens with out heads running around the plants."
good,"This was a good place to work, Good pay, good benefits, and a great benefit package. They were however moving a lot of their business to Mexico around the time I left the company."
good,Management training needs improvement. Management needs to work on people skills and the way they treat and how they speak to their employees in some areas.
good,"learned how to pot filters, use machines for filters, meet other people from different country's, pleat a filter, welding, forklift driving, worked overnight"
good,Existe buen ambiente de trabajo los compañeros son serviciales.
good,Most people working there have been there a long time. Unless you are friends with the upper management you might have a hard time and find yourself stressed.
good,"Overall good place to work, great co-workers. Decent health benefits. Business casual atmosphere. They paid for school and training courses as needed. The hardest part of the job was advancement, promotions."
good,Parker requires a lot from their employees without providing the proper training to complete the job. It’s a sink or swim environment where they try to figure out the week and give opportunities to only certain individuals.
good,"good company to work for  got to operate machines "
good,"the job and the people are great, but the management likes to micromanage, and if you go along, you don't get along. the benefits are great, but not worth the headache"
good,"If you are a factory person, this is the place for you. Great incentives, competitive pay & benefits. Easy to follow standardized work practices. High performance work teams allow you to feel involved."
good,"Nice team and company but the salary is low for the tasks given, but it gives a good reference to work in this company for your career, and follow a corporate path."
good,"Currently going through downsizing and letting go of multiple departments. Majority of production is being outsourced. Management within the past 5 years had significantly changed,"
good,"Great group of people to work with.  High variety of tasks in a fast paced environment, particularly for the aftermarket side of  the business.  Above average tenure and great benefits.  I was proud to work for Parker and enjoyed supporting the military and commercial Aerospace market for a number of years."
good,Empresa boa de trabalhar e pessoal engajado no desenvolvimento da empresa.
good,Worked well as a team member and independently. I was promoted from a planner / scheduler to engineering data administrator. I learned how to schedule around vendor delivery times.
good,"I had a long career with Parker and enjoyed most of it. Lately, they are trying to accomplish too much with too small a work force putting extreme pressure on all employees who care about the company (which most do)."
good,"The culture can be good as long as you get a long with your team members and work as a team. If management does not participate in making job environment better. Things can fall apart. I love helping user with all kinds of issues. I always had a solution for the issue. The hardest part working for parker. Was lack of team effort and management help. I learned a lot from this company, such as  IBM notes, Engineering softwart and network infrastructure. They really did not had a culture. Each department did their own thing. I work with a wonderful team, but we were not always on same page."
good,i rilly enjoyed my job there very much up till the last 6 or 7 mounths management changed up alot and meral went down fast and the employees started quiting and takin retirement and some took early retierment
good,"The working with my various teams, over the years was very much an enjoyable positive experience. I learned much from my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job, was to solve problems when they arose. I learned employee interaction and all of my technical knowledge from my most recent employer."
good,"Pas d'avis spécifique."
good,"A pressão de trabalho é moderada no dia a dia."
good,"Parker promotes empowered employees and excellent customer services as core parts of their culture. Interactions with co-workers has always been easy as everyone understands we are part of a team, even in different departments."
good,Gained knowledge of Pricing and interacted with top & corporate management team. Overall good learning experiences for last 5.5 years.
good,A decent work place with great management. My co-workers there were tolerable as with any workplace there are those that you get along with and those that you don't. The most enjoyable part of the job were the morning exercises.
good,My typical day was Monday through Friday 8-5.  I had the opportunity to learn the value of Lean and how it benefits the shop floor as well as the office.  Management was an issue do to the fact that the turnover was really high.  Up and comers would usually only stay about three year before they relocated to a bigger Parker facility.  This caused some stability issues for the Team Members in their daily tasks which would ultimately led to their frustration.
good,"Fun place work, good benefits. I learned a lot ,about rubber seals. Good management and good co-workers. The hardest part of job was set-up."
good,"Overall good company to work for"
good,"PH is a great company overall.  Some of their practices, and I.S. systems, are considerably behind current standards.  "
good,"The company took time to teach the CNC machines to the employee.  There were opportunities to advance through an apprenticeship program. Management was easy to work with, and co-workers worked together."
good,"Well known / leader in the industry. High end products and people."
good,São empresas boas para se trabalhar mas sugão demais os funcionarios
good,"Co-workers very friendly and outgoing"
good,Limited capabilities and opportunities for growth key in manageing distribution for the region and meet and exceed growth goals
good,"Parker Hannifin Stratoflex is a great company with a nice niche of product line, servicing industrial, aerospace/defense, etc.  The difficulty here is having such great product and quality but taking to long to get it out the door.  Must take care of the customer!"
good,"1.not as much"
good,Atypical day could change within hours of getting there. Learned how to test the pumps and set them up for customers
good,"=> Um dia típico - trabalho padrão para desenvolver atividades o que facilita e faz com que seja aproveitado o máximo do tempo dedicado para desenvolver trabalho;"
good,société américaine avec beaucoup de contrainte mais très agréable au niveau travail très varié
good,I have learned alot working at this company and feel I have matured a lot since I first started working here. The Supervisors are great! The hardest part of the job is the obtaining goal every day when your relying on machines that do not always work the same everyday. The enjoyable part of work is the co-workers we are like a little family especially in my department. There is a lot of changes going on currently and a lot of cutbacks placing a hold on moving up.
good,Parker Hannifin is a well rounded company. They have the chance of advancing to different departments throughout the building. Daily work is nice because it is a clean environment.
good,Stable company
good,Talked with many different people throughout the US and learned a lot about them and the business they worked for.
good,not a liberty to share per current Governmental Practice Requirements
good,"Nice place to work co-worker are good, work is not hard. Management could be better in communicating with the employyes."
good,i have been sent for training on some beneficial courses. Worst thing about the job would be the pay or raises were not based on job performance.
good,Good oppurtunity to support family with plenty of hours to work and learn all aspects of a production job
good,"Great compensation, and benefits. Not many growth opportunities once you advance to the top grade pay. Company has good job security. They have been in business for over one hundred years."
good,"A typical day at Work is having our safety meeting in the morning before we start work to catch up on everyone’s day before, if there were any safety concerns or updates on cells. Then we would get to work, my day is full of work to keep me busy. If I don’t have much work to do, I’d find something to do to stay busy like doing 5s or audits in other cells."
good,Nice place to work. Safety first in company.Nice environment in company.overall good experience.management is ok.learned to operating mazak machine .and cmm job cheking
good,Human resources and managment always chanching so you will star all over again no good management but over all it pays good just be ready to not be at home with your familiy always working monday tru sunday you have to fight for days off and that makes employees to say you don't corporate with them they make you look bad
good,"The company is making strides toward employee engagement which I believe will make it a better place in the future."
good,"While the work environment could have been better managed, the co-workers were a delight and very helpful if any questions needed to be answer in the middle of a shift. I never felt like I was not properly trained, and the work came at a steady but quick pace so I always felt productive. The only issue I had came with scheduling, and eventually most shifts were flexed out as business slowed. Lay-offs are frequent at that specific worksite, and unfortunately that led to my exit from the company in search of more stable income."
good,"Overall, a good company to work for with decent benefits. Lots of great employees, but a revolving door of site leadership. Some good, some bad. Hopefully culture has improved for the better since my departure."
good,"Working at Parker can be a great experience, the pay and benefits are very competitive with, and may even exceed the other company's in the area. The company's culture is oriented toward helping each employee gain the necessary training needed to do their job at an high level. The hardest part of my job was learning all the different valves, manifolds, and test stations, as was the most enjoyable part of my job was learning the different valves, manifolds, and test stations. However, at times, I felt that management could have benefited from  a better check and balance system to govern their managers and production leaders."
good,A good place to work.  People were very nice.  Atmosphere was laid back. Worked at your own pace as long as the work got done. Flexible with family life.
good,"Here you will learn the basics if machine operations.  See what you like.  Bid on jobs you are interested in, and save your money.  When you figure out what you want to specialize in, then start looking for jobs in that elsewhere.  I would have retired from there, but we were an acquired asset.  The benefits then are gone now.  Profit sharing has been nerfed, and wages are no longer based on merit.  30 year climb to top rate regardless of skill."
good,Parker has lots of talented people that you can learn from especially in continuous improvement. They have their own Parker Lean system that is excellent.
good,"Parker's Fluid Systems Division discovered that systems engineering is more difficult and involved than expected.  Management has the usual foibles: short-sightedness along with lousy contracts.  The engineers that allow themselves to be caught up in the poor planning tend to suffer with unreasonable demands and schedules.  A typical American corporate engineering environment, however."
good,Thank you very much.     Working at Parker had its ups and downs.  Overall it is a good place to work.  People were good to work with.  To much turnover on the Aerospace Divisions.
good,its use to be a very family friendly company with great benefits and fun activities throughout the year to prevent work from getting stale. now lately its been more corporate and stale due to emotionless management and profit based work environment.
good,Excellent place lead by a great Plant Manager and true Leader.  The people here are easy to work with and everyone truly wants to do a good job.  The staff from top to bottom are good people always willing to help and make improvements.
good,"- Days are very structured"
good,I would recommend this company to my friends. There is never a dull moment. There are great coworkers. They are very lenient for someone who is balancing being a full-time student and a part-time employee.
good,The company seems to be dependent on it's reputation and designs are replications of pervious units. Testing methodology is stuck in the 70's with limited resources to modernize.
good,"Highly developed PMO, received great training and support towards achievement of knowledge and certification.  Organization definitely believes in applying the principles to daily operations.  Organization is run a bit too lean, which makes it environment highly stressful."
good,Uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar não tenho reclamações.
good,"they layoff a lot, can get warm in the summer not to bad in the winter. You will normally go home just as clean as you came in, but if you work in hydro testing you may go home wet."
good,"Parker is a large multi national firm with great opportunity to progress.  The work life balance isn't great but if your willing to put in the time and effort, you will be rewarded.  They believe in training , education and continuous improvement."
good,"Cafeteria (open during first shift), vending machines around facility, union shop, seniority based progression, gated parking, security guard on location at all times"
good,this is a great place to work. nice people to work with and upper management is great too. supervisors there are a bit laxed and not very willing to help.
good,Get your job done fast and correct and you won't have a problem. Advancement is available but you have to work hard for it. Ability to bid out of ones department was nice.
good,good place good people good money. Learned a lot of things. The work place culture was great and Management made sure we were able to participate in different events that included the community.
good,"I really enjoyed my job with Parker Hannifin, however the plant manager that I worked with, was very rude, racist, and was doing things that was not ethical nor morally right for life nor business."
good,I enjoyed working at this facility the people were nice to pay was good in the facility was clean and it was nice seeing cool in the summertime and warm in the winter time
good,"Conservative approach to innovation is a potential downfall. The people I worked with were great.  They cared about me and helped me to fit in. Management not so much. A typical day at work, go to morning group meeting followed by focused work. What I learned, Autodesk Inventor. Management, OK. workplace culture, Good. The hardest part of the job, learining procedures and policies. The most enjoyable part of the job, working with great people,"
good,I liked my job but can't work in the heat anymore. The people are nice and it's a little more slow paced place. They are fairly understanding of life situations.
good,Great company environment to work in. Workplace culture offers comfortable working environment. I had the opportunity to contribute to the success of the engineering department while working with top quality team members.
good,Training is a little lacking but job is pretty good. Some of the long time employees are stand-offish toward new employees and aren't very patient about learning curve.
good,"I got this job over the summer before starting college and it paid well. Not recommended in the summer if sensitive to heat. Decent work environment, friendly people."
good,Good pay. Need to relocate to move up. Work most weekends. Very competitive work place. Work a lot of weekends. Required to work over as needed. Upper management tiresome.

good,Tyypillinen päivä kuluu asiakastilausten ja toimitusaika seurantojen parissa mukavien asiakkaiden kanssa hyvien työkavereiden kanssa . Työssäni olen oppinut hallitsemaan stressinsietokykyäni jatkuvien nopeaa reagointia vaativien tilanteiden selvittämisessä ja parasta on saada tyytyväinen asiakas joka todennäköisesti tulee meille uudestaan . Työn hankalin juttu mielestäni on että haluaisin palvella asiakkaita vieläkin paremmin mutta aikani ei vain siihen riitä .

good,"I spent 11 years at Parker with multiple opportunities to learn new things and excellent or exceeding reviews every year while working there.

good,"Demanding but exciting when work is available.  Not a lot of new work coming in, which was the reason for the downsize. Learned how to work with people and as a team.

It started to get very hard to get any real answers for anything by management. Employees ran the shop floor. Some could do that and some couldn't  handle that. That is were a lot of employees, wished management would step in and say something. That really never happened."

As a assistant buyer you take on duties that the buyer should handle but they rather like to be lazy at Parker so you have tons of work to do throughout the day.  Nice environment but some of people in management are stubborn and can be rude. I worked at Parker for two year as a temp and I never got promoted or considered for new position.  Overall its a OK job.
good,"Parker Hannifin is a great company to work for, I am just looking for a company with more job security. A typical day is performing tool changes, work offsets, and small adjustments to programming when needed. I also try to maintain a safe, clean and organized work area. I have learned a lot about turning centers and how their tool pressures effect high precision parts. I get along with everyone at work and do well in working as a group as well as working unsupervised. The hardest part about the job is keeping parts on size and making good parts, this to me is also the most enjoyable part of my job because I enjoy challenges."

good,"In my personal opinion, Parker Hannifin is that place where I've really learnt my craft. I started on a Graduate Program and even though that wasn't without Its issues, I think they've more than made up for it by trusting and empowering me to work on some great projects where I've been guided (firm but fairly) and I've had the opportunity to experience working along side some great people. "
good,"Company with great work life balance motto.  Old school aerospace with robust work standards.  No comment on career management growth as I was a junior engineer when I started, but overall I gained skills valuable throughout my career and set me apart from my peers."
good,"Na época que trabalhei na Parker o ambiente era de cooperação entre todo e a liderança compartilhava ensinamentos. Havia também muitos treinamentos, ótimos benefícios e política de job rotation."
good,"Great place to work for an entry level technician in aerospace manufacturing. Great benefits, compensation could be better. No career advancement as a technician. Management is mediocre at best."
good,"Hardest part of the job was the priorities changed too often and the leadership at the manufacturing facilities was not very skilled in leading and teamwork, the peoples skills were lacking so it was hard for me to relate other then be directed. The easiest part of the position of Engineer at Parker Hannifin was the interaction and facilitation of Problem-solving work within multifaceted teams on issues and improvements. I learned what drivers are in the folks that make the product and who we depend on to follow process procedures and support standards and customer expectations. I learned how to work with and develop the supply base feeding into the metals and hose facilities."
good,Provided greatly for my family. Worked for Parker for 13 years in the beginning it was about their employees.. but now at Parker it's going more corporate. Plus I moved out of state or I'd still be working there.
good,tear down and rebuild moderately complex motion control units for acft and helicopters. Good training but have to go a year as contractor before direct hire which is fair. management is strict but helpful.
good,"Parker is a well rounded company but because they do not provide direction, the staff flounders to set pace or make changes. If the direction was provided they would get more from the staff. This would also provide direction for the operators."
good,"Tienen muy buena interacción con el personal en la realización de actividades de día del niño, navidad, etc"
good,"Morning meeting given by lead man. Safety issues, plans for the day, projections for today. "
good,"Always had access to tooling kits, food, break areas, and flexible work hours. I was always able to talk and communicate with my team leaders. There were seldom times where I was in need of anything and was not able to get my hands on it."
good,"Parker is a good company to work for but they pay at low end of scale and tell you their RONA(bonus) will more than make up for the less pay but it's not a set/guarantee bonus."
good,It is a good and stable place to work. There is a lack of advancement for anyone without a 4 year degree. The management staff is only concerned about themselves.
good,"I had a very positive experience at Parker.  I was able to use my work experience on very different products and manufacturing platforms.  Management listened well and there were open lines of communication.  "
good,Run orders according to schedule. I learned how to manage time better. I was in direct contact with management and they try to assist you in any way they can. They had me setting up machines and instructing people how and when to do their jobs. The people I worked with was the most enjoyable part of being at Parker.
good,I learned a lot on this job.I was a presser. Would still work for them if i wasn't laid off. Not a lot of benefits but still a great company. Had a wonderful supervisor.
good,Worked there for a number of years and liked it. The managers and staff are really kind and try to make it a great place. It is rather difficult to move upwards though.
good,"Good days and bad days. Good management and bad management. Plant manager is okay, co-workers were a little cut throat. As people started to retire and the work force got younger, the job was no longer pleasant."
good,gute Arbeitskulter und Management aber schlechte Bezahlung
good,Good people with a lot of talent. Great place for the younger people not so much for the middle to upper aged. Most missed family do to the job comes first.

good,"Bom ambiante de trabalho, profissionais responsáveis, oportunidades de crescimento."
good,"Every Saturday while working overtime they’ll bring free breakfast and they will do raffle tickets, every Friday we will have a production meeting at noon."
good,Hourly workers are awesome people. Management doesn't seem to know what they are doing. Advancement is hinted at but never actually happens unless you know the right people regardless of the quality of work.
good,"A company with strong management and discipline for every employee level. Focused on technological prowess, the company made a mark in market through its bottom-line focused approach."
good,"The experience for the most part at Parker was very good. People were wonderful but the job was somewhat stressful and fast paced."
good,"empresa seria y responsable, ambiente ameno para trabajar"
good,"A Parker é uma empresa boa para se trabalhar, aprendi muito com ela, os funcionários são dedicados."

good,"Empresa muito boa , com ótimas pessoas que estão juntas atrás de um objetivo em equipe , setores unidos e uma boa administração"
good,"Typically every day is a fast paced one; it's rare that you will ever have nothing to do. Although it can be stressful at times, the people you work with are awesome so that makes it worth it."
good,"I started at this company right out of college. I started working there  part time while still in school. I assembled our exclusive production equipment working closely with the engineer at this company. It was a small company that was later purchased by Parker hannifin. While at this company, I gravitated into different positions as the company grew. I was a machine builder, Supervisor of prodution, and later managed the Preventive Maintenance program that was required by QS9000. My main job was in the Maintenace Dept. We manufactured Molded and machined transmission parts for the Big Three.(GM,Ford & Chrysler)."
good,"- agradable ambiente de trabajo"
good,"It is fast pace workplace, and you will always know your schedule. It rarely changes, and when it does they will always give you a notice ahead of time."
good,"Company is in middle of restructure.  Most local upper management have been hired from elsewhere within the last couple years.  Going through typical belt tightening evolution, due to new economy.  Recently purged temporary employees.  Many young, college grads have transited through and on to other companies after receiving valuable training here."
good,"typical work day: Involves coordinating available labor against output needs."
good,"Brak możliwości rozwoju, monotonia pracy. Praca dosyć spokojna i przyjemna bez zbędnego stresu."
good,"Pay, benefits, co-workers, all these were great. Lower levels of management were open to suggestions and appreciated extra effort. Upper management, however, were a bunch of jerks making poor decisions. I was there long enough to see several higher offices get refilled because they got people in there who had no idea what they were doing, and didn't know how to treat people."
good,Was able to implement my Quality Engineering skills in position. Company was actively pursuing customer quality certification through Six Sigma practices.
good,Very good place to work. But they did not count any of your experience.  They only look at College Degrees.  Way too many meetings.  Would not look at real issues.
good,"Una gran empresa sin duda en la que adquiri todos mis conocimientos."
good,"The co-workers are friendly, supportive and helpful. Number based work, but is expected of a production company. Company functions were regular as well as updating meetings and keeping employees ""in the loop""."
good,"Parker Hannifin is a Global professional company that treats employees fairly and with respect. A great place to work"
good,"The most important part of my job, I felt I had ownership of my daily task. I did more then asked of me, because most of the Managers were appreciative and i enjoyed working for the company. My co-workers and I worked hard together, we helped each other as needed without one asking. The only down fall is it being a Union shop no room for advancement, ergonomics and safety could be valued more."
good,A typical day at work was very relaxing the work kept you very buisy an time passed by very fast. Manager and line leaders where very friendly and would explain assignments very well.
good,"good pay and benefits  and good environment but working third shift is not ideal and no room to advance, good location to work."
good,"My typical workday includes making sure all of the tools/ machines "
good,This business manufactures small medical devices.  Most of the work is repetitive and requires good hand and eye coordination. I like the fact that I'm making a product that benefits society.
good,"Working at Parker requires many talents and skills. Management expects a lot from everyone. It is fast pace environment that kept you on your toes. I enjoyed working with my customers and other Parker employees that assisted with quotes, order entry errors, shipping, quality and the shop.  I also answered emails and took phone calls. Answered questions the customer had, held weekly conference calls, traveled out of state to meet and greets building confidence with your customers. Provided Premier customer service listed as one point of contact. Prioritized your day many times through out the day."
good,"Mi valoración sobre esta empresa es muy positiva. "

good,"Parker is a global organisation with a strong HR culture embedded in the business. The company takes pride in its drive for empowerment and development activities and every day brings a different challenge."
good,"Parker is a great place to start a young career. Just like any other large company, room to advance is dependent on hard work and the general age of the workforce. Parker-Hannifin has also shown a recent push to keep employees happy. Although a culture change is happening, there is still a tendency to react instead of using foresight to prevent problems."
good,My typical day was from 7 am to 4 pm as a customer service representative.  I also operated the switchboard during lunches and for vacation coverage. Co-workers were like my second family.  I loved helping the customer which gave me a sense of accomplishment every day.
good,"Ik heb met plezier een collega, die met zwangerschaps-/bevallingsverlof was, vervangen."

I have learned how to operate all different kinds of machinery like CnC machines,bolt presses,drill presses.Was taught well to meet all safety requirements.Always keep a good environment for fellow employs. Always took pride in my work.The best part of the job is knowing that your customer is 110% satisfied, and knowing that you earned your money."
good,On a typical day you can get right on task if some mandatory meeting is not being held. The Administrative building provides a upbeat yet fast paced work environment. The job does come with great incentives plus majority of its employees have many years with the company. The hardest part of the job is newbies tend to be overlooked and seems jobs are given based on seniority. The co-workers were mainly all friendly and made the work day pass by with little room to dislike it.
good,good place to work with great pay but hard to get into they rarely hire.
good,Great stability and great team members. Employer is very understanding on life situations and will allow you time to handle your personal needs. Work environment is great pay is ok.
good,"I spent 1.5 years with Parker as a Lean Management Associate directly out of college.  It was an amazing experience and a great networking opportunity.  The connections I have made during my time there are still relevant today.  Unfortunately the travel schedule associated with my job placement was too much for me to handle at the time, and I had to part ways with an otherwise amazing company."
good,Loved it here but there is a serious lack of investment in machinery which means lots of backlog and pressure on shop floor staff. great people around and good focus on staff wellbeing. Unfortunately not enough focus on the real issues - breakdowns.
good,"Buen lugar para trabajar, con buen ambiente y personas extraordinarias. Con buen entorno de profesionales"
good,"Typical day is fast paced ,electro-mechanical & hydraulic flight control hardware testing. Learned DOA-160 requirements, DiAdem, Labview, & Automation"
good,I enjoyed working for this company. It was a good work - life balance. They had good pay and benefits. I liked all the people I worked with. The Management was out of touch with everything and the locations business suffered from it.
good,"Minha avaliação é referente ao período de gestão em que participei. Atualmente eles são reconhecidos como ""Melhores Empresas para se trabalhar"""
good,"not a bad place but boring work gets less challenging with time, but they have good packages for family-oriented persons, but the night shifts could be hectic and stressful"
good,I've been at parker for two years. Customers come first. They take pride in the products they make. Have good benefits. There are opportunities for overtime.  It may take a while to get hired in but it's worth it.
good,Buena empresa con buenas prestaciones y con buen anbiente laboral.
good,"sehr positive Erfahrung mit Management und Mitarbeiter/Kollegen."
good,"When arriving at work, i would ask my co worker that is in my area what needs to be done and what is left over from production etc, basically communicate with them about what to do that day. Then, i would make sure my machine is ready to operate and start working. Then, after lunch, we have a team meeting about safety and do physical exercises since you're on your feet all throughout shift. The supervisor would be there and is very communicative of the task you're doing and if you needed help he will help. Overall, a typical day at work is usually consists of communicating and making sure you're making your production quota."
good,"Testing and assembling hydrolic parts for aerospace."
good,The division I was in was fast paced and competitive. I loved it. My manager had  my back and mentored me the whole time.  I would work for them again if the opportunity came up.
good,"I had a restricted work assignment in length, but I would recommend this company to any perspective employees.  The office workers seemed to know legitimate procedures to employ to increase productivity."
good,Good place to work at great benefits and 401k plan alot of overtime which means alot of time away from the family but definatly the best pay and benefits
good,"The relationships between the employees is very good and helps get you through the day, however the job is very boring and repetitive. It is a very noisy working environment and gives you bad headaches."
good,Overall a good place with lots of overtime.  They offer 401 k with company match up to a percentage and also optional additional life insurance.   I would recommend working there!
good,"very collaborative culture, opportunity to grow, diversified so many opportunities within United States as well as Global.  Lot of long term employees , stable."
good,"Parker Hannifin is an excellent company to work for because they offer on going training and employee improvement.  They offer the necessary tools to guarantee employee success. I appreciated the challenge of meeting goals for on time customer deliveries and improvements within my department. Quality  of products was Parker's number one goal and expectation."
good,I enjoyed working at Parker even for the short time I was there. The work atmosphere was wonderful and the people were even better. I made friends whom I saw outside of work. The managers worked hard to help you when you need it and work was spread out evenly between us.
good,"just wonderful people to work with, and i had one of the best bosses I've ever had. No matter what my problem was he got it fix in very fast timing, every time."
good,"Not a bad company to work for if you can live frugally. They start you off with really low pto and sick time. If you can spend 10 years there you will be well off, as raises come pretty quickly."
good,A normal day of work is repetitive and a bit tiring but the people are good and the environment is laid back and friendly. i learned a good deal about safety in the workplace and how to find better ways of doing the work to reduce risk. the hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting required but that has been reduced greatly since i started and was easily cut in half before i left.
good,"The work would seem very typical to anyone with warehouse experience. It involves picking, packing, receiving, replenishment, and various forms of heavy equipment. It's easily the cleanest, safest warehouse I've worked at, and it has a very diverse and friendly staff. "

good,"Being a typical assembly job, the work was repetitive but not boring."
good,"Working at parker Hannifin has been very great, the performance based annual raises are not really based on performance and almost non-negotiable. People are friendly... most people are friendly"
good,I enjoyed soldering and assembling the different parts we all built. There were days we may have to stopped are job to help co-workers get the parts out to ship.  Learning a new part to build. Team leaders were great
good,Parker provided strong career growth opportunities if you were committed to work hard and work collaboratively.  The company offered a nice balance of big company opportunities with 'smaller' company feel.
good,"Great focus on training employees, many opportunities to work in a wide variety of positions throughout the United Sates and across the globe.  Company Headquarters is in Cleveland Ohio"
good,"Awesome coworkers, like family. Great atmosphere and work environment, supervisors are down to earth and accessible. Very demanding as far as meeting quota but challenging and fun. I looked forward to going to work because the people who work there make the job enjoyable."
good,"I felt that the HR was unfair on how some situations were handled, and with whom they were handled, and was very selective when it came to disciplinary procedures."
good,Good place to work. very laid back enviroment. Managment could use some help. Same issues day in and day out. management drags there feet and does nothing to fix problems. They do the same things over and over again and cant figure out why we have the same problems day after day. Even when potential solutions are brought up they dismis them. you get the feeling that they think there smarter than you and there fore dont listen to what you have to say.
good,They have a clean air conditioned facility with a nice break room. It was a low stress environment. There was lots of opportunity for advancement within the company.
good,I was able to work on a variety of different projects and there was a variety of things I was able to do. I had my own desk and computer to do the work necessary. Some of the interns were not given powerful enough to computers to do your work. Great place to start at as an internship.
good,Nice working environment with steady hours. The pay is not bad whatsoever and the management of Parker is great. The work is not difficult but definitely busy.
good,"I don't have an opinion either way. I was a temp, but at the time my mind was clouded by my outside life. I would recommend parker to anyone willing to work."
good,"will be sorely missed.  People were great, made great products, made our customers happy and were very profitable.  Poor or uninformed decision by upper management to close.  Relocation plan poorly vetted."
good,Working with team players and rotate job duties regularly
good,"no time for relaxing or socializing, all work extremely clean work place friendly people to work with, long hours more job shop style of work place, management style is more cut throat"
good,"Pleasant and friendly place to work. Competitive and safe environment. Team leads, supervisor and engineers are easy to work with. Very clean establishment."
good,"The people there are hard to work with probably due to being over worked, the work life and home life balance there is none it is all about being at work 12 hours a day 7 days a week and you volunteer for more time if you want it.  Expect to be at work more than you are at home,  Overtime is constant, if you have vacation time plan to schedule to use it weeks ahead of time or you won't get to use them due to work demand."

good,I am currently employed at Parker Hannifin as a temporary employment after leaving for something else... the few years I was there I loved it I was crossed trained on mostly all machines... I started as a temp was hired as a machine operator and became tool setter/operator shortly after being hired and after learning a good share of the company I was bounced from here to there...
good,Parker was a good place to work 50 hour weeks sometimes but overall a good place to work. I worked for the Hiawatha IA. location for 6 years and loved every minute of it.

good,"The culture and overall feel of Parker is tremendous.  Compensation is fair for the most part and my jobs have always been challenging and rewarding.  The only con I would mention would be the changing dynamic of the business world and the lean cuts and loss of perks associated with it.  This may be common across all large companies these days, but still not happy to see the changes occurring."
good,"I would recommend this job to a lot of people but hopefully they don't shut down like they did in my area. But the gift cards are excellent, paid time off, and free lunches made the job a lot better. My coworkers were awesome too I miss them! The management not so great its hard to communicate with them and sometimes they don't listen to reason."

good,"Era um trabalho tranquilo, que não dependia tanto que alguém me auxilia-se. Em relação a aprendizado deixou bastante a desejar quando entrou a segunda gerência. Em relação ao supervisor, teve um troca repentina e que acabou deixando meu cargo um pouco de lado e que parecia de pouca importância. A parte mais difícil era no fechamento, pois contava com dados de outras áreas para concluir o meu serviço e isso faz com que as vezes perdemos um pouco a paciência, pois temos prazos. É uma empresa muito organizada, ótimos benefícios para seus funcionários e um empresa de grande porte e com o crescimento aumentando cada dia mais."
good,"Handled all HR, benefits, worker's compensation and safety for a workforce of 45 employees.  "
good,"Rustige sfeer er mag gelachen worden. Resultaten zijn belangrijk en eigen input is een must. Meedenken en creativiteit tonen wordt zeer op prijs gesteld. Genoeg ruimte voor verdere ontwikkeling maar er wordt wel van je verwacht dat je hier ook zelf mee naar voren komt. Cursussen worden afwegend m.b.t de toegevoegde waarde aangeboden. Verwacht wordt dat men een HPT houding heeft en saamhorigheidsgevoel. "

good,Many differing jobs and the ability to advance.
good,"Very friendly staff, mostly of an older generation. Everyone was really nice, and we had multiple pizza parties to celebrate achievements, or when people left."
good,Excellent working at the division level. Corporate and Group interfere and do not truly empower leaders to make decisions. There is a great deal of micro-management which perpetuates the norm. Risk taking is not encouraged and decisions have to be approved at multiple levels for even routine issues.
good,"plant relocated, very nice place to worked,every day was different"
good,Go to assigned area
good,"I was a very busy bee when I first started the job. I worked for several different areas of the facility and managed the front desk. I was constantly busy. I learned about production control, purchasing, human resources, payroll, Lean manufacturing, shipping and receiving, quality and more. My co-works and I became friends. It was a small office so we were like a family. The hardest part of the job was being let go! I really liked my hours and my work and when the economy took a downturn I was the first to be eliminated. I would say I enjoyed the root of my job the best and that was greeting customers and answering the phone. Once you get to know people it makes your job fun. Reoccuring vendors and customers were fun to work with."

good,parker hannifin as a whole is a fantastic company. in machesney park il the time wasted having meetings to talk about wasted time is absurd. in my opinion HR should not exist at our location (unless we could get an individual that was not pro management). HR is there to protect management at  employee expense. 
good,"O dia a dia era bastante corrido, com negociações relativas aos pedidos, acompanhamento de relatórios, análise e digitação de pedidos e programas, acompanhamento de faturamento. Aprendi ter um bom relacionamento interpessoal, habilidades em negociação,liderança,  entre outras coisas.Direção e Gerencia competentes,e colegas bastante comprometidos.

There is drama sometimes, it's a factory it's going to happen.. the supervisor is pretty good. I recommend people to give it a shot, but only if they are willing to work. Laziness is not something that you can have and be able to do your job."

Although this is not my preferred place to work in my future. Nothing against the company but I like to be in the field, working/dealing with something new everyday, communicating with other employees, etc. Management along with everyone that worked there was very friendly, engaging, and helpful everyday. The one pro I really took from this was the overall culture of a safety professionals day. It gave me a better perspective on what I really want to pursue."
good,"It was a career for almost two decades, but numbers became more important that people. Status quo business practices changed the work culture. Management hierarchy had incompetent people in the wrong leadership positions making bad decisions for the company and the people that built the company over the years."

good,I personally have loved my experience working at Parker Hannifin.  They were my first full time salary position out of college and trained me up and taught me how to do my job effectively.  If it were not for the high level of micromanagement at my particular position I would likely not see myself searching for a new position.
good,"Work was fast paced and lots of overtime. Besides work we had outside activities like basketball, baseball and volleyball tournaments. Also got trained in different departments throughout the company."
good,"Good management,good safety,fast pace. Enjoyed unloading fright and receiving in inventory and data entry. Unloading heavy fright was the hardest because you have to be very safe and doing it. I have learned alot in receiving and being a material handler for production."

Everybody there is friendly and you get good pay, hours, and benefits."
good,"I love working for this company, and only wish that they had more work available. It is hit and miss, and they unfortunately do not have enough contracts to keep me busy in my area."
good,Empezaba el dia con un cafe y un poco de platica resolviendo pendientes cortos que tenia del dia pasado despues entraba de lleno al trabajo liberando productos y continuando mi proyecto. La parte mas dificil considero fue los primeros meses por que no me sentia asentado ni acostumbrado. Despues gracias al apoyo de mis colegas pude alcanzar esa comodidad para desempeñarme satisfactoriamente y lograr los objetivos marcados
good,This was a very enjoyable group to work with.  Very young coworkers that connected with me very well.  Also very driven to do a good job.  The hardest part of the job was balancing all the projects I was doing.  The most enjoyable part of the job was completing projects and reports and giving them to the people that needed them.

After in depth desk analysis of gases applications, identification of purities, end-users and further discussion with my colleague and our supervisor, we are required to present results and recommendations for further investigation. Helicopter view, accuracy and efficiency were a must. During my work, I realised the importance of gases in the industry and its modern applications in everyday life as I had never considered before this experience how gases can make peoples' life easier. Finally, I acknowledged the importance of working as a member of a team in order to produce efficiently valuable outcomes on time."
good,"multi-task mostly everyday, but it's challenge for me. Need to manage your project for the goal, priority. Manager or Supervisor will have a staff meeting every week for the updated, such as project, concern, things from the production line. Co-worker are friendly, they support you when you need them. Over all it's nice company, friendly co-worker, nice benifit, but like I mention it's multi-task, speacially at the end of the month"

A typical day begins with reviewing what when right and what went wrong the previous day. What can be done to address any concerns and are we on track to achieving the long term goals. I've learned to allow mistakes that leads to growth. My coworker enjoy their job and are comfortable with making suggestion to middle and upper management. The hardest part of the job was working with a short staff and not being able to do all that was warranted in one day. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with people from all groups.

good,"My total experience with the company was outstanding.  I started out in Beaufort, SC and transferred to Michigan when the decision was made to close the facility.  I absolutely loved my career until I started working under a specific manager.  Planners were normally left to do their jobs with very little supervision until we encountered the last manager.  Unfortunately, more time was spent proving that the planning department was not the blame for late deliveries, yet the real issues were never addressed.  Very unproductive and sad.  Great company.  If I only had handled the situation differently.....talked to the right people.  I loved a challenge.  When I was first transferred, I kept tell the man we reported to that I was bored and did not have enough to do until I was totally overwhelmed.  Started out shipping $700,000 worth of product to $3.5 million per month.  I still miss the environment."

good,Involved with technology transfer and development of the a new product line in the Americas
good,"This is a great company to work for, and the management is terrific.  They treat their employees well.  However, I cannot say the same for temporary employees.  The training is not thorough and the trainers are impatient and unkind.  They have gone through five temps in less than a year.  I always received good feedback from my supervisor, so I was taken aback when they ended my assignment.  I felt mislead and deceived, as there was no indication that they were dissatisfied with my performance."

good,"I begin each work day with hydraulic & pneumatic cylinder assembly. From there, I move to the inspection stand, where I verify the assembled products match the customer's specifications. This verification involves pressure testing (up to 5000 psi), the use of calipers & micrometers to measure miniscule tolerances, and the interpretation of drawings and specific order notes. Management oversees to ensure the group is meeting the daily goal. The most difficult part of the job is balancing the high volume of product against the tight specifications and quality standards, which require time, arithmetic, and accuracy. Ironically, verifying these quality standards is also one of the most enjoyable parts of the job."

good,Everyone is awesome to work with and really great . This culture of this business is amazing and I highly suggest working here. While first shift is ideal most starters work through a temp agency via third shift. Advancement is quick however if you wish to work hard.

My coworkers were not only helpful but friendly. They made the work floor a fun and relaxing environment. The only hard part of the job getting everything labeled correctly and inspected properly. The most enjoyable part was seeing a finished product go out knowing I had a part in it.

good,Parker is a great people place.  The company keeps its employees motivated.
good,Parker is a great corporation that is very organized despite it's large size. I learned a lot at my internship that I will be able to bring with me to my next position.

good,"CNC Setter responsible for the setting and the operation of 3 CNC Lathes within the hydraulics industry. Whilst there I had training on health and safety, LEAN manufacturing and cost reduction. I was not responsible for any staff below me and I reported to my line manager on a regular basis. I worked within a friendly team and also when required on my own. The hardest part of the role was the regular night shifts however the sense of achievement I gained from producing work accurately and on time made the role more enjoyable."
good,"A typical day at work consists of managing several programs at varying states of qualification and production. Some are failing, some are in development, some require cost reduction and optimization. I've learned a great deal about document control, corporate communication, and exercised my existing skills in problem solving, idea development and marketing of ideas. At the sight the management does it's job, at the corporate level the executives have great vision. The lab personnel are extremely proficient at their duties and have the work ethic of military being mostly former military. The engineering team, is sound academically but slightly lacks a large element of practicality and engineering wisdom and hence find themselves testing in circles and repeating failed attempts. The job itself is not hard at all, which is the hardest part of the job. It's hard to get motivated about ancillary products. The most enjoyable parts are the rare occasions one can get absorbed in problem solving, tinkering, prototyping, marketing, management of testing, inspiring production."
