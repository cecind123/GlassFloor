rating,review
bad,Bad place to work low paying and the health benefits are really expensive and don't pay for much of the care and unless you're a friend or family member you will never move up and make money there pay just a little more than minimum wage today and no over time unless you're one of the people who are friends with the boss just another coercion that pay the lazy people money who do nothing but site in a office
bad,"Favoritism, unfairness, cut backs, lack of professionalism with some employees, lowest pay for a luxury dealership, under manned positions, doesn’t feel like a true luxury experience, cheap, no over time, no opportunities, unable to retain solid employees, no pride,  etc...."
bad,"General Managers with huge heads and no personality "
bad,"Though your co-workers are very friendly and they can make it a decent place to work management totally wipes out any good feelings. Employees are bullied by Service Management and the GM does nothing about it. You are denied lunch hours due to appointment scheduling. Asked to work bell to bell on a daily basis, except of course if you have a personal relationship with management then you can do basically anything you want.  Basically management makes it a toxic place to work. They are continually letting people go so they can replace them with people they can pay less."
bad,"Management is nice when interviewing however after about a month be prepared to be scolded like a child on a regular basis.  Your paycheck is out of your control, they make it impossible to bring home a decent paycheck after you work close to 60 hours a week.  CSI is all they are concerned about nonetheless they make it unfesable to make good CSI.  Advisors are at the bottom of the totem pole here.  There is no one from HR in the building ever !!!!  They claim to have a open door policy which is a joke.  Penske should stop opening new stores and concentrate on what's really going on in his stores today."
bad,"Pay is super low for advisors, they will have you do loaners and cashiering as well for no extra pay..  your check is closely tied to CSI and the targets are unrealistic.. hours extremely long.. do not expect work/life balance. Typical dealership life.. work lots of hours, little vacation.. you'll make more at McDonalds working all of those hours..  you don't get paid on parts even though you are the one selling them.. "
bad,work  in Duluth ga   really  bad  parts  dept   each manager gets worst  I been at Bmw  for Years  most  people  are looking for some thing  new you don't  learn much here  as manger  is  cluless policy change daily  and  from employee  to  employee  they  run  off  all  the  good  help
bad,"Penske will pay you the least out of all dealership companies. Their hiring process takes over 3 weeks, and their dealerships are extremely slow! Other dealerships offer a better salary. They will try to start you at the bottom, even when you have multiple degrees."
bad,Hostile work environment with virtually no way of advancing. Pay isn't decent and benefits are very sparse and poor quality. Management doesn't listen to employees. Favouritism is quite rampant.
bad,"This company will tell you what you want to hear when you are in the interview. "
bad,Poor management low pay 40k or less . When you interview they promise great pay. However you will never see it. And they will change pay plans at any time.
bad,Learned how to manage time and people. Met people from different background. Developed thick skin. Learned how to manage conflict and find solutions quickly. Whoever said the car business is easy is wrong - it a lot of hard work.
bad,"Penske Automotive Group (PAG) is a great place to work if your last name is Penske, otherwise it's a cluster **** of poorly managed unprofessional ingrates competing for meager scraps tossed down from a bountiful top-level management feast. "
bad,Almost no training. Cut throat environment. High pressure unethical sales tactics in service dept. Advisors don't have tools to handle high volume. No time to spend with cust properlu explai
bad,"Good co-workers, Beautiful dealership, Poor management, Poor leadership, unable to retain solid employees. No culture, lack of support. Difficult environment. They don't care for the staff."
bad,worked  as  a tech  in Duluth  shop  work   was  good   and  lots of  work> Problem was parts  dept    slow  on bringing  parts  to  you  gave  u wrong  parts   hard  to make  money  when u wait loner  for  parts  then job pays.  This  was  brought  to  manager  and  Gm  nothing  was  done  told   that  it  the  best  they  can  do  in  parts   on guy  has  slow  as  part  of  his  name   4 for  the  tech  as  that  he  be  fired for  poor  work  sadly he  still  there.
bad,"I would not recommend working for PENSKE. First the pay is outrageously bad. Living in one of the most expensive places to live they do not pay you accordignly. The management is cutthroat and just a corporate push over. It's all about the numbers, not the employees that make the wheels turn day in and day out."
bad,"If I could give the management zero stars, I would. A complete lack of competence, coupled with a massive power trip, has made for some of the worst management I've ever seen. The manager sits in her office all day, schmoozing service directors, and has no concept of what her reps are actually doing on the phones. Everything is delegated to team leads, who don't have the training, support, or time to juggle all of their responsibilities, and are paid very little for the volume of work expected of them. The ""assistant manager"" is the definition of incompetent. As someone who started as a rep, you'd think she would have the skills and knowledge necessary to perform her job, but due to the fact that she's completely incapable of directing others, and knows nothing about 75% of the dealerships that we worked with, her duties are pretty much limited to planning potlucks and making signs. However, because there is virtually no one above the manager, there is no avenue to voice your complaints, other than HR, and they've got bigger issues to address, so tend to kind of ignore any complaints of this nature, because they are purely subjective."
bad,"Penske Automotive, in my experience was a stressful and confusing environment. The training was not very organized, the commission requirements were not across the board fair and the benefits were very expensive."
bad,"During my time here I was never given proper training by my supervisor. I was given a short time with the Temp who was in my position before me, until they moved him to another project. My director supervisor was rude when I would seek her help and favored her daughters friend (my coworker)."
bad,"Excessively poor management. Worked here for less than 3 total months due solely to the general manager and one assistant manager. Training was extremely lackadaisical. Was told when interviewing that my training would be very hands on, but ended up being sat in front of a computer and told to “learn this”. There were a few hands on training sessions with management towards the end of my tenure, but it was too little, too late. The salespersons were typically very nice and willing to help, but it is a commission position, so it was beyond cut throat when it came down to actual sales."
bad,"Intern position to eventually become a sales manager, some skills you learn are management, sales, and communication. The internship is really just a taste of becoming a sales person."
bad,"Be prepared to write up 30 R/O's a day or you can't make a decent paycheck. Management is seen very rarely. Management is never around (a lot of ""vacation days"") and when they are around, they mostly avoid you, unless there is a problem. Everyone (advisors) are on a different program. They don't care as long as you sell. Also, be prepared to upsell a lot of unnecessary work just so you can make a paycheck. Everything is commission based. No hourly or salary. Decent benefits, but everything else is a let down."
bad,"Horrible culture no training for new people and no advancement  for senior sales . Sad to watch such a great product and location go down the tubes based on poor management . Mercedes Benz of Bedford . I though it would be a great organization to work for their motto was hire the best and make it hard for them to leave . Maybe it is just the Ohio market ,but I watched every good salesman and manager leave.I doubt the CEO see's what really happens in Cleveland ."
bad,They paint a pretty picture then you realize you have been taken for a ride.started an up system with 30+ Sales people. You may get 1 chance if that per day to sell a car. It forces you to work 12 hour days to try and make a living. They won't hire porters so they use their sales staff for free labor. It's up to the sales staff to fill holes and straighten car lines. It's the worst!
bad,Abusive environment- I was one of there top producing sales people. Averaged 80 hours a week always exceeded any set work expectations and I was talked to and treated like I was dirt. The management team places little value on its sales team and treats them all very badly.If you are a top performing sales person you have better options Stay away from this company!
bad,"Penske is a great company, decent benefits etc but the one on south creek was one of the worse mechanic jobs I've ever had. The pay is bias & they DO play favorites. If you want to be treated worse then dirt. Paid lower then most competitive diesel mechanic jobs, and work a terrible schedule with the opportunities for advancement based on how much you suck up to the service manager...this job would be perfect for you."
bad,"A mediocre job, with mediocre pay, and UNFAIR policies. Fast paced work. You are merely a number. Must fight/threaten for advancement regardless of work quality."
bad,"Promotions are based on favoritism and no merit. At the Indianapolis administrative office promotions are based on who you are friends with within the office.Some one can have the same amount of experience but have a higher degree of training or education; however, friends of managers will be given more consideration. Also, management is not truthful with upcoming information as to what changes to expect."
bad,"DO NOT WORK HERE AT ALL!!! I was intending on staying with this company for the long haul, but the constant bullying and harrasment made this place unbearable for me. The current GM and Service Manager are very unprofessional and rude. I suffered from constant discrimination from them on a daily basis, and I was a very hard worker. I also suffered from an extensive amount of bullying and harrasment from the gentlemen (and I use that term loosley) in the Internal Service Department. They made it their personal daily mission to make my job unecessarily difficult and to single me out every chance they could. I went to HR multiple times with my concerns of the hostile work environment, but to no avail all of my concerns were brushed off. I tried ignoring the constant discrimination and continue on but the last straw for me was receving aggressive emails from an employee in the accounting depatment. This place was by far the worst job I've ever worked and I wouldn't wish this place on my worst enemy. Please do your self a favor and avoid this company and location at all cost. It's not worth anyone's sanity."
bad,"New and Used car departments have a couple internet sales reps. All of them get all the leads and sales come easy for them. Incoming customer traffic is rediculously slow so no matter how great of a car sales person you are you cant show it because you rarely talk to customers. Used car lot is a joke. Spend an entire 8 hour shift there and may only get 1 or 2 ups. During the week most ups are service customers. Instead of equally giving internet leads to all car sales reps to work with because most customers refer to the internet to shop for a car Penske Lexus does not care about sales associates and expect the sales person to find customers that dont come onto the lot. Most customers coming in are there to see the internet sales reps and have appointments set for them. Internet sales reps have it easy so when each rep sells 15 to 20+ car a month they act like they are the greatest sales people in the car industry. Take away there internet leads and they will struggle with the rest of the normal Car Sales associates. You would think that being Lexus a luxury brand they would distribute these internet leads to all the Car Sales people because thats how 99% of customer shop online, but nope these internet leads go to like 3 to 4 Internet Sales reps. There maybe a few top Car Salesman who have build a huge clientel over the past 10 years who do well but even they will get spoon fed by a manager here and there. If your a great Car Sales person your better off going to a dealership that distributes internet leads to all the Car Sales reps and makes it an even playing field. 1st dealership"
bad,"Penske is good please to work ."
bad,"All management cares about is money. No bonuses, no Christmas bonuses, no spouses at holiday parties. they will cut corners everywhere and trying to get a raise is like pulling teeth. been with them many years and the company has gone way downhill.  their avp is as cheap as a person gets. I’ve seen people get canned just to save a buck and then rehire someone for less money"
bad,"Long hours, not compensated correctly, high stress. Dealership management is top of food chain, treatment of lower employees is secondary. There is no room for advancement."
bad,"This job is very demanding. Long hours and unappreciated by superiors. I learned that you have to work like a robot. Also, sacrifice a lot of personal time and family time in order to stay ahead with the workload. The atmosphere at the workplace is very dreary and depressing. The hardest part of the job is feeling like you haven't accomplished anything at the end of the day. It feels like your best is never enough. Sometimes we would order lunch and have a ""down"" time session."
bad,"With the Area VP's there is no discussion of how to approach problems or how to strengthen the stores image.  The AVP in Washington is almost 70 and runs the operation as though he is a dictator.  He takes no advice from his management staff and is so out of touch with both reality and his work force.  "
bad,"I’ve emailed senior corporate management twice about my concerns that are very serious in nature. I’ve not received a response this far.  I feel I should post all of it to Facebook to see if I get a response. "
bad,The Penske Group is there to make money and cut corners.  If management isn't on your side then they are against you. The Billers do more accounting roles then bill.  non of the dealership do their paperwork the same.  Very unorganized when a biller is responsible for 2 more more dealerships.
bad,"Expected to work long shifts. Very low compensation according to national averages. Management has no experience as a manager, has been successful for many reasons (Austin is in a boom), but not because of experience. Management does not care about employees (this is evident through low retention rates, suicides within the company, 1 vacation day a year, no breaks allowed). Most customers are incredibly rude, coworkers are also rude, and expect you to do way too much for them."
bad,Okay to be employed as a stepping stone to get where you want to be but would not recommend anyone who is well into their career to apply with this company. Management does not manage properly and lie through their teeth when corporate comes around.
bad,Management was stealing money from the company...I was not properly trained on my job or its duties. No help was given by management. It really is a dog eat dog world.
bad,"Most people think that being a service porter is moving cars around and parking them in designated spots throughout the dealership, however this is just the main duty. Outside of this, you are also at the bottom of the barrel and work for everyone in the dealership, so be prepared to be tasked with everything outside of your job description every 5 minutes. You'll be fixing things the service advisors and/or supervisors forgot to do within their job description and become everyone's personal butler. You do get to work with one other porter which can be nice if they show up on time and are a hard worker like yourself. The hour you get for lunch is a plus, especially working 10+ hour shifts. Overtime must be approved. Lunch is paid for on Saturdays. You'll have to work alternating weekends."
bad,"Over populated sales floor makes it necessary to work a minimum of 55 hours per week to achieve bonus numbers.  Mandatory to work most holidays, making family life difficult."
bad,Typical day was getting out reports and assisting the management team of one of the north east areas of the company.  I gave administrative support to four managers/executives.
bad,The company is okay. Management is nice and helpful. The benefits are not good. The pay schedule is semi-monthly. Since I left there has been many payroll mistakes. Benefit payments were deducted from my checks and I wasn’t yet eligible for benefits. My final paycheck was shorted almost all of my hours. I called on a Friday and was told they can’t help me until Monday. Inconvenient.
good,"I sold over $350,000 of vehicles and made an average of $100 per sale, while averaging a 60+ hour work week.  There is a minimum quota to make on selling at least 12 new cars (management would give customers lowest prices = low commission) before you are allowed to sell used cars (significantly higher commission).  By the time you sold the 12 new cars your month was almost up. Not worth my time nor worth the money."
good,"Penske Automotive specifically the PAG group is difficult to wrk for.  They tell you they encourage your thoughts and recommendations on process improvement, but shut you down before you can fully present your idea.  The management team is afraid to go against the Controller for fear they will loose their jobs.  Bot a pleasant work environment."
good,This company does not allow for any input from the lower level employees; the management is poor and the communication is very low. The reviews are not done fairly with aspects of real work.
good,"On a typical day, I would be calling customers from the proprietary data of the company, encouraging new sales growth.  Develop and extend rapport with existing clients in data base.  Prepared to assist in loaner cars, customer management and coordinate problem resolution with service staff and service managers.  Including greeting customers from the time customer entered the dealership and enhancing the customer experience beyond expectations."
good,"Large company, but management is too localized no continuity in business plan. No training provided, benefits provided were below par. Local management didn't have a clear path, trial by error was standard operating procedure."
good,"Typical day working as a Penske employee wasn't very rewarding or filled with happiness. I worked for Penske for a little over three years and I have experienced the bitter sweet feeling of work. over the years I have watched the happiest people wither in their seats. I learned everything to the best of my ability in this work place. I knew everything to the point my co workers in other departments would override my supervisor to get a correct answer. This made our relationship bitter and hard to work side by side due to my relationship with everyone else. The management here is by favor, not merit. The hardest part of this job became waking up for it."
good,This job had very little room for advancement. The boss showed favoritism to certain workers. The are very loud and unprofessional and get many complaints. A
good,"The Penske way is only a philosopy, not a practice. Kissing up was a pre-requisite to advacement. Training and learning was productive and helpful for employees to excel at their duties."
good,Management created a hostile work environment; favorites were played;the dealership has potential to be great with the right people running it.  Certain folks receive preferential treatment.
good,"I have been with the company for one year and I am already starting to look for another job. As a Lube Tech at the Wolfchase Toyota store in Cordova, TN, I have seen a culture that does not seem conducive to growth as an automotive technician. Low level employees are not presented opportunities to grow because any opening is filled with people from outside. Hollow promises of advancement have been made to several coworkers and have not been fulfilled. They hired 6 new technicians (5 lube tech, and one advanced maintenance tech) when business was already slow, cutting into the wages of the other employees that were already established in those roles. Recently our hours have been cut. I was hired with the expectation of working 10 hours per week of overtime and that has been cut to almost zero overtime without any forewarning. Doing the math, it will end up being approximately a 14% cut to my gross pay without even an explanation. It feels like they do not care about the employees."
good,"I have worked for several of Penske's dealerships, some good some god awful. Just know that having the right managers will make or break a store. Everything is done the Penske way, which is at a snail's pace. You won't start until a month after they tell you your hired. Moving forward with the company can be done, but you need to do sufficient hoop jumping and cozy up to the right people."
good,"Penske Automotive Group is a professional company to work for. They take care of their employees by providing full time benefits, paid holiday, sick days, 401k etc.. PAG has a large amount of dealerships around the valley that are virtually run the same way, but always have a little twist depending on management at that dealership. For the majority, managers are interested in the success for their employees and try to provide a positive and successful workplace. PAG is a great company to work for if being in the car business is what you want as a career path."
good,Company does promote from within. Hours are not good as with most dealers. Upper management does not listen to to lower management positions regarding pay and some department heads. Left the company because of those two things and could not be happier.
good,"Unfortunately there is little to no room for advancement, and the low salary does not meet the needs of my growing family. More for less should be there slogan. "
good,Overall decent place to work at. Better then some other companies doing the same type of work. Management could be much better (lazy sometimes). Working on brand new vehicles with some drive time but not over 2 years old usually.
good,"There are parts  about this company than need's work people skills, other stuff like that. The talking about people behind there backs the just stupid office stuff. Other then at it's a okay place to work at."
good,My manager was great but had little help from other floor management. Training not enough as had to be on spot immediately. Co-workers great but stressed and underpaid. Really underpaid for expectations.
good,was a fun day with the guys always working there always learning new things about diesel engines. was kinda shady dont think ill go back to penske at all
good,It is a sink or swim type company depending on the department your in. What makes this job enjoyable is the people you work with. The hardest part of the job is communication  with different departments.
good,Life outside of any car dealership is non existent. Literally.
good,"This company is ran buy a very greedy man that loves to see his name on everything. He cares less about his employees and more about his stockholders. There has been multiple pay cuts in The Last 5 Years, often multiple pay cuts in one single year. You do not get vacation time off until after your first year. At that time you receive five paid days off for vacation. Not until your 3rd year do you receive 10 paid days off for vacation. At your 5th Year you receive 15 paid days off for vacation. It is common to work 9 to 12 hour days. If you do not perform well you will be replaced at the drop of a hat. If your customer satisfaction surveys do not meet the minimum, you will be replaced. This company pays less then industry standard. Insurance benefits are very expensive. Retirement is matched up to 5%. Discounts are rare."
good,Corporate culture has a difficult time recognizing individual efforts and more often than not rewards complacency and complaining. Creativity can get shut down quickly because “that’s not how we have done things before” mentality.
good,ok place to work as far as job security goes. Not a lot of room for advancement in maintenance or technical field but you learn a lot and learn to work independently. its what you make out of it.
good,very competitive environment hard for new employees to feel accepted.  Long hours commission only.  Union provides good job security.  very hard to advance.
good,decent automotive group not the best othe ones are better in my opinion to each is own nice people work there certain locations cater to certain demographics
good,Penske Automotive Group/United BMW of Roswell is a busy shop with some opportunity to grow within the business
good,"Management is good. Executive management is supportive. Good training and employee camaraderie. Pick your own birthday cake on your birthday every year! Year end outings. Executive management brings in Dunkin‘ Donuts once a month. Also ice cream truck in the summer."
good,Focus has fallen from best trained and most knowledgeable employees in the industry to people who will get the job done for the least amount of money.
good,Great organization great benefits work stability for employees worked in Jersey city Nj hours were horrible would come in at 9am and work well passed midnight on holidays would work most of the day even when supposed to close at 6 would leave pass 9 on holidays such as New Year’s Eve 4th of July.. felt if it was more family oriented company would should make exceptions on these days especially with a labor intensive work schedule of 70 plus hours . Very well organized and great work environment but could not get passed long days and long weeks with children at home
good,"Job is stable, decent hours, easy job. Managers are nit picky and lazy, there are a lot of issues with the company that no one seems to want to fix. They only move up people who shut up and smile and don't want to listen to anyone who actually wants to make a difference. Good for anyone who just wants a mindless 8-5 Mon-Fri type of office job, not for anyone who actually cares or wants to make a difference."
good,"i enjoyed working there for the few months i was there. I did come through a temp agency but was expecting it to be temp to hire. I was trained in my last three weeks to take over a position for an employee that was going to be out for a few weeks and also had to train someone to do the job i was previously doing. I was told that they liked my work ethic and my personality but as soon as the person i was filling in for came back they had no position open for me. instead of telling me directly my assignment would be ending, they went through the temp agency and acted like they may or may not have something for me. very unprofessional from what i experienced with them directly."
good,Was a good first mechanic job. I started as a lube and tire tech. Turned into light engine work and suspension work. Ended with them doing alignments.
good,"Gained experience in the call center, good place to work, good workplace culture, the hardest part that I did not have experience in call center nor the terminology"
good,when I worked there it was awesome had the most wonderful boss ever! reason I left is because manager no longer worked there so I looked for new adventures! I will miss working there with my manager. company is not good
good,"great management, really help people to advance and make money. coworker are all really nice people. hardest part is dealing with the weather."
good,"I truly enjoyed working here.  It's a shame they do not rehire regardless if you left on good terms.  Pay was great, and management was very supportive.  The benefits were not great.  My husband and I with our daughter was paying almost $700 a month for healthcare that didn't cover anything.  We had a 10k deductible and could never reach it."
good,place ran well for over a year upper management moved supervisor out and put in place someone with no experience and the place fell apart. our site was busy then dead inconsistent work loads
good,"Great pay, but no solid job security, be prepared to be let go at any time for any small reason. Sometimes no reason at all and they will give you the boot. I've worked here for some time and have been witness to its high turn over. Other then that its a descent place to work!"
good,I learned a lot of information about cars to be a sales person that earned a living on a commision only based salary. My co workers were awesome!
good,there would usually b a couple of cars waitning already as the morning starts. the day would be pretty busy until 2 o'clock. Then we had to look for more work if you want to make your daily hours
good,I loved my coworkers not really the job. But I would go back. It was easy. The job was fun and I thought it was very repetitive. But good. Would recommend for someone barley starting
good,Typical day at work consists of making 20-30 phone calls per day. Check 70-90 emails per day and also send 30-40 emails. Learned to close deals and work with sales managers to close. Hardest part of the job is the hours the most enjoyable part of the job was the comradere.
good,Have established a loyal clientele following at this dealership.  I am constantly in demand with my responsibilities and customers.
good,It was a great place to work and great people to work with. It was fast paced with a little stressful moments but the coworkers were what made it worth it
good,To many people wanting to be the boss but great company to work for and there  are great people you will meet as co workers and clients that come to the dealership but there is some stress factors.
good,"Hanging with bunch of great Sales people , enjoying work with people , Automotive knowledge and discovering new brands , potentials ,  meeting with extremely interesting individuals"
good,"Learn a lot on first few weeks, but learning curve gradually evens out."
good,My job was to get auto financing for folks with credit issues. Very rewarding and a lot of fun.
good,"Advancement opportunities for those who speak up, fast paced, and modern/clean facilities to work in. Being a luxury complex removes the cliche' ""Car sales"" feeling that you get with other dealerships"
good,"Fortune 500 company. Fast paced. If you can't learn quickly on old systems, you will not survive. Large team with structure. Can easily get stressful if you cannot keep up."
good,Fellow employees and management were great. The only issue I had was the work itself at the reception center. It was incredibly boring and monotonous.
good,"Car sales hours are tough. On the flip side they are flexible if you need time off or need to attend to the family."
good,"Responsible for being a receptionist as well as a file clerk."
good,"I was at PAG for 20 years, started in dealerships and moved up to corporate MIS dept."
good,Great place to work and advance in your career.....
good,"great place to work, loyal, quality, family and customer first ."
good,Had an awesome yet very challenging experience. Got to travel and work in different locations. Management was open minded. Very tight with financials and processes.
good,not bad for a large dealer group. good opportunity for advancement. good pay. average benefits. poor work life balance. high pressure environment. very political.
good,It's really fun working here but there are times where you can get stressed out over a task. The good thing is that my supervisor and manager are always there to guide me through whenever I face any obstacles
good,"Very fast paced, accounts receivable for multi dealerships, demanding position. Enjoyed working with the people, great team."
good,"The structure of the business was not that great. He went from k care, automotive, a division of Kmart To Michelin Auto Ctr. to Penske auto center and then they closed all of the businesses"
good,Although it was very stressful I truly enjoyed helping employees always.It was also a bit of a distance for me to travel daily.Overall I didn't have a problem doing the job but needed to be closer to home for family reasons.
good,I am the first intern ever at the Autopark and I switch every week to a different department to gain a better understanding of how Penske operates as a whole. Every single person I have shadowed in the last seven weeks has been not only helpful and informative but friendly as well. I can not recommend this job highly enough.
good,"Lots of variety, every day was different. "
good,I love coming into work everyday with a big smile on my face! Everyone is great and a typical day is long!
good,I enjoyed working at J Crew. The customer service focus is awesome and my managers and co-workers were great.
good,"It’s sale, you have to be competitive, aggressive and on your toes all the time."
good,"Loved working here, good people and great opportunities for advancement.  Lots of benefits to working for a large dealer group, Penske is well known and respected."
good,Although I very much enjoyed working for Penske and enjoy the automotive industry.. Penske pay is horrible.  Their Management is horrible.. Work 8-12 hours a day and you bring home a paycheck. I was lied to about why I was fired.. What they say I didn't can not be done.  I spoke with 3 financial directors who agree it can not be done.  I must've looked at the Boss the wrong way and she'll get rid of you.. that simple.
good,"Great place to work, room for advancement. This was the only company I worked for that did not have yearly reviews but overall PAG is a great place to work in the Automotive field"
good,Overall a nice company to work for.  Some of the stores do nice things for their employees.  Some great people work there and truly care about the emloyees.
good,Great place to work - terrible pay and zero advancement opportunities. once you get hired they want to keep you in the same position forever. Need more opportunites
good,"Great Company to work for, Management believes believes in growth and encourages promoting within the Company."
good,This store is a in a very difficult location.   It has a ton of potential and growth opportunity.  Hopefully with some proper staffing it will improve.
good,Penske provides lots of opportunities throughout the country. Management is very supportive and encourages growth from within. Great company to start your career with and retire with.
good,"It's a good company run by great management, all computers and equipment are up to date. If you do good you would go up."
good,"Great team!"
good,"From the top to the bottom everyone supports each other. The environment is amazing pay is amazing.. only down side be prepared to work... like every other sales manager position."
good,Penske Automotive Group has and is an organization that considers all aspects of the spectrum.

good,"I enjoyed working at PAG.  I wished there was more time in the day because there was so much work to do and overtime had to be approved in order to continue work.  The drawback is having to leave good people's systems not working when my 8 hour-work day was over and having to continue on the next day per employment policies.  Other than that, great managerial staff.  My immediate supervisor allowed me to work autonomously after I learned the basics.  Of course, I was prone to messing up here and there because I had a ""just get it done"" mentality and should have consulted my supervisor more often, but I thank my supervisor for allowing me the room to mess up and learn.  Sure he got mad at me a few times, but he helped me figure things out...You don't get that that often.  I appreciate them taking me in and allowing me to grow in order to jumpstart my career in another workplace.  If the pay is right, I'll submit my resume to them once again. Thanks PAG!"

good,"It was a blast when I first started there and management found unique ways to create incentives for employees. A typical day involved a lot of phone calls, emails, training, and selling some cars. Never working in sales before I was extremely nervous working a commission only job, but I was given the tools needed to succeed. The hardest part of the job really is the hours but if you have a positive environment it can make it worth it. My favorite part of the job was helping get someone get their credit reestablished/ getting started and making new connections. Oh yeah and the money was pretty good!"
