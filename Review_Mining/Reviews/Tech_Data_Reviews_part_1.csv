bad,"Long working hours, mid night calls with global team every night.  Even demand you to work during holidays and vacation.  Bad management with no transparency and communication."
bad,"No proper training, the long timers don't want to be bothered with new employees. Everything is""oh, you'll learn as you do it""! I have nothing good to say about my experience here"
bad,Tech Data has a horrible culture and management style.  There is NO work life balance.  Little to no training is offered.  Employees are frequently yelled at in public for the slightest mistake.  Management hounds employees for the slightest mistake for weeks.
bad,"This was the worst place I ever worked.  I had so many managers I lost count.  It is riddled  with fifedoms and back stabbing.  The management style was managing through negative reinforcement.  The one and only ""bonus"" I  got was actually taken out of my pay.  It was so small  I did not notice the difference in my paycheck.  It was for working a 14 hour shift to bring the entire data center back up after the fire marshal cut  all power and it went dark.  I was in the hospital 3 times due to the stressful environment. "
bad,don't ever work there its very stupid and the workers suck the people have no respect for anyone and they don't know how to train you and they cuss and they are very rude
bad,"Sadly not a company for me."
bad,Hot place hated it. I thought it was a great place. But after being there. It wasn't. They only care about productivity. Its crazy when their no work n u standing around. So ur number goes down.
bad,Great place to work if you have no other options. Over-worked & underpaid. If you are signing up to work in Sales - ask about !all! condition on promised bonus. Sometimes your bonus will be enough for a pack of cigarettes.
bad,The director of the building is a hot head and will always talk down to people. Things always had to be done his way. They treat you only as a number and not a person. They also don't set you up for success.
bad,"Tech Data's accounting department is a  dodo chute. I wouldn't recommend this job to my worst enemy. Training is terrible and often help is given by disgruntled, underpaid, and overworked employees. Down sizing is a thing and you will be cut if Tech Data does not reach its yearly projections. This develops a culture of knowledge hoarders who aren't interested in sharing for fear of job loss to a more capable mind. If you are interested in pestering fellow co-workers, you might excel here, but you still won't be compensated. The place encourages a lack of communication among team members by allowing employees to wear headphones (enjoy your sound of silence). Wear lots of cologne because this usually awakens the zombies that work around you. However, they will not talk to you, only fellow zombies who too were awaken by your pleasant aroma (I recommend wet dog if you want to appease those sitting in your cell block). Be sure to greet those around you because even though they have been there for 20 plus years they will likely not say a word to a new face. In all seriousness, management is not that great. The managers are nice and all, but don't expect any great leaders to be leading you in their charge. If you can, work anywhere else, I mean literally anywhere."
bad,"They say one thing and do a completely different other thing. It's like living in office space. And the benefits are a joke!!! For instance it takes two years to be vested in the 401K, There are no sick days...you have occurrences...If you have more than six you get written up. Even with a dr's note. I had that really bad flu that was going around and had to stay home for a week and got written up.Even when I showed a doctors note and my prescription. The dental plan is a rip off, they won't cover major work (nd they decide whats major) for a year. But you still pay the same ammount, as you would if they did.I had a root canal and a deep cleaning, it cost me out of pocket 1,500.00 dollars. They wouldn't even cover my teeth cleaning, because they considered it periodontal work. They won't cover anything to do with your gums for a year. Again you still pay the same price as if they did cover you. "
bad,"I was one of the quicker and more skilled employees there that could float between multiple departments. My productivity was electronically rated and I constantly made 120%.  There was no raises given out while employed 3 years.  The conveyor system constantly broke down, forced to work solo in areas ""zones"" that were specified ""team lift"" areas.  If you asked for repeated help and would not follow orders Tech Data would phase you out and fire you. Extremely taxing on the body.  Prison like facility with lizard people admin and lazy warehouse workers who get promoted to higher positions for being incapable and stupid."
bad,"Looks like my last review got rejected so, one word sums up this place! Ghetto Data!  Horrible everything, little to no training by bitter employees, horrible management which doesn’t recognize the worker and just threatens you, the list goes on and on!"
bad,"Processing sales order in order to release purchase order to vendor. The management is quite flexible but the team lead is quite chaotic. It is understandable that the nature of the business is rushing in order to capture the revenue for the month end/quarter end, but when obeying too much to sales person request even if it is after closing time is unreasonable."
bad,Place is under staffed and they will use you until you leave. The employee turn over is ridiculous......................................................
bad,"Job used to be enjoyable and easy enough until they hired Henry, a completely useless two faced manager, literally fired like 11 people in 3 months has no idea what he's doing never pays attention to his team, curses around the team and disrespects you. The real leader of the team was the lead who does a great job of picking up Henry's slack."
bad,Bad place to work top out at $13 an hour at fontana/ bloomington warehouse managemen2 has no idea on what to do or how to manage people avoid xdcj or crossdock at all cost especially if your manager is henry doesnt know how to run area...the lead runs the area...over worked and under payed job...12 hours a day including saturdays.
bad,"A lot of turnover on the team I was on anyway. Being a Fortune 100, execs care more about the sales than the people on the front lines - the employees."
bad,"I was brought on as a contractor after moving to the area from out of state and was thoroughly unimpressed and disappointed with the lack of structure and competence in the management. There was no cohesion between Software Development ""factions"" or the business, there was no real training to speak of, no clear path or direction in which to take but a plethora of political maneuvering and a highly toxic company culture. I was very disappointed that the position I was hired for did not turn out to be at all as advertised. I knew things were going to go back when one Project Manager ""intercepted"" me as her direct report ""on a whim"" after 2 other new hires were to start on the same day, but never showed and I was alone. Later I discovered that there were initially 3 other people that we scheduled to start on 3 different dates but had either went back to their old jobs or had moved on to other positions due to being misled about their start dates. This occurred to me after weeks of discussion with my expected Supervisor just because she was favored the department head. Despite this, I still tried to make the best of what opportunity I had, though once my newly assigned PM asked me ""Can't you just mix the dot Nets and the PHPs together?"" I knew that I had very little chance of success. My contract was rescinded the same week I stuck up for myself and my professional integrity. This is not a great place for developers to work. I suggest that Tech Data outsource their development efforts to a more capable and competent B2B technology partner as they do with most other products."
bad,Very unfair with the workers will use you as much as they can then let go when they feel your no longer needed they have favoritism and you are required to do more work than what they explain to you what you’re job title is
bad,"I was put into a position with a complex technical environment with no training and was ask to do the work. I had no voice and anything that I asked for was not granted, even if it was not for me but to improve the business. The hire professional with experience but don't listen to them. I will not work there again."
bad,"The overall morale is very low due to continuing layoffs and cost cuts. "
bad,"If your an uppty class person and enjoy that type of culture you will enjoy most of the people there. Stay away from marketing or events team in particular as they are a tuff croud to judge, throw you under the bus and petty politics. This company prides itself on inclusion and in my experience i never felt more un included with my so called team. "
bad,The only decent thing I can say about this company has to pay scale wasn't bad. But I have never worked in a more mismanaged operation in my life. Zero communication from management. The benefits are lackluster and severely overpriced. Total waste of almost a year of my life.
bad,"To say that the management team plays favorites could be the understatement of the year.  The management team has basically a good old boy networking mentality that is short sighted and routinely unfair. There is no strong leadership or accountability.  This company is a Fortune 500 company and can't stay properly staffed because of the reputation that they've rightfully earned by mistreating employees. This leads to regular and often unnecessary 12 hour shifts, a poor work environment, and a large enough employee turn over ratio that would even empress the biggest fast food chains.  Also, The pay is decent only because they have to overpay to stay in business.  There is only room for advancement if you have a manager in your corner. Qualities like reliable, hard working, honest, and efficient is more overlooked or blatantly ignored than not."
bad,this company is not in favour of the welfare of its employees. They treat you as a criminal because you are sick. Plenty of discrimination. HR turns a blind eye to any reports filed by lower level employees. HR sides with management and does nothing to resolve disputes.
bad,Not kept up to date on accurate company situation. Laid off with no warning to start searching for new job. Weeks of no calls then weeks of non stop calls. Company had no real plan for their field techs. 90 tech's laid off 3 weeks before Christmas. Tried to lowball on severance.
bad,"The sales floor appears to have lost its way compared to all other departments. A lot more seasoned employees are quitting or moving on.  Unless you are placed on a ""lucky"" team, then you are more than likely going to deal with a toxic work environment. Management shows obvious favoritism. It is a numbers crunching game where skills such us organization or creativity will get abused but not recognized. I wouldn't let any supervisors know about health problems (physical or mental), because it gets taken advantage of or spread around the office. I saw a handful of team members leave because they felt unsafe about their privacy and told to poor work first.  There is often lots of free food and training available,  but sales teams will pressure you to skip break or not take advantage of the opportunities around you because it's a team over personal development mindset. Make sure NOBODY finds out if you want to switch to a different department. Management might tell you that they support internal transfers,  but many people feel pressured to leave for a new job because there is a 1.5 year requirement. Workers get treated differently if they don't show blind loyalty to sales.  There is also a trend of pushing good workers to internal positions that may not use their skillsets efficiently only to lock them down in the department longer.  If anyone has watched as many Ted Talks as I have, my advice is to be very, very cautious if you are a Giver. People who are Takers or Matchers will move up quicker and be rewarded much better. The company has not figured out how to pinpoint their"
bad,When they hired me they promised 40 hour work weeks.  It only took two weeks to go by before they changed it to 80 hours a week.  They would take your days off just hours before finishing a shift.  They placed hirer concern for their client Xerox than they did their own employees.  I was even told the day before fathers day (a Sunday) that I would have to work to fulfill Xerox orders. There is no consideration for worker family needs.
bad,"For such a large company Tech Data especially the LATAM Miami office is a complete, disorganized mess."
bad,Since Tech Data has taken over we have have gotten no support. The depart has been short staffed and Tech Data  has only focused  on sales  to make their number look better  but their service as only suffered.  They have pushed the department  so far service  has suffered and the health of the employees has been effected.
bad,"Typical smile and your face and stab you in the back mentality. Bitter, busy, messy, gossiping, desperate, frat guys,gals, and their cronies. If you are skillful and persistant, they will make it their duty to prove it otherwise."
bad,"Some managers  need to be replaced, but are protected by HR.  The group I worked in was constantly threatened about losing their job if they didn't work harder.  The goals are random and changed if you are making too much, or too little."
bad,"Where to start..... This place is a joke when it comes to their policies. You don’t get anywhere here unless you kiss but. Receiveing managers are a joke they talk down to you and talk about you until you hear about it all they wanna do is apologize. If you kiss but here and drop some freight you will not have to take a drug test for sure. But if your on the bad side of management you’ll differently have you take a drug test all managers in different departments have their favorites. Main policy there is make sure you report a accident or you will be fired on the spot, that’s a lie people do it all the time just depends if management likes you. Shipping department is cool you get hours there. Stay away from receiving and slotting department management is a joke. When you do complain about someone in management to the higher ups they just laugh and say that’s not happening but there not out there on the floor as much as we are company is a huge joke. They do hook you up with food at the company only best thing that’s out of that company. Seriously STAY AWAY!!!!!"
bad,"When hiring new employees that you promise to mentor, mentor them. This is a sink or swim environment and not fitting for Jr. Developers. Revolving door."
bad,"They hired me and told me to start on a Tuesday. I came in and they said I missed my induction which was on the Monday. I said ok they got the letter wrong, to which i got no reply from the emails and calls I made to ask for the revised start date. Then a week later someone called to get me to verify references, no apology for my time they wasted or to even acknowledge I should have already started. On top of that, they expect you to work 12 hour days and weekends, so say goodbye to your social life. Avoid at all costs."
bad,A company that has bad communication skills and has a lack of leadership and direction amongst the management staff. There's also a lack of trust amongst upper management and lower managers. However the company does try to provide everything they can for their hourly employees.
bad,Stressful faced paced environment. have to go through metal detectors in and out of the warehouse floor even though managers can have them and scroll on facebook and text each other during work hours. usually working late due to lack of employee help and conveyors shutting down almost every 30 minutes.
bad,"Although company has been around for many years, constant shuffling of positions leads to layoffs.  But Duluth office was casual work attire and able to bring kids into office with you.  Can't comment on Clearwater, FL corporate office."
bad,"Typical corporate company: hiring freezes, layoffs, decent benefits but could be so much better, employee treatment varies vastly depending on your department and manager."
bad,"Very strict attendance policy, even if it is for medical emergency reasons. Was only allowed three days to miss in the event of emergency, illnesses, etc. Had to reach quota or it would be counted against you. Often worked through lunch, came in early, and stayed late. No balance between personal life and professional life."
bad,"TechData is a great company and I really liked the overall company culture, but the specific project I was hired to do was working with software that I knew very little about.  "
bad,I honestly would never apply again.  They treat people badly. I got sick really bad and received points. Written up for productivity.  My health care insurance didn't cover my bill. Stressful.
bad,Management suck and a racial element to their decision on how they handle employees. The workplace culture was very intense because lower management had little experience of dealing with different people.
bad,"Worked as a contractor for an IT related project.  This was by far the most toxic work environment that I have been in.  Management works in a silo, often making decisions and not informing the team.  You are often instructed to not inform people project status and work in constant fear of your job."
bad,"Management don’t care you express concerns they come back will look into it They don’t !!!"
bad,"They do not offer consistent pay increases from manager to manager or from employee to employee. It is based on their personal interactions with you, not your performance. Current area pay for unskilled labor is much higher than the skilled repair tech positions that this company hires for, therefore they have been hiring less skilled laborers and not rewarding the competent ones."
bad,"I was set apart from the rest of the team and picked on. The ""team"" was incredibly cliquish and management would not listen to grievances. Also there was little to no communication or direction if you were not part of their little clan."
bad,"Basically, if your manager likes you they will cover for you, promote you, advance you, etc. If they don't like you, everything you do is wrong. This is why they keep losing people every couple of months."
bad,Very difficult place to work. Absolutely no work/life balance. No regard for the employees. High volume business that uses you until they can replace you.  High turnover for employees and managers. Pay is okay but still lacking for this area.  It’s sad. The company could be so great. But it’s all about quantity over quality. Company is extremely top heavy for employees.
bad,"Please don't work here,  ""family domain class"" of entrenched employees will make your life miserable. This is not a good place to work. It's horrible work atmosphere, feeling of ""why am I here or what am I doing here"""
bad,"Die sogenannte amerikanische Firmen""Kultur"" beutet ihre vordergründig ach so geschätzten Mitarbeiter aus bis zum Umfallen. Work-Life Balance gleich null und ein Nein bei Überlastung wird als Schwäche ausgelegt. Chaotischer Führungsstil, welcher immer zu Lasten der Mitarbeiter geht. Cliquenwirtschaft ...Buckeln und Treten. Rate dringend ab !!"
bad,"The numbers are priority & the senior management team (not all, but majority) see their staff as disposable and easily replaceable & will have no qualms about throwing their team under the bus to protect themselves."
bad,"This company is about making money at the expense of it's employees.  The only way to advance is to know some one, and the company keeps a frat house mentality."
bad,"Management is not good, and the culture is very very closed.  They do not have much diversity at all.  They pay is not great and many teams do not get a long with each other.  That is the reason I left because i couldn't stand my team after working with them for 5 yrs"
bad,"They need to work a lot with their leaders and teach them how to motivate and manage people. They are leaders only by title. Improve their compensation package, it is way low vs market benchmark. Highest turnover in the type of industry, you need to work every 2 months with new people, explain them the process and you waste a lot of time."
bad,Lots of politics to advance. You have to know someone or quickly find one of the few talented Sales Managers to work under or else you can work very hard and go nowhere.
bad,Not a bad place if turnover wasn't so high but there is never enough people to get the work done. Instead there is quite a bit of mandatory overtime passed around to burn out those that stay.
bad,"Management sucks, blatant favortism. Didn't fairly compensate employees. The work hours were inconsistent. The people who were taking risks and extra responsibilities were not getting more compensation than the people who were on the ground doing less."
bad,Came in as a temp to hire after 90 days.  Have yet to be hired on.  I do not receive paid time off or health benefits. Pay is very low.  Company itself is very disorganized.  They do not have system training you just kind of have to figure it out as you go.  The employees have all been very nice and helpful. I also do not see much opportunities for advancement.
bad,"The days were repetitive, slow, and cold due to the lack of moral within the different departments in the company. Management seem to be unconcerned or confused about moral and safe productive work environments. The hardest part of the job I would have to say was the hours(Long). But the overtime was there and I did enjoy that."
bad,"I've worked there for 8 months, and in those 8 months, 8 people have left/let go from our team. This puts additional work on the other 5 analysts. This seems to be not normal, but it has made the experience awful. Advancement is not available for you unless you've been there for over a year, even in the circumstances of learning 2 or 3 other positions on your team that are levels above you. Culture is also not great. Everyone just minds their own business, and has their headphones in. Management doesn't seem to really know whats going on with the team. The high amount of turnover is likely a reflection of management. Hardest part of the job was taking on an analysts 3's responsibilities at 2 months into the job while still training for the analyst 1 position. The most enjoyable part of the job was the knowledge I was gaining."
bad,Not an ideal place to work.  Not everyone get recognized for the work they do.  Dept. managers favor only those involve in brown nosing.
bad,"The opportunity for advancement depends on who you know, not what you know or your skilled set."
bad,"High stress, cut throat and politics.  Long hours which is expected with sales, but pay is low for what the company expects from you.  A lot of changes with company due to company merge."
bad,Manager needs tired.  It a classic the inmatevrun the prison.  They need fired and management .... Heather needs fired.  If certain people go it can be great place
bad,"Tracking the equipment "
bad,Management is very poor can't get no help less you go HR they will send a e- mail to your supervisor. Your leads is always sleeping on the job and supervisor always trying to have relationship with the employees.
bad,The place was a disaster. My last month the worst. Barely got 40hrs. They over staffed. Then fired about 15 people. No notice. Management had no clue how to manage.
bad,"Al centralizar la mayoría de las tareas de diferentes países en Barcelona, se aprende a gentionar el tiempo, las tareas y la presión."
bad,Management was awful. They did not care to sit down and talk to me about training. I was fed to the sharks and had to help at all unless from people that felt bad for me for lack of attention.
bad,"Management was emotional and overbearing. Learned a lot- they offered many classes to help with the job including different programs and how to move up within the company. Workplace culture was cut throat and abrasive. Hardest part about the job is the stress. The most enjoyable part of the job were the small parties, free things, and the relationships formed with the clients."
bad,"The work load was significantly higher than humanly possible."
bad,"At Field Sales level, intense micro management with greater emphasis placed on check boxing forms than results. $7B US sales and NO CRM for Field Sales. It's all done with a multitude of Excel spread sheets"
bad,"From the beginning, the team was treating me like an unwelcome outsider. I wish that things had been different, but I don't regret not staying. The company has truly a few that may care about employees, but the majority only care about money."
bad,"Grand groupe Internationnal, bonne Anbiance entre collaborateur."
bad,Enjoyed working here and learnin about all of our vendors and lines we sold in the IT industry.
bad,"Low compensation. No room to grow. Very political, shallow culture."
bad,Mise a jour des listes de prix en fonction du cours dollar du jour.

bad,"Cette société a de bonnes bases en therme d’esprit d’équipe, en revanche le salaire et les perspective d’évolution ainsi que le management dans certaines équipes sont à revoir."
bad,"Relaxed work place, good team to work with."
bad,Like a lot of companies the leads have been there running the show as several managers pass through.  Upper management relies on leads to evaluate the manager if leads don't like you they throw you under the bus. Very toxic environment to work in.
bad,"Company without respect to workers, untrusted management."
bad,Tech Data can be a great place to work but the leadership team is young and they don't operate like a team.  The people are hard workers but need leaders to take them to the next level.
bad,"Travail nul, répétitif, pas épanouissant... Certains jours tu aura peu de choses à faire ( un rythme plutôt tranquille, sans se tourner les pouces), d'autre jours, ça sera complètement impossible de sortir le nombre de commandes qu'ils te demanderons de faire, te formeront très mal et s'étonneront que tu fasse mal ton boulot."
bad,"It was a trial going to and from lunch as you had to go through a metal detector both ways and the time was taken off your lunch and break times. So shoes and pockets had to be taken off, turned out and then back on etc."
bad,Our team was told that there was a freeze on hiring new employees and advancement within the company. They said that the freeze would last anywhere from 5 to 10 years.
bad,Etre enfermé dans un entrepôt toute la journée. Etre en contact permanent avec la poussière
bad,Below average management team and extremely micro managed. Too much time and energy focused on all other aspects other than sales. Low moral as well with employees.
bad,"The team I ended on was the worst experience of my career. I gained lots of skills but I struggled with politics. I worked with some great folks and had some good managers, but the last team I was on had poor leadership and no vision or mission. This is a great company to work for. I just had bad luck with assigned leadership."
bad,"High turnover, outdated systems and poor communication.  They make it harder than it needs to be.  If you're not in the ""club"", you're a mushroom.  Too cheap on many levels."
bad,Tech Data  has a unique culture. They are located in a great location if you live close by. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that you work with.
bad,"The teams and connections you make internally and externally at Tech Data are great, I can not stress that enough. However, the consistent lack actual leadership and sticking by their employees by management detracts from what should be a great place to work for. They are far more focused on maintaining their cliques and circles of power to truly let anyone advance within the company. They will tell you in orientation that you are free to advance anywhere in the company, what they do not tell you is how they will randomly put in transfer freezes and restrictions on where you can actually go. For example, if you wish to go from sales to marketing, despite what your position was in sales, you can either go horizontally or downward switching departments."
bad,Avnet just sold us to Tech Data. Too many management layers. Benefits decreased. Used to get to work from home 3 days a week now only one. Over worked and a no overtime policy. Not many paid holidays and paid days off decreased. Long for the old Avnet!
bad,"I was packing so fast the other packers did not have any work to do. They complained to management and I was removed from that area and was told to wrap pallets with plastic by hand when there was a functioning wrapping machine ten feet away. It is sad that my hard work did not pay off and the two-faced, lazy, haters got their way. Management decided to keep the 5 slow, hateful, workers instead of keeping the one hard worker that was actually happy to be there. Don't be surprised when they say you have to work on the weekends because the orders are not getting completed during the week. The reason for that is the lack of work ethic from 90% of the staff. Remember: Being mediocre is the key at this place. Enjoy."
bad,"Leuke collega's globaal gezien"
bad,"The benefits are good - unusal, you don't see these kinds of benefits very many places anymore.  For example, they have a 'family health care day' annually, where they screen for heart disease, diabetes, skin cancer, test eyesight and hearing, body mass index and more, and all employees and their families can get free flu shots."
bad,"Management promotes a work/life balance, room to grow and excel but its longer days with high expectations/quotas and lots of turn over. Senior reps are tasked with an exceeding full work load and responsibilities as well as quota achievement with under industry pay levels."
bad,I will not tell anyone to go there to get a job to much drama. They don't care if you have any family issues it's about the work. Managers in the building have favorites when it comes to certain people.
bad,"Dan posicion de Manager a personas con 0 People Skills, RH te aconseja que si estas perdiendo el tiempo ahi, busques fuera. Totalmente Anti-profesionales."
bad,"I liked my job when I started,was willing to learn and help out when ever needed...came in 1hr early to get my hours to be hired on...then supervisor became shady and back stabbing having me train for their benefit...never holding the right person accountable for their errors...asking me for my opinion and when given,telling other employees I was to opinionated....telling other employees why other employees were let go or fired...bashing them to other employees....they will hire anyone!!!!!...."
bad,Made many good friends.  Learned lots of relevant skills to my field.  In hindsight though I was being taken for granted.  Lots of lost sleep for very little pay.
bad,The pay was undervalued for how much you are working.  The processes for advancement are at a snail's pace.  Constant internal advancement freezes and upper management shuffled paper to make Wall Street love their bottom line.
bad,"A typical day at work-  Most of the time, I have to work long duration hours in order to finish my tasks/orders (generated sales orders from five different countries)."
bad,"Distribution trying to be like a start up. Very behind the times with Leadership Dev, understanding workforce trends and overall employee dev. HR policies are unwritten, made up based on who they like and inconsistent. Chaotic and loud floors with dinosaur mindsets. They speak but do not live their shares values and are so behind the times in understanding what makes employees stay"
bad,Demanding hours. Hard hours. They would allow certain employees to get away with different things such as not following attentants policy dress code ect.  Than other employees would get in trouble for what the other got away with.  I believe in fair treatment of everyone
bad,"This company provided me with a Job...not much opportunity for growth and advancement.  In addition, the organization lacks cultural diversity."

bad,"No people over 55 years working for Dimension"
bad,"With the economy in the toilet Tech Data was continuously fighting for survival, which meant they didn't always do right by their employees."
bad,Very poor management. Aside from that it is a fun place to work. Ending of the month is a killer just like in any sales job. 1 hour lunch break. It is imperative to be on time and no call outs.
good,good place to work.Real nothing to learn.Management keep thing for themself .Co-worker some are very good people some ok.Wake up in the morning around 2:30a.m especial in the winter time .We start around 4 a.m in the morning.
good,"Although attempting to implement Agile/Scrum techniques, Tech data had no strategic plan on what the direction would take. There is also no job security despite no negative reviews."
good,"Duties and responsibilities"
good,"The employees and environment at tech data is relaxed . Employees here are very helpful and friendly. This is a typical nine to 5 corporate job with little advancement.  There was little to no training and unrealistic expectations were held when getting the work done. The management is horrible. The manager is never in office and always hard to reach. I would request a PTO day 2 months in advance and i wouldn't hear back until the day before. The manager would delegate her work last minute onto the team forcing them to stay an extra 2-3 hours to get it done and it had nothing to do with their job role.  Also, the manager had no clue what we actually did on a day to day basis so they were never able to help out. When we had team meetings all we went over was numbers for that quarter and what our next goal was, no real issues were being talked about or how improvements could be made. The management was so minimal that the team would do whatever they wanted, people would just disappear for hours, call in sick all the time, and not work but be paid. No one was held accountable and some were blamed/ disciplined for no reason or evidence to back up the accusations. I would not recommend working here."
good,This company's culture is based on salesmanship. Any prospective employee needs to consider if they are a good salesperson. If a good salesperson then this company is worth considering.
good,"Found management to be unsupported."
good,"trés bonne ambiance de travail,"
good,"Promotes a good social culture, working on own initiative,  develops networking skills. high pressure all about the number, high turnover, opportunity's for personal development."
good,"Tech Data is a fun place to work for as a starting job into the sales market.  There are plenty of ways you can grow in the company, but it seems very behind on the allowance of work/life balance."
good,"Managers not professional , many want to hire people like them.  They mimic a big corporate environment but lack follow through and pay low wages to most minorities unless they know and like you."
good,"Tech Data is a large company that has acquired other companies to build out their Services for IT.  They are now losing money and have to cut overhead, which means people.  I am still employed, but do not expect to last past Feb 2018 when the next fiscal year starts.  I would rather leave on my own terms"
good,"Temporary position to get me into company. Only positions open at the time were on phone sales jobs, but I stuck it out waiting for my IT jobs to become available. I took another IT position elsewhere as this company required too long a waiting period."
good,"Since the day Tech Data purchased Avnet, there were several RIFs. Not a good environment to be productive. Not quite sure how a fortune 80 company needs a RIF multiple times in a year."
good,"Bullpen Work Environment with fear-mongering micromanagement.  Pressure for production is intense. Employees have to stop caring about the quality of work for quantity to appease supervisors. "
good,die Arbeitskultur hat sich aufgrund eines hohen Wechsels im Firmenmanagement in den letzen Jahren verschlechtert.
good,good place to work and has a lot of room for advancement. good place to work for desk job 
good,Overworked and underpaid. Management was very sarcastic and disrespectful.
good,"Long hours / low pay and high expectations.   "
good,Excellent place to start off a sales career.  Help get you started on an great path for sales growth.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to get involved with sales.
good,"I met a lot of life-long friends while working for this organization. "
good,"When I first got to Tech Data it was a great sales environment where everyone seemed to be happy. Over the course of my employment some changes were made to management and it really stunted my career development. I feel like I am trapped in my current role with little hope of being promoted. Managers play favorites with who gets promotions like many jobs do; some employees with weak skill sets often get lucky. Management has little to zero idea the potential and the knowledge of the individuals on the sales floor. It is a fast paced environment and the compensation is not what it should be for the amount of work you put in. Look elsewhere, possibly a competitor may even pay more."
good,Tech Data is like any other sales distribution environment. They do do some things well and others not so well.  If you want to make the move into distribution start here.
good,"As warehouse operative job is good, but the management the run the company is not able to organize the job daily.Everyday there are lot of problems and rarely the job is finished in time."
good,"Did not enjoy working there, but learned a lot of new skills."
good,"Heb er ruim zes jaar met plezier gewerkt alleen het laatste jaar"
good,"Large corporation experience, compensation is less than industry standards, management varies greatly, reactive rather than proactive, meet lots of new people"
good,"Very busy in the summer so you’re working 40-60hrs a week, but they let go of people during the winter when business slows down, management sucks they don’t take advice from employees, they move you around to different departments to pick up slack  if they’re short employees, favoritisms is a big thing here as well"
good,"High cost tech in the warehouse so you won't be able to bring your phone in, which is understandable but still annoying when you need to answer your phone right away. Some days you won't work a full 8 hour day. Some days you have to work 9-12 hour days unexpectedly. Parts of the day are really slow to a fast pace environment. Worked for 4 months then was laid off. Actually pretty happy I don't have to go back."
good,It's hard to list my time at Tech data due to redundancy and at month end working till 10 at night with no extra reward to the manager in place. The work life balance was not great but the people in the team made a great sector to work.
good,If you can handle long hours and never knowing how many hours of overtime you'll work that day until the later part of your shift then this is the job for you. There is no comradery and they look at everyone as expendable so you will not feel welcomed. If you love just working and endless amounts of it as it seems then apply.
good,Employees are very friendly and easy going.  This is a call center type of business with long periods of sitting and taking calls and answering emails.
good,"lots of experience, learned so much about business, but stressful work environment.  Processing orders/quoting prices, answering phones and making out bounds."
good,"Tech Data est au global une bonne entreprise leader sur son marché. "
good,enjoyable company and used to be a lot more giving to its employees.  a lot of the attraction to tech data is far gone due to management taking things in a direction that took a lot of the extra compensation and incentives away while forcing people to work harder for barely making the bare minimum of your salary
good,"Tech Data is for the young / out of college person , who is looking to move up in a sales postion"
good,Starkt företag med bra kompetent personal. Intressanta kunder och möjlighet till utveckling.
good,"Employees are careless and only care about themselves. Management is good, just a little political. "
good,"Es una empresa del sector IT que todavía está en estado de desarrollo. La misma va creciendo y sus stocks suben, además va adqueriendo otras gradnes empresas recientemente. Se focaliza en Software y servicios cloud. "
good,"they let people go when they were sick "
good,"You meet interesting people , there are a lot issues that are blame on sales, even though that there customer care team suppose to handle"
good,"Constant micromanagement by upper management. Slightest mistake and one may get written up by management. Low pay. Inadequate staff, making it harder on the employees in my department."
good,"Terrible culture, no compensation for anyone but sales staff. Absolutely the antithesis of what the tech industry is suppose to be. Avoid this employer unless this is simply a short stepping stone for you."
good,"Avnet was truly dedicated to the employee's work life balance, Tech Data truly did not know what work life balance even represented.  Once Tech Data took over wave after wave of layoffs began with entire work campuses shut down.  The sad end of a caring corporate entity (Avnet) ceased to exist."
good,"The entire point of working at Tech Data is to get experience with a Big Name tech distribution company. Everyone here basically tries to get as high up as they can get, and ultimately leaves to join a Vendor organization (HP, Dell, Lenovo, etc.) or becomes complacent and stays in the same position for decades on end."
good,"Awesome company, great manager I have.  work for both fontana and Bloomington Locations, workload is really easy, nothing to heavy for anyone to do, I love the safety precautions they take. The one part and only worse part is that they have very poor attendance policies, they have zero tolerance for human error, they wanna make everything your fault for every inccident that happens, very cowardly from people calling themselves leaders,  they loose great people due to minor inccidents, but like every company I've been in, they only care about their profits.  Finally VERY VERY VERY LOW CHANCE FOR ADVANCEMENT,  planning to stay here for a year, theres bigger things to chase, go to school people or chase a dream, working at a warehouse for many years could be a pain in the butt."
good,Tech Data job environment is great to work in. There is many job function that management give to the employers. No structured training and the pay is low.
good,Starting off here was a great introduction to establishing a corporate career. The pay was peanuts when compared to the volume of work that was performed but many valuable skills were learned.
good,Good to learn about computer parts. This isnt the place for advancement. Workers informed me they been doing the samething for 20years and hate it. Sometimes they hire temp to hire but they will try to keep you as a temp to pay you little to nothing. Saw a guy there working as a temp for 4 years.
good,"Leading IT Distributor with Global foot print - Great place to work, supportive  peers and  great place to begin your career in Distribution business."
good,"Though the work is very fast-paced, the marketing team worked together to brainstorm and create amazing marketing materials. Worked evenings and weekends for big event preparation, but the team pulled together."
good,"This is an excellent job opportunity for college students but not for people with a family. Little to no pay increases and bonuses have been removed. Not much incentive to work for the Swedesboro, NJ location."
good,Mostly slow paced. Promotions seemed to be based off of seniority and friendship rather than work ethic. Spent a lot of time training in different departments only to be denied a promotion to somebody who had been there longer. Was asked to help train the person who got the promotion.
good,"Well to start tech data is not bad place to work. It's a really fast pace environment, but at times can be very unprofessional, by losing PTO papers and having poor management."
good,"Der Arbeitstag verläuft immer unterschiedlich, je nachdem was gerade anfällt. Man ist  als Business Manager in einer Schnittstellenposition und hat daher ein sehr breites Aufgabenspektrum."
good,"Several years ago, Tech Data was a great place to work and the Sales Department was fun and worth it.  In the last few years they have developed new training programs and sales ops managers that have separated support roles from sales rep positions and it has been an utter failure.  The Sr. Sales Ops manager is horrible at managing people and doesn't understand that not all customers needs are identical.  Most of the people at work are very sociable and easy to get along with.  There used to be a lot of opportunity for growth but it seems to be harder and harder to find opportunities within the company."
good,Management is good and give employees plenty of room to shine however it can be difficult to make obtain large promotions and a typical promotion is a very small pay bump. Great company to start out at or build a resume at.
good,"j'ai aimé dans le cadre de matériels de travail ."
good,"My co-workers are great to work with.  A typical day at work is very fast paced, constant meetings and very administrative."
good,Working in the marketing department was not very demanding and there was little oversight. The pay was not great and there was a lot of turnover. It would be a good place to start a career and gain some tech experience before moving on to a place that's better managed.
good,"Scope of responsibilities:"
good,"Les journées sont chargées, le travail est complet et ne manque pas. les interactions avec les autres services sont nombreux et enrichissants."
good,"Environnement agréable avec les collaborateurs."
good,"Boa cultura empresarial"
good,"The company was completely different from what I was sold.  There was a lot of high school style 'he said, she said', which resulted in a very split leadership organization.  60 hour work weeks were normal and you were looked down upon if you did not hit that number.  The work was not challenging and fairly boring."
good,"Préparation de commandes , à la chaines "
good,I learned that you should keep to your self in a corporate type setting.
good,"The work itself is good. However, supervisors have been witnessed gleefully ignoring policies and procedures. These same supervisors have the audacity to reprimand others for the same violations. These supervisors have reprimanded individuals for not following instructions that weren't given. "
good,Freie Entfaltung möglich; sehr viele Möglichkeiten sich weiterzubilden.
good,Overall Tech Data Corp is a good company to work for however its not easy to get promoted within your Dept or to even move into another Dept and the health care costs have gone up a lot
good,Tech Data has a typical medium size IT department that has limited amount of growth available for growth. Corporate culture is fairly laid back and co-workers are helpful.
good,"Very relaxed company culture as long as you get your work done. A lot of variety in style depending on which department you go in. "
good,"The job itself and the company are great. However, management is substandard. Some would be grateful for the mandatory overtime, as was I, in the beginning. But after 3 months of no days off, having to use sick time and vacation time to take a day off (not without repercussions), it gets really old.. Really fast.. The worst thing about this company is the lack of a grace period upon start time.  With as many as 200 employees scheduled for the same shift, there should be more than just a 3 minute prior to start grace period. If the camera shows you standing at or in line for the time clock at your given start time.. Give them the darn time. You lose good people when you have stupid policies."
good,"Hire young talent, when you expand career, they replace eventually to avoid high paid salaries. Very competitive by having different employees work on same projects!"
good,Tech Data is a very productive work environment but the management is very poor. the supervisor does not take his job seriously. this job is very easy to excel at
good,Leader in IT distribution. Great company to learn the business of IT and the distribution channel. Great opportunities to network with vendors representatives and IT resellers. Very face paced industry with constant change and innovation.
good,Definitely needs to work on being Climate controlled but a pretty good place to work over all. They have good overtime available also so that's good.
good,"All overtime is mandatory on a day to day basic. You do not know how long you will have to work that day until you are already at work half way through your shift."
good,"Tech Data is a good company to start a career, it will allow you to growth professionally and gain experience. The company it is not good paying their employees. Good atmosphere, professional environment."
good,"This is a good place to start. There is not a whole lot of training or guidance so it may be difficult for people that are accustomed to training. There are a lot of work challenges that can be good for experiences. As with any corporation, there are organizational challenges that can sap your energy."
good,Really not much to say was a fast paced job getting orders in and out management was fine i liked it because it because when its alot of orders gets the day going by faster bad art is when theres nothing to do its nothing to do
good,I like it.  It's a good place to work.  I've learned a lot and have received a few certifications.  The culture is great for the most part.  Everyone gets a fair chance.
good,"Fair pay, good collaboration. Always something different to do. "
good,"Work culture determined by employee. Remote work done most at home."
good,"Located in Clearwater, FL, Tech Data has a staff of committed individuals, dedicated to their work and the company. The office environment is exceptional,"
good,"Práce u které se člověk tolik nenadře, dobrý kolektiv"
good,"Tech Data is a great company to have on your resume and to gain experience in IT distribution. That said, the pay is terrible, culture is declining, promotions are slow, leadership mediocre at best. Benefits are good and they are a diverse employer. Ethically speaking, Tech Data does actually do a good job as an EEO and offering a good work/life balance. They will not tell you that they are giving you six weeks paid leave per year and then renege. The organization does expect you to utilize those benefits and not ""burn yourself out."" All things considered, however, the pay is an almost unlivable wage and the company now has a massive attrition problem. It's a shame, because in October of 2014 when I had started there, I would have told you it was the best company in the world to work for."
good,You have to be on-call for a week sometime and you won't get paid for that. The team was great but the work culture was not the best. The release and deployment process was really painful due has to be done after hours.
good,Buenos supervisores pero los trabajadores generales son muy toxicos.
good,"Tech Data has complete product lines in software, networking and communications, mass storage, peripherals and computer systems. In addition to distributing more than 75,000 products from over 1000 manufacturers and publishers, Tech Data provides extensive pre-sale and post-sale training, service and support."
good,Really poor management lots of unorganized stuff people just doing whatever they want all in all within my time working there it seemed like a complete mess.
good,"Tech Data's IT department is one that accomplishes great things despite great growing pains. The team works well together, is very hard working, and gets a lot done in the face an overwhelming work load."
good,The people there are really great and I enjoyed working with them.  The campus was a little out dated.  Opportunity to work with different groups and vendors.
good,"I could be a fun place to work but the turn over is incredibly high, management had a serious attitude problem and was highly inappropriate and the job I was actually hired to do fell through."
good,"Being a lead tech I come in and insure that techs were working the correct day to day products to meet Service reliability and ship times.  Troubleshoot and resolve or escalate issues to proper department for resolution and possibly move ship dates if issues were not resolved same day they shipped.  Work culture was laid back for those that chose not work and there was those of us that worked hard to make goals for the team and the company.  The hard part was carrying the wait of those that didn't care causing late nights and sometimes weekends for those of us that cared it was always the same people that stayed late or come in on weekends.  My most enjoyable part was my team!  They were reliable, accountable, very professional, and I miss them.  I do stay in contact with my old team today they were all great and wish them the best of luck hanging there."
good,"Tech Data is definitely a good place to start your career.  There are many opportunities available that can lead to more strategic positions down the road, but not necessarily within the company  You will definitely have the opportunity to learn new processes, systems, and other skill sets.  However, Tech Data can be stagnant in regards to ""moving up.""  Oftentimes, those with the best skills will leave for other companies as there are only lateral moves available and Tech Data is hard pressed to retain that talent.  Workplace culture has definitely changed over the years, which leads to direct feedback on the best and worst parts of the job.  You will enjoy working with the people as the team bonding and camaraderie are top level.  However, you will need this bond as the worst part is the work life balance and micromanaging that you will experience.  Expect to work beyond your standard 40 hour week with some micromanaging thrown in.  Management styles at the company vary so your experience will not be consistent."
good,Tech Data Corp is a good place where you can learn alot but the pay can be low in certain depts and it can be somewhat difficult to move around the company
good,"I have been here for a year and a half and it has been a brilliant workplace. The team are really friendly and the managers are very supportive, overall the company is very successful."
good,"Jag har jobbat inom byggbranschen, äldreboende, McDonalds samt lagerarbetet jag jobbar med nu. Jag tog studenten det här året, 2018, i juni. Direkt efter studenten så blev jag antagen för värnplikt och gjorde militärtjänsten en månad senare."
good,no day was a normal day.  the variation of the work from day to day was good.  it was extremely friendly.  very social culture with lots of activities which is for all employees
good,Great place to work. Very friendly people. I learned a lot to do with Cisco Technologies. I also really enjoyed my management team. They were not shy on sending you around the country to learn new technologies.
good,TechData is a great place to work. you can choose your own work hours and they help you with any outside difficulties you might have. it is overall a good company to work for.
good,"There is a lot of focus on growth of the company, but not so much in the growth of its employees.  The people you work with on a day to day basis are the reason why you go to work."
good,"Tech Data continues to exist primarily as a logistics provider of technology to small and medium business that would not normally be serviced by the vendors."
good,"Nice job , friendly people everyone always helping one another out if needed. A lot of overtime everyday just about , managers try to work with you on schedule times."
good,".....not a bad place to work. Management ok , but no training offered. Like the cafeteria. dont like people talking behind your back. work a little more than what you get paid"
good,"A typical day at work was get in around 8:30AM, run my daily, weekly or monthly reports, complete projects assigned or analysis. My day would typically end when the job was completed."
good,C'est une entreprise jeune et dynamique avec une équipe de toutes les nationalités.
good,I liked my coworkers but the compensation was in no way aligned with the responsibility and profitability the position carried. Good intro into IT distribution.
good,"You need to know someone to be successful. Managers are okay, but make sure you are on there good side. Free food/prizes are mask to the low pay you will receive."
good,Learned a great deal during my work experience with the organization.  Was fortunate to work at the offshore locations in the development phase of the department.
good,Heb met veel plezier gewerkt bij tech data. Heel veel geleerd.  Maar toe aan een nieuwe uitdaging.
good,"As a senior manager I had big responsibilities."
good,"Its a decent job, nice pay. Needs management updates.I found it to be a great environment for people looking for temporary employment. I do not care for this company"
good,preparazione ordini carico e scarico con utilizzo dei muletti
good,Es una gran empresa en la que puedes aprender mucho.
good,"Centralizacion de servicios europeos en Barcelona."
good,You might as well get a salaried position at Tech Data because you will be working through your breaks and lunches anyway. Poor management. Good benefits.
good,"Excellent hours and good benefits. Enjoy working with coworkers. Friendly environment, and flexible with work schedule. Managers are understanding when need to take time off."
good,"Very ordinary, busy environment and good experience for me. I spent at least three months and had at least corporation experiences. But do not want to work again."
good,"A true multinational organisation, with employees from 27 different countries. Here I learnt to manage a great deal of diverse backgrounds and work in a coherent and productive manner."
good,had long hours but those are gone and only working 8-9 hours. Management needs better understanding of anticipating change and giving close attention to priorities and details. Overall normal work place
good,"pro mne nevyhovujuci celodenny smeny,fyzicky náročná práce"
good,I was an SSR so i do not have much to say but according to my coworkers at the time there was a lot of unprofessional decisions made.
good,"Working in international environment, providing constant user support and developing new applications. Great manager, self planned day schedule full of responsibilities."
good,"dagindeling - telefoon beantwoorden, opvolging reservaties ,  opvolging binnenkomst goederen, het toekennen van deze goederen aan de klanten, "
good,"Employed there for 18 years, started off working 12-9 but now my schedule fluctuates from 8-5 & 9-6. "
good,"Typical day, I make outbound sales calls, I initiate meetings internally and externally.  I plan strategic events for customers in order to drive revenue."
good,tres grosse boite avec une qualite de travail  a l 'americaine ou tout le monde sait ce qui la à faire
good,"Suite au rachat de Best'ware par TechData, nous devons donner le meilleur de nous même."
good,"Anybody who doesn't have ambition and values security over all other needs should work there. "
good,Co workers and management are great in this company. Family values and worker safety rate high in this company. Time management and accuracy are skills you would learn here.
good,everything sucks here management and all stay away. Pay was horrible benefits horrible except vacation time was good. Coworkers some ok others would stab you in the back in a heart beat
good,The firm is a Fortune 500 company and looks good on your resume. They offer a pleasant campus environment and a laid back atmosphere. All things considered I enjoyed my time there.
good,"Marketing Program Manager – Software DivisionVendor Accounts 9/96-1/98 Special Initiatives 1/98-10/98 Sell programs to software manufacturers. Drove strategic initiatives to introduce new software focus including a licensing program, reseller education, electronic software distribution, and other campaigns integrating Internet focused program that immediately generated a 30% return to the bottom line while software sales increased a minimum of 10%. Generated over $1 billion in corporate revenue through vendor supported campaigns and programs. Created marketing campaigns to drive manufacturer sales through channel distribution. Produced in excess of $3.5 million annually with over 100 accounts. Realized an increase in corporate and manufacturer revenue over 300% in new reseller business with a marketing plan that included electronic and print media, technical sales training and telemarketing."
good,"They have recently implemented a system called occurrences for being tardy (1 minute or more late). If you receive 8 whole occurrences you are terminated, no ""if's"" ""and's"" or ""butt's"". Even if you are at your desk at 8:59am and you clock in at 9:01am, you get an occurrence. It's an extremely stressful environment and turn over is very high for new hires (about 50% leave within 90 days)."
good,"This is all my opinion,and over all it's not that bad compared to other warehouses .But will say this Depending on what department you are in, you will be asked to support your department and the other as well . Mandatory overtime at the end of the month every month.  Not often but you might have to work weekends as well.. Their is room for advancement such as management positions, however,  since it is  internalized it often goes to Associates with seniority, as in any other Warehouse setting.  rather than those who are qualified. Thing seemed to be getting better as I was leaving,  their  always room for improvement,  yet management needs to be trained better my personal opinion.  For example in empathy and time management issues,  as well as leave personal biases or issues when making decisions.  The work isn't overwhelming and will always train you beforehand  ,whether it's learning to use the equipment or scanners the standards[rules ].  You are on production  but as long as you're on task it is not really a issue.  Over all its meh."
good,"Nerf dart wars between placing quotes and orders make it seem like a fun environment to work at, and while some might have time to play around and twirl their thumbs, other teams are drowning in work, with unevenly distributed work loads with a due date and heavily pushed SLA times and pressure to make no mistakes. Multiple trainings with exams and test scores are required and monitored by not just managers, but shared with other employees. and god forbid you get on the bad side of the trainers, because then test scores wont matter as much and micro managing you and trying to find mistakes where non were made."
good,Typical work day was about 10 to 12 hours. Learned how to use all types of equipment including fork lifts and such. Management is decently fair and will to work with you. Diverse culture but mostly pleasant. Hardest part of the job was the long hours and lack of sleep due to long hours. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people I met and worked with.
good,It was great job just long hours most days. Easy work just had to be detailed oriented. I learned to work consistently to not get backed up because there where on most days one person per work area because they where kind of short on workers. management was ok didn't help out much just gave orders
good,"The one thing that stands out to me is the ability to learn as much as you want too with this company.  Strong leadership, decent people to work with."
good,"Société avec une très bonne ambiance .. "
good,"I personally would recommend Tech Data to anyone who is looking for a career in computers/computing. It is very cut-throat, though. I would not personally recommend it to any of my friends as I know that none of them are into computer selling. Tech Data does offer a very good 410(k)."
good,The company is fine to work for.  Corporate atmosphere.  You meet people from various backgrounds.  Able to make some lasting relationships.  You can establish good relationships with vendors.
good,"Management issues some are great if your lucky enough to land on the right team."
good,"Enjoy my team but don't feel rewarded at all for the hard work and long hours. Starting to emerge from old corporate mentality into current market standards, slight improvement to work/life balance but still a long way to go."
good,You definitely do not get paid what you are worth. Not a lot of job opportunities to grow with the company. You have to pay a lot out of pocket for benefits.
good,"Management is solid, it can be stressful at times, hardest part of my job is the workload. The team I happen to be on is what keeps me going on a daily basis."
good,"A typical day was trying not to get wrote up for something silly. you always have good managers, and managers that suck at there job, but you balance it out."
good,Upper management didn't communicate well with the sales and marketing teams. They would tell sales different things than the marketing team. They ignored the contracts we had with resellers and vendors.
good,"I enjoyed everything about Tech Data, except after poor quarterly sales, ""position elimination"" would occur.  I would encourage people to work there but don't necessarily expect job security."
good,This company is openly moving all positions to a country which pays lower wages. No focus at all on keeping staff happy.
good,"Great manager, no real opportunity for advancement, Okay health benefits, okay pay rate, no real raise unfortunately"
good,"Need to look at mid level managers and see how supportive or not, they are to the employee.  Constantly changing the focus in the company."
good,"Pas assez d'évolution, rythme intense pour une rémunération faible."
good,"druk gezellig werk, contact met klanten was heel goed. begrip tonen voor eenmanszaken. bij grote klanten doortasten optreden."
good,The environment was very productive and goal oriented. There was overtime readily availible.
good,"cadence logistique très soutenue ( certains jours 1000 expés ou plus )"
good,"Buena empresa, el ambiente de trabajo es relax, Home Office un plus, pero dificilmente hay crecimiento y como varias empresas hay favoritismo."
good,Het is een groot Amerikaans bedrijf met een sterke dominante cultuur. Doorgroeien bestaat zeker tot de mogelijkheden als je opvalt. Dit is een goede tussenstap in je carrière.
good,"Heel wat bijgeleerd ivm gebruik van Excell -  kreeg er een heel goeie opleiding van een collega,  waarmee ik een perfecte band had."
good,"help you in any possiable but does not have air. An ok place to work but not long term even though some emolyees have been there for 20 years, Not to bad of a place"
good,"Se cumplen con los procesos establecidos"
good,"Fortune company with a traditional culture.  You get to work with other big name companies and software, which provides great learning opportunities.  People are caring and helpful, specially since the hours can be long.  After you've proven to be a good employee you get to work from home one to two days a week, although the culture of the company is not positive when it comes to remote working, and it can be viewed as slacking off.  The technology provided feels old and cheap, making it difficult to do your job.  Depending on the department you work in, be prepare to work very long hours, and to get something done you have to go through a lot of red tape."
good,"The company is set up to provide thousands of customers with excellent customer service, and provide IT equipment across all technology sets with ease. The people I worked with are great and are always looking to better themselves. I only feel that the organisation could/needs to do more to provide the same level of service to the enterprise IT industry. I feel this is the area which lets the organisation down, and if effectively keeping their competition in business.The current set up o this side of the business quite often prevents you from being able to offer the level of service you want and the customer expects, so can create issues for both parties."
good,"Tech Data has a lot to offer, but the burnout rate is high. It's an extremely high pressure job. The people are pretty great to work with, however management does play favoritism as with any company. There are a lot of perks and opportunities for advancement in the IT field."
good,I have just started at Tech data it's place that gave me an opportinuty as an entry level technician with an A.A.S in electrical Engineering. I have learned no many new skills
good,"this is the same as the DCR , it is the same company."
good,Tech Data is a great place to get you foot in the door. the pay is decent for entry level but doesn't get much better. they promote from within a lot but you can get stuck after unless you move to a different department.
good,"picking, packing, & shipping are all involded at this job. tons of overtime and plenty of people to help you if your lost,very nice benifits. would work there agin."
good,"Interesting and diverse workplace. Large company with many opportunities for advancement, training, and growth. Always lots of work and special projects going on, and their face to the community is incredible. They actively encourage participation in community volunteerism and provide many opportunities in this area both inside and outside the company.  The company recently has acquired another company of the same size with a larger global presence, and the integration of the two companies is now the primary focus. I have worked at Tech Data for 10 years and have seen many people come and go and a lot of cultural change -- for the better! Management is top-notch and the work culture is very inclusive. The hardest part of the job is the lack of up-to-date technology for some departments. Makes the work more difficult to reach productivity goals."
good,great work experience other than not having enough workers to maintain work/life balance.  Great coworker relationships.  hardest part of job was the extreme heat conditions.
good,"Hay bastantes externos que han trabajado aquí y han pedido cambio de cliente por el ritmo de trabajo en TD. Se trabaja mucho y se aprende más. El ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno, mucha cercanía con gerencia, cosa que en otra empresa lo veo complicado."
good,Tech Data is a great company to work for and I have always had great management while at the company. There is plenty of room for advancement if you work for it.
good,"Uma empresa no ramo de distribuicao de tecnologia, ou seja um ritmo muito intenso para se trabalhar"
good,Fast paced environment with a diverse community. The work environment is always moving fast and definitely under pressure.
good,"My time at Tech Data was some what enjoyable as the culture and the coworkers i had were very positive . "
good,"A typical day at work required up to 12 hours of work. It was a warehouse environment so it was sometimes hot and muggy, and noisy. It was fast-paced and you had to meet the daily numbers to have a job, but the expectations were well explained in advance, and you were rewarded very well for meeting them."
good,I'm stuck on a team with awful leadership. This is a rarity at Tech Data. Working to change teams. Make sure you ask a lot of questions about leadership style in your interview.
good,"break down skids"
good,Its a good company to work for with a good working environment. Sales gets hit from every angle and sometimes does not get the help that it needs from other departments. Pay was ok when you are hitting your bonus. The benefits were normal and you get a week of vacation to start followed by two after your first year. Sales does get a lot of perks and free stuff from the vendors. The managers that I had were all good and very helpful.
good,"A lot of visibility if you work hard. Plenty of opportunity for advancement, but also political. I have never had a problem taking off work when needed, but you are also expected to work long hours."
good,"good systems, good customer service, good leadership team"
good,"good place to work, a good opportunity to learn new things and the chance to meet people from all over the world, the salary was not amazing but you get other benefits"
good,It is a tiring job and can ware your body into different stages of exhaustion. I myself have been working 12 hours consistently everyday on a regular basis. Their were two weeks where i worked 16 hours everyday and it was impossible to to not function right at work although i still brought my effort and performed 100% i was still able to work safely and be productive.
good,"nice company to work for if you're into the whole scientology thing since Clearwater, FLA is the scientology capital of the USA.  has a weird vibe in the office for sure, very cult like.  I was living in Sacramento, California which is completely different than Clearwater, Fla.  nice company and good people though"
good,I picked my own items to fulfill customer orders with a forklift or by hand depending on the weight and location of the item.I learned to drive an electric pallet jack. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the temperature. It was cold in the winter and hot in the summer.
good,"Popularity contest and very biased management. I did fairly well in this job, but I am also very enthusiastic and outspoken."
good,"Travail assez instructif au niveau de la gestion des relations clients puisque ce sont uniquement des clients revendeurs. "
good,Upper management assumed they knew better than their direct reports and it caused unneeded drama. If they truly valued their employees they would listen to what their employees had to say and suggestions.
good,"Ok at first, then everything went downhill. It just became a terrible work environment. There were a few who did our own work, then did others work, because those others did not tend to do their own work. Some regularly did not come to work."
good,"Fast paced environment, made fun by activities and competitions. Management supportive and approachable."
good,"High paced work environment. Stressful."
good,"Bedrijf met veel mogelijkheden."
good,"Very productive and friendly.  Great opportunities with tuition reimbursement, paternal child leave, refer hiring bonus,  etc Awesome friends and colleagues encouraging teamwork. Cool volunteer opportunities to go to places you've been before to help feed the homeless,  walk for a cause, or bowl for your job and represent it with professional fun!"
good,"I was there for almost ten years and had four job titles in two different  departments. Being a big company there's room to move around and try new things. I learned a lot about the wholesale business, in house marketing planning and administration, logistics and inventory management."
good,"Good team environment. I had a wide range of official and unofficial responsibilities. Because the pre-sales support role was relatively new when I started, it was constantly evolving. I was able to help to define the role. At times, the division of labour was unclear, between sales, product management and finance. The presales role touched all of these areas. However, overall it was a good experience."
good,"Tech Data is a great company to work for. It is a fun and semi-fast paced environment. However, there is little place to grow and management is lacking management skills, oddly enough. The culture in the company is great and everyone is very friendly. The hardest part of the job is not knowing what is to come. The most enjoyable part of the job is being involved in various events while working closely with vendors."
good,"looking to progress, redundancy happening in Finance. overall good time at Tech Data but no room to grow and now job's at risk"
good,"Contacts clientèle pas mail et téléphones"
good,"Tech Data is a great place to start out, lots of experienced people and a great deal to learn, it provides good foundations for a career path in Logistics."
good,"The offices in Barcelona are very nice and the location is well connected."
good,Great company to gain sales experience out of college. Training and incentives was my favorite part about working there. Learned a lot about technologies and different product lines as well.
good,"Excelente ambiente laboral, Mi manager en lo personal es una buena persona y entiende cada uno de los conflictos que pueden existir dentro y fuera de esta empresa."
good,"I got this job through a temp agency, but was referred by an employee at the time. Pay was ok, i didn't receive benefits until hired on through the company after 6 months. The work environment was very strict on taking breaks and lunch at specific times and the work floor was very quiet."
good,"Opportunity for professional development, collaborate with international cross-functional teams in a fast paced environment. Diverse and socially aware workforce."
good,I thought it was a good job the only problem I had was I got in trouble because I changed someone else's battery and they forgot to put there battery gate on but over all I liked working there
good,If you are willing to never see your family go and apply. Eventually you will work 12+ hours. Overtime is mandatory but they have great benefits. The pay is okay.
good,"Commerce de gros d’ordinateurs, d’équipements informatiques périphériques et de logiciels."
good,Tech Data is a great place to start your career. They offer training programs that makes it easy for new employees to transition into the company. Overall a good place to work.
good,"Back in 2007 this was an incredibly young, fast paced distribution company.  Many great people had worked and were working here.  Thoroughly recommended as a start to your working life."
good,Tech Data is a great place to start your career.  They offer training programs that makes it easy for new employees to transition into the company.  Overall a good place to work.
good,Multinacional donde te mueves en un ambiente multicultural
good,"I worked for Tech Data for 3 years, in two departments, in two roles due to promotion after 18 month transfer policy hold. There is no work/life balance since 36 billion dollar company with fresh 2.6 billion dollar acquisition where revenue was still lost. Over 60 people laid off on quarterly basis to help workforce budget. Management is disorganized since executive leadership is a revolving door and doesn't give reasonable, realist direction (abrupt non-strategic changes last minutes and metrics affected). Loss of multimillion dollar business with vendor partners and major authorized resellers. Many fun events thrown for sales only to mask employees being overworked and underpaid."
good,"Tech data has its moments where the work can be hard and long but the pay is good."
good,Real good place to work . Only thing is you know when your goin in to work you just never know when your getting out .managers and staff are really good people to be around . Just dint like last minute overtime when I was ending my shift in 15 minutes .
good,"Good corporation, limited advancements. Merger of two companies, with evolving methodologies.  New CEO, as a result of merger, several executives are leaving company."
good,No veo prioridad en America Latina para Tech Data.  Buena empresa pero veniamos de una mejor como lo fue Avnet Tchnology Solutions
good,"Entreprise correcte, l'évolution professionnelle est possible."
good,"Zeer vriendelijke mensen, aangenaam om elke dag te gaan en zeer mooie uren."
good,"Un trabajo donde aprendí a trabajar de cara al público, atendiendo tanto a clientes, como a mensajeros, a personas que venían a hacer entrevistas, etc...."
good,"A good company to work for and brings lots of opportunity and can be fun. But it can be stressful and they are always looking to reduce costs - costs=people, so your job is NEVER secure"
good,"Make sure that if you have in accident or issue, follow up and tell someone or you will be terminated. Other then that, make sure to work accordingly to the schedule and try to stay as long as they need you too."
good,great job to work for. only issue i had was they would throw overtime on us with little to no notice. you would start at 9am and wouldn't find out when you were getting off until after lunch at the meeting..
good,I really enjoyed working for tech data. I gained a lot of valuable experience. Would love to work for them again. They have a lot of great managers but it is always changing.
good,A great place to work if you find the right department and team to be with. My department was very goal driven but always awarded hard with when they could.
good,"Overall, Tech Data is a good company. However, if you end up in the wrong department it can become a dead end job. It is all about who you know in this place"
good,"I learned to be a team player, in a fast-paced environment. Picking, packing, shipping, receiving, driving the forklift, and pallet-jack were among some the areas that I've grown while being here."
good,"They ask a lot out of their employees yet the pay doesn't reflect the work. Distribution requires and expects long hours and being on call nights/weekends/etc, however, if you are salary, you don't get paid for that time or recognized for it. The work life balance is really tough when you deal with demanding schedules and vendors. It is known they don't pay high and therefore have a tremendous amount of turnover. However, the people there make going to work fun. They make dealing with the stresses of day to day tasks seem not so daunting. It is the people there, that keep most employees coming back each day."
good,"I believe Tech Data to be a good company to work for. It provides a good balance between a fun and professional workplace."
good,"Uma grande escola. Aprendi muito! "
good,"Generally a good place to work  with good benefits. A typical day is 10 to 12 hours mandatory depending on volume of orders. There is a high turnover of employees and management and change is a constant factor. The hardest part of the job is the long hours, lots of lifting, very physical."
good,"During my 9 years at Tech Data, I must say, that it was an extremely rewarding experience. I liked the variation in the job requirements. I was able to demonstrate different skills and had lots of opportunities to use my creative abilities."
good,"Since employed at Tech Data I have had many opportunities to evolve. I have learned different department job functions, cross trained and taken soft skills trainings to improve. All in all Tech Data has my best interest at hand to develop."
good,"Fun place to work, excellent compensation. A lot of nice people work there.  Good long term career opportunity."
good,Tech Data provided a fun way to learn about the corporate world.
good,"I was only an intern for about 3 months, but everyone I worked with was kind and willing to help."
good,"Send/Rec emails, troubleshooting operational concerns, work and interact with front line staff, working with receiving and inventory departments, maintaining facility, ordering supplies for operation and facility, work with carriers companies to ensure SLA timelines are on schedule, all closing procedures i.e bay doors locked, all operational equipment off and back to respective staging area, set alarm. Call service contractors to service equipment and machines, work with Sales Team to ensure End User expectations, service Customer Pick Up Counter"
good,"It was a fine experience to work at tech data. I learned to communicate with the customers smartly and confidently. My work was mainly to sell my company's goods and services.My co-workers were all very helpful and cooperative and inspiring also.Since I entered there as a fresher, they have helped me a lot to learn the strategies"
good,"This facility was top notch. Very neat warehouse that had a full cafeteria in the break room. This job was not difficult at all, the warehouse was new layed out with all the necessary tools to make it a great place to work."
good,É bom para aprender e ganhar experiência no setor da distribuição e networking com os fabricantes.
good,"fun place work, many integration challenges-company needs to train managers in professioal sales training through validated certification programs, but overall the company is good place to work"
good,"Tech Data is great to work for entry level job seekers. You learn a lot about sales, customer service, system processes and collaboration. it provides you with the tools you need to grow as a salesperson, but does not provide advancement opportunities with a pay structure in proportion for that knowledge. In turn, you end up being underpaid for the amount and type of work you're doing, and recieve close to entry level pay even if you advance into a sales rep or ASR II position."
good,"Good entry level job. "
good,Getting check run ready was the first thing that I had to do in the morning.  Then I would review employee expense reports and get them entered in SAP.
good,"The company is major player in the technology distribution channel and has a global reach. Fast-paced work environment, always new things coming in, especially in the IT department. People are friendly and workplace demeanor is relaxed. The company does take the time to train new people that come into the Operations room since there is so much that goes on that cannot be learned anywhere else. Communication between departments in IT is limited and often people want to play the blame game rather than take responsibility for things that go wrong. Advancement opportunities are limited and stress levels can be high when staffing levels are not as they should be in certain departments. Systems monitoring is the easiest part of the job. Dealing with outages is usually the most difficult part when support must be engaged to assist with the issue."
good,no room for advancement not a relaxed atmosphere did not enjoy working there it appeared there where way to many cliques involved losing all or most of your break going through security
good,I enjoyed working here but your 8hr shift is not what u will really do. You actually work 10+hrs and u are not told this until after you start. I worked there for over a year but I had no time with my children and wife so I started searching for something else and found a job with day hours and a $3 increase in pay so I left.
good,I was a switchboard operator and handled all kinds of calls including the foreign language calls. Its a cubicle setting in a big office building. I was able to get training and certifications that helped with my position.
good,"A very good organisation for learning value proposition based selling."
good,"Work time is dependent on how much work there is to be done.  Work days can range from the standard 8 hour day, to 12 hour long days.  Consequently, if there is not sufficient work, unpaid days off are offered.  If there is a significant lack of work, multiple unpaid days off each week can happen."
good,"Worked here for a few months full time as a temp before I decided to pursue another major in school. Everyone was nice, manager was understanding as I had personal issues going on at the time as well."
good,A good place to get experience in the I.T. field. One of the better placed in T.B. to work. Good benefits. Get needed experience and expand work qualifications.
good,Great place to start. There is lots of perks at this job. You must know your stuff and be good at it. Management was good and bad. And there is lots of changes happening all the time. The best place in my opinion in this department is in the sales department.
good,I enjoyed my 6 years at TD. I had planned to retire from that company.  It was never boring. I learned a lot there.  I enjoyed planning activities for my co-workers and really liked my bosses.
good,"Se trabaja bajo mucha presión, lo cual trae beneficios de aprendizaje. Oportunidad de desarrollo profesional."
good,Good company to get your foot into the IT industry with. Advancement becomes a little hard after you have moved up a couple ranks.
good,"Empresa con crecimiento limitado, estabilidad laboral y muy pocos beneficios a los trabajadores."
good,Tex Data is playing catch-up when it comes to some of the policies that Tech Companies have implemented to improve the well-being of employees. Most sales roles are designed to keep the employee tied to a desk with extremely limited flexibility.
good,Quarter-end and year end gets a little hectic but otherwise relaxed work environment. Lots of free goodies from vendors and occasional free lunches during vendor presentations.
good,"Good benefits and incentives. "
good,"Very good company, good scheduling, flexible hours, cafeteria service. Good benefits on the healthcare. Overall very nice company and small so it becomes familiar."
good,"Tech Data has a strong culture, fun place to work. It is easy to get stuck in one department, not many places to go besides sales and product marketing."
good,Great place to work however TD does NOT pay their sales reps well.  They need to get with the times and understand that top sales reps should be able to earn more than minimum wage.
good,Conoci a excelentes personas como compañeros de trabajo donde se pudo trabajar de manera cordial y se vivia un ambiente sano laboral .
good,"An very very multi cultural workplace based on equality safety and work ethics.An amazing company to work for, overall punctuality is a must and they are very strong as an unit."
good,"Tech Data is a great place to work with good people who work there."
good,"Tech Data goals and mission are sales, sales, sales. They could become great with very little efforts: educated management leadership, incentives to promote formal education, and IT infrastructure and software upgrades."
good,Overall culture and climate are ideal for creative and business alike. They have decent amenities and you feel like you dont have to leave the compound once you are settled in.
good,"Management was very friendly and always able to chat from the beginning of my Tech Data experience to the end."
good,Tech Data is a good place to work with a complete freedom to work independently and achieve your targets. Management is very well organized. It is a very competitive place to work at.
good,Lots of opportunity for education and experience.  Flexibility to move within various departments to find the role that suits you best.  Great benefits.
good,"my day to day responsibilities are managing off accounts and the monthly targets of cash collections, resolving of queries by the customer and by the sales department to ensure all invoices are paid by the customers agreed payment terms"
good,"Fast paced work environment.  So many talented employees, true ""team environment"".  Culturally diverse workplace, many onsite clubs/organizations and support from management staff."
good,"developed and managed national accounts in houston area and then in the los angelas CA area, worked with accounts that did over five million a year in overall IT sales"
good,"Management team are really nice people, if you have any question they will assist you, and the only thing not good about this job, is the you get a .25 cent raise every year, and is hard if you want to advance.."
good,I have no real complaionts except for the pay but the company does hold events for us and has a good work environment. Ive been here 2 years and already got promoted.
good,Great company to start your career and advance is nearly impossible.   People in the company are great.  Benefit and employer RRSP contribution are nice.   Management is ok.
good,"Co-workers were friendly and helpful"
good,"A typical day involved me checking emails from clients and returning quotes within a reasonable timeframe. Check the pipeline for opportunities presenting themselves. make and receive calls from clients to ensure proper product and software are integrated together."
good,Large amounts of email and phone calls in a cubicle. Company tries to make work fun and sometimes succeeds.
good,"At Tech Data no two days are the same. Due to the nature of the I.T. industry and everchanging customer needs the need to adapt to different situations on a day to day basis is instrumental. You have to be able to balance administrative work with proactive sales activites such as calling out to your client base. Through Tech Data I learned a lot in terms of active ways to sell, different approaches on how to penetrate client accounts and grow business effectively. The hardest part of the job is balancing the low pay and the amount of work that needs to be done. Most enjoyable part of the job is the environment and if you're a salesperson the everchanging market."
good,Great place to work with the most amazing people ever! I enjoyed every day that I worked there.
good,"Arrivée a 8h."
good,"Tech Data had a relaxed work atmosphere, that will keep you busy. There are plenty of opportunities available. They provide adequate on the site training."
good,"Felt bad just about management and extra hours. There you must finish all day targets, no matters what time that will be. Sometimes finishing earlier, sometimes late. Anyway all hours are paid fair :)"
good,"aperta e disponibile alle esigenze personali."
good,You are given all the training necessary to be successful in your job. You work in a team environment.There are many people around you that are eager to help. Management  wants you to be honest and open but being friends with management helps you get out of trouble. ASRs are requested to be perfect but most vendors only recognize the IARs on the team.
good,Overall a good company to work for. Steady work with possibilities in either promotions or career changes. Tech Data offers all the common benefits in a corporate company.
good,Large Corporation with excellent opportunities for advancement and growth. Very diversified and moving towards a better work life balance. Great benefits.
good,bonne amibiance de travail avec de super responsable
good,"Great place to work.. but, could have better Salary for the experienced employees. plus, they do not offer Remote access. Great bunch of people to wirk with."
good,"Arbetsplats med högt tempo, och roliga uppgifter. Mycket varierande arbetsdagar."
good,Day to day work can be very stressful requiring long hours. Great opportunity to learn logistics. The management team worked well together but there was a lot of separation between logistics and corporate.
good,"High Paced environment, collaborative work with enablers, driven outcomes. "
good,Large corporation that tries to engage with its employees as much as possible. I learned a lot of business skills from working at Tech Data. Very much cubical style work.
good,"TechData is a positive environment,  My contract ended because there was no room in the budget to renew my contract.  They initially do a 30 day contract to get the contractor in the door"
good,"Techdata provided a comfortable space for employees to flourish. A typical day in the warehouse would consist of arriving early to chat with other employees in a lounge area for about 10 minutes before starting work. As soon as you stepped into the warehouse the culture shifted to a more competitive and fast paced atmosphere. With not much time to relax, the work demanded your full attention and dedication the job at hand. Only postive things can be taken away from this experience as I learned how to stay on task and get a job done while limiting myself to any distractions. The hardest part of the job was coping with the hot and humid work envirionment in the mezzanine and not letting that effect how well you perform the task. The company provided many facilities to help employees cope with the heat. The most enjoyable part was how the job required you to think and react quickly. Speed and accuracy was essential to being successful and I enjoyed always having to be on my toes."
good,"I would recommend it.  Largest IT distributor in the world.  There is a good opportunity.  There are competitors that are cheaper and will win on that.  However, Tech Data, by far, has the best customer service and that's how Tech Data wins."
good,This is a great company to work for. They have an amazing culture and a great campus. The Contracts department is okay but is grossly underpaid. The company really needs to invest in their people.
good,The work environment is one of typical corporate culture.  The reporting structure is layered and work days in IT are typical of support and project work.  Work and life balance are very easily achieved and encouraged.
good,"I was given an opportunity with no experience into an office environment. Overall it is a good place to get a start. I was a switchboard operator, and had a good time."
good,"Tech Data was overall a great place to work. High volume work environment,  Management overall fair. Great benefits. Hardest part of the job going with the flow, Enjoyed the type of work I did."
good,while at tech data i learned how to operate the stand up forklift and i also maintained the dock unloading and unloading trucks. I did find it difficult to proceed working there just due to the fact that it was a lot of dysfunction while working there
good,"Tech Data sales has a fun environment! They are also great with career development and helping you reach your goals within the company. Additionally, they offer great benefits such as tuition reimbursement and company wide appreciation lunches."
good,a typical day at work i come in at midnight have pre shift meeting talk about what need to be done and then strech then get job done i learn how to drive high reach and unload n load trucks managment is ok they should get involved more the hardest part is really staying up go 12 hours
good,"Angenehmer Arbeitgeber"
good,Assisted inbound callers with product information and issuing returns for product. Advanced quickly. Over all a nice place to work.
good,My current role is very varied. I manage the UK corporate events on my own and manage the Public Sector quarterly marketing campaigns.
good,"TD a great company to work for, fast paced and employees can build a future with supportive career development and financial wellness programs."
good,"Working with upper and lower management was important.  I was able to work with vendors, managers, team managers and staffs of various teams, company reps, end users.................all taught me the ""newest and best"" in the computer world.  What a job!"
good,"Près de 1000 salariés en France"
good,Good people to work with in every department. Events on campus to get employees together on special occasions. Management lets you get your work done around life events.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, se valora a los empleados y se les motiva a aprender"
good,"Potential to move up"
good,"Tech Data is a distributor of I.T. hardware, software and service products.  Tech Data sold product through our reseller partners."
good,"If you have drive to make the most of it, I think Tech Data is an amazing school and can help you advance in your career. It can become very easy to become comfortable in a position and get stuck before you know it. "
good,"always learning new things, no stress, great managers, learned about new systems, projects. "
good,"40 hours , very fast place environment , plenty company's BBQ and fun time   , Christmas and other party's , people friendly and most manager friendly"
good,"Good environment and pleasant place to work. Supportive colleagues and managers. Good benefits except health insurance. Flexible schedule, teamwork, detail oriented"
good,was een zeer leuke ervaring. iedereen was vriendelijk en ze waren allemaal bereid om de studenten te helpen.
good,"Working at Tech Data was an excellent experience.  I enjoyed liked the management, and enjoyed the challenging projects I was given during my 19 year tenure."
good,"Tech Data is an easy and good place to get an entry level job in the corporate office world. The pay is low but you gain a lot of skills you can take else where. "
good,"I developed a medical condition that required me to take longer lunches than normal, they were NOT flexible regarding this despite claiming to be flexible. I was let go as a result of basically almost working my a ss off."
good,Mooie organisatie waar veel talent zit en waar je te maken krijgt met veel uitdagingen en kansen om middels die uitdagingen persoonlijke en professionele groei te bewerkstelligen.
good,"You get to work with some bright minds, amazing, talented people."
good,Je reviendrai plus tard pour donner mon avis a propos de Tech Data
good,"This is a good company to work for, as a full-time employee. Temp to hire, they tend to drag their feet in the hiring process. People have bills and kids to put on insurance."
good,"I was a Sales Engineer for APC and would take inbound calls from authorized resellers to help them design backup power systems for large server rooms. Also would provide training to sales team on new products."
good,"I have been extremely dedicated, motivated, and enthusiastic in securing successful distribution and supply to various companies; and now wish to extend this success to your company."
good,"mission très enrichissante,  j’étais en charge de la production des états financiers et des différents supports d’analyse destinés aux managers."
good,A lot of opportunity depending on your experience and education. Hard to get use to a desk job if you've never had one prior. Great accepting atmosphere.
good,"Fun place to work, great benefits. The pay is bad, and hours are too. Give discounts to employees with their product. Healthy company with a young staff."
good,"Tech Data is an awesome place to work in my opinion. Relaxed environment, but everyone is a hard worker! Work life balance is great and management does work with you."
good,Learned alot about marketing and corporate lifestyle. I would recommend someone who would like to know what a day to day is like in a corprate atmosphere to try this internship out. You will learn alot about social media marketing if you use your time right.
good,"This company is corporate ran. Communication in this facility is either bad or non-existent. Accountability is seldom addressed and a management team that would rival the three stooges. Overtime is abundant. "
good,"*Business en perpétuel développement  ( inbound / outbound)"
good,It was very easy to work at Tech Data because work load was very less.It got tough only few times. Supervisors were friendly and supportive in all tasks.Co-workers were all nice and hardworking.Pay was also good and there was a lot to learn.
good,"Über mangelnde Arbeit kann man sich bei TD bestimmt nicht beschweren."
good,"Tech Data Canada resists the business model of squeezing the life out of it's employees."
good,"Fantastic learning experience, have advanced into several roles, like any large fortune 200 company going to have some politics, but the people are great and the you can touch a lot of different technology. With Tech Data being on the distribution side of IT, financial compensation is not the best, but combined wit benefits, perks, company's stability it's fair."
good,"Read thorugh Emails, prepare quote, achieve sales quota"
good,"Responded to calls as well as request via emails. Follow up with the customers. Management is always willing to assist. Work good  with one another, team player. The hard part about the job is to tell our customer No. Coming to work everyday and know that we are helping the customers."
good,Management is highest level of ethical and capable skills. The culture is very fast paced and technology environment.
good,Compañía multinacional con buenas practicas gerencia les.
good,"Tech Data was an excellent place to work and doing tradeshows I learned extensively about time-management and controlling a budget. Tradeshows are very tangible in that you plan them and learn from what went wrong to improve the next one. The atmosphere was high pressure, but I enjoy getting the job done and performing well."
good,"Constantly involved in complex problem solving. Most days work/life balance is great, but be prepared for some 13 to 16 hour days. I have learned a great deal in my current position within the company and continue to grow."
good,Ottima azienda. Ambiente di lavoro stimolante. Consigliato.
good,Two thumbs up great job you’ll like it great benefits paid biweekly drama free atomphrase  everybody easy to get along with nice break room you’ll enjoy your employment at tech data
good,"Loads trailers for different clients. the workers are great and the management staff works with everyone to succeed. "
good,"Although Tech Data is a great company, distribution in general is a grind.  They tend to pay lower salaries and its a hard push.  Tech Data does do a good job at trying to show appreciation with awards and recognition."
good,Tech Data was a great place to work.  The people I worked with as well as management were great.  The company has grown a lot since I left and don't know how this may have changed things.
good,Enjoyed working for Techdata. Worked on various projects and got exposure to alot of different clients and technologies. Would highly recommend the company.
good,best team ever.  Average was very good experience.

good,I held several positions at Tech Data and each department I worked in was pleasant. I enjoyed working with the management and co-workers.
good,"Overall, Tech Data provides a positive work environment and plenty of opportunity for advancement. Beware of many old-timers that do nothing but complain on a daily basis, soon jading your view of the environment. Just remain confident that you'll have more responsibility, more visibility and probably slightly better pay than something else you would be doing with the same credentials. If you come in on the bottom floor and work hard, you can be promoted very quickly. The only downside to this is that you end up with managers and directors that sometimes are not up to the job of dealing with vendors and difficult situations that could arise in the business relationships."

They even considered the rising living wages at the time to implement a pay increase for all employees.  However, they've turned away from working with temporary agencies."
good,Great company but Corporate team leaders did not invest in people builder or growing skillsets outside of daily tasks. Hardest part of the job would be the long hours worked during quarter and year end close.

The work can be hard and you are not done until all the orders have shipped for the day.  Outbound operations begin a 1400 with no set completion time.  High contingent workforce as business is driven by consumer demand and must flex.
good,"Each department at Tech Data is different and the company allows you to really take control over your career and work to achieve what you want to. Other than a one year transfer policy, many employees move frequently between departments and positions."

The benefits are great (unlimited PTO, affordable health insurance etc) and the working hours are good. My only complaint is they pay VERY low compared to their competition and have layoffs each quarter. Most people spend a few years there to build skills and then move on to higher paying companies where there is more stability and growth potential. Overall, I enjoyed my time at Tech Data."
good,"If you are willing to grow and also to put in the desired hardwork, you will get that growth. I quickly had the growth I wanted by putting in the required effort which went recognized by the senior management of the logistics center."

good,"Ambiente molto grande e collaborativo, stipendio buono ed ottimo trattamento del personale"
good,"Overall the people and company is great!  Recent management was import for competitor and the management style and leadership went WAY DOWN!  New management is taking a successful culture and process and changing it to show they are the ""smartest in the room"" and its not a true cultural fit.  Limiting advancement and anyone that questions their authority.  Would I recommend working their, yes if you have the right manager!  It can and will be a great place to work again, once this experiment is over."

For instance, the clothes that I will be wearing, I also make sure that the alarm clock is set at the correct time. Then I arrive to work 10 minutes before my  shift starts. The reason I do that is because I like to make sure that all my tools are ready and properly working. "

good,"Great people and a great place to work.  Downside, most vendor lines positions are funded by the manufacturers, not Tech Data, so if the manufacturer does not renew the head count funding, or changes the rolls, if no immediate availability to migrate to another role, you will be laid off.  Other than that, great company and many excellent managers and employees.  Benefits are good, not excellent, but the environment on the Product Marketing side is awesome, sales side, hit or miss."

I was a packer so i would go to the packing station area, there items would come down the belt to be packaged, labeled and put on a different belt to be shipped out for customers. Some orders would be very tedious but patience is the key. Everyone would have one break depending on how many hours we were working that day.

Everyone is always so helpful and dependent."

good,"Wonderful company and people! If only the starting pay were higher, I would have stayed. When you consider a salary of 30,000 per year and the hours worked, it only came out to about 14 per hour and once benefits were taken out, the take home every two weeks was around 700 per paycheck. But the company itself is amazing!"

good,"It is super great considering it is my first job after graduation. Company culture and colleagues are super great. Employee will support each other. Considering ""we"" instead of ""I"". However, most of the work duty is repeated, short of renovation and advanced tech. Once there is some change on vendor side or the customer side, it takes a long time for the company to adapt."

good,"Es una empresa donde confia 100% en el empleado , donde te garantiza tu sueldo y bono por tres meses, dandote las herramientas de trabajo necesarioas como celular , computadora , taxi , erramientas de oficina para el cumplimiento de tus ventas y objetivos, un dia normal es llegar  y ver que cada quien esta en su roll , vez mucho  movimiento en oficina, entran y salen  ya que tu trabajo es 80% en campo , aprendi  a trabajar  por ibjetivos  , metas , conocer los diferentes tipos de clientes , negociacion ,  tienes todo el apoyo por parte de gerencia y rh, trabajas muyt de cerca con ellos para el ucmplimiento de  objetuvo  no tanto de tu marca si no de la empresa,  es dificil que puedas ver a tus compañeros de trabajo ya que cada quien esta trabajando en sus objetivos y  se pueden encontrar con clientes dentro y fuera de la ciudad, la parte mas dificil del trabajo son los dias de cierre por la presion que se maneja ese dia ya que tienes hra de entrada mas no de salida , llegando a salir hasta la 1 am o 2 pm  dependiendo de que se facture todo tu producto , asi como cumplir no solo tu meta de ventas si no la de la empresa . Lo que mas me gusto de techdata es  la confianza  y el aprender a trabajar en equipo asi como individualmente, las capacitaciones constantes y el cercamiento de todo el personal  con direccion."

While the training structure is effective, the team structure for handling accounts is ever-changing, and not always for the better.

I did enjoy how welcoming vendors were with lots of good snacks to boost morale."
