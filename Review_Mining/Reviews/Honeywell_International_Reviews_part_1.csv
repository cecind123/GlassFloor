rating,review
bad,"Toxic, poor management, hourly fight salary. No trust, no teamwork, no support. People stay for decent pay only. Very toxic work environment. Don't expect any support or training. Managers yell at operators."
bad,We were put into pairs by race.  Temps worked  extremely hard while permanent people sat around and chit chat.  We were not allowed to talk at all even if we were discussing when a particular  part would be in. Very  Degrading place to work. When I was discussing a part that I need my Manager came up behind me and said Work! Work! Work!  No talking.   I can tell ya I was one of the best workers there and I was furious!
bad,I would not have anyone i like work at Honeywell it is a hostile work place. They care more about the share holders then the employees.. Would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"Cheap company, does not care about employees , is a show off company, benefits are treaky and get worse every year, management only care about themselves, employees in general have check on each other and it gets really bad even checking the way you drive and park your car, or when you go to the bathroom."
bad,"Will sell you a dream it’s all lies! They have an archaic management style, they think employees are expendable, they discriminate against women. Run!"
bad,"Honeywell is full of policies, but their management and staff do not follow these policies. Managers do not provide proper resources for projects to save money and when the client complains, the blame will be on the employee."
bad,The time I worked for Honeywell I did not see the concerns or respect for the employees from middle management. I was blackballed from ever gaining employment there because I voiced my concerns about it.
bad,"Management does not care about their employee.Even Internal Job opportunity is fixed before vacancy is created.No on job training,extended working hour,working environment not good full of conspiracy & department politics."
bad,"Discrimination is at all time high. Work values are horrible. Management doesn't have a clue. Hourly people have no job security. Unless your salary, you don't exist. Faulty machines. Dangerous work conditions."
bad,"While completing every task assigned to me on a daily basis, often stepping in and assisting others with their jobs until completion i was interviewed two seperate times and waited for a job offer. While they hired external and less qualified applicants than what they had working the job. I would not have wasted my time at this company knowing they were going to let me go a few days before Christmas."
bad,"Two thumbs down for management, company and work security. Benefits are the worst, pay is well under the national average,  they treat you like a skave"
bad,The management teams are the worst they have know clue what goes on in production. Can't keep H.R. people  .T.A don't know there jobs. They make to many  mistakes and we have to fix them.
bad,"I was very excited to join Honeywell, but that excitement quickly wore off. There is no work/life balance - even though they say there is with ""unlimited vacation days."" The workload is so great there's no way to take time off without killing yourself first. To say there's a micromanagement culture is an understatement. Every little thing is dictated by your managers. They hold ""brainstorming"" meetings, but really they want things done their way; your opinion means nothing, even when the project is derailing because of them. It's an abusive environment where it's typical for a manager to ""support"" something privately, but then in a broader meeting throw you under the bus as soon as someone outside the group has a different reaction."
bad,The last 5 years was hard working at Honeywell International Ottawa. I have been put in a position where I must take on new roles without discussing these new roles as part of my job at EMS and have done the best to learn them and execute them well.
bad,Ok to work with Honeywell. Management need to work on their employees concerns and issues. All benefits are for leadership and management. They should adhere to their policies which are already in place.
bad,"unfair, bias. the culture is very down beat. very few people do their jobs. training for jobs is some times inadaquate. supervisors never on floor or for very short time."
bad,"I was not at the company long enough to form an opinion on job work/life balance, compensation/benefits, job security/advancement, management, or job culture. I was a contract employee"
bad,"dont work here. this place is not a place for advancing in any career, not a place for people who are married and starting a family. not family oriented at all."
bad,Bought the company I worked for. Complete overhaul of management. Loss of major customers. A great company turned toxic. Cut us down to 4 days a week and tried to force us to use vacation for the fiffth
bad,Honeywell place is good to work environment. Work life balance is also available.  Salary is also good. Career growth is expected every year. Overall good.
bad,Place is nothing but drama and management fuels it. There's no confidentiality there so if you have to turn someone in for safety violations or harassment then management will just turn around and tell them what was said and then they go after you again as management turns a blind eye
bad,if immediate manager is a dummy then there is no room for growth or advance or even recognition. salary is way below average in industry. Salary will never grow more than 1% per year.
bad,"Almost work for 10 hours per day without much break time in between. And few more hours on weekend to complete the daily routine work , just daily operations work , not able to complete during working hours due to most of the working time are occupied by meetings. Every day meeting with direct manager to report issue status and work progress. Micro managed ... culture of Honeywell"
bad,"Siempre quieren ahorrar en todo, eso hace que la maquiladora parezca de bajos recursos"
bad,"Horrible health care benefits, better wages at many other places, push product for revenue and management  bonuses, expect  everyone to work weekends and holidays, The overall culture is repulsive."
bad,It the worst company to work for in the world to many bosser to work people not a good place to be no one wanterd to come to work long days and short nights
bad,The biggest problem is the benefits. $600 a month for insurance with 6000-9000 dollar deductable. This from a company that made 24 billion dollars last year.
bad,I would never nor would I ever suggest working for this toxic company. Please beware because they are racist and phony. They act like they care about you but they dont. It about the dollar.
bad,The culture here sucks They do not recognize the  Talents for within The supervisors feel like they picked him out of a jacker crack Box... Find ways not to give you a raise. But they will   Reward you with pizza for all your hard work...I understand u have bill to pay but  You won't be here long  People that be here for years ..leave
bad,"Honeywell’s goal is to move everything out of the US including design. By the time I retired it wasn’t a good place to work anymore."
bad,"I saw company that I was proud to be a part of go to a place that I am truly ashamed to be associated with. Advancement comes from cutting you coworkers throat and kissing up to your superiors. When I started in this job we were quality at all cost driven, now its all about meeting your metrics. Using non approved parts are the norm now where that would have gotten you fired years ago. I have hated working there for years but have stuck it out just to get to retirement. Now the company has relocated to Olathe and I am trying to find another job."
bad,The mgr i worked for had MANY complaints against her. She was allowed to continue her inappropriate behavior. As a result i lost my job without cause and was a top performer. She finally got too many complaints months later and was fired. Id also like to say the favoritism ended with her but didnt.
bad,Management tells you one thing does another. This creates a culture of confusion. They are open to suggestions but turn them around to make them their own without giving you credit for any of it. If management likes you it is tolerable to work there. But if they don't they will do everything they can to make you unhappy with your job.
bad,Hardest part was working with the supervisors. And not telling us anything due to overtime or working days. They just freestyle and have everyone do everything
bad,"Tip as a contractor, you are overloaded with work.equipment outdated. No one wants to assist you. You are basically thrown under the bus if a mistake occurs working with an employee."
bad,Honeywell is the biggest joke of a shop I’ve ever work. The leads are lazy and not worth a darn. Nobody ever knew what was going on and then at a moments notice will shift change you. Not worth the little pay they offer.
bad,"Management needs a complete overhaul on the Production side.  Joining the R&O side is your better bet.  Otherwise, its a fun and enjoyable place to work!"
bad,Very stressful work environment and little room for growth. The company seems to be restructuring for the past 7-9 years. Not a reliable place to have a long term career.
bad,Very poor leadership.  Inventory was atrocious.  Management was very unsupportive and reactive instead of proactive.  Leads run the floor and are pretty much expected to have the role and responsibilities of a Supervisor without the authority of one.  High levels of favoritism shown by management.
bad,"7 days a week your first three year. Don't let's the hourly rate fool you.... Insurance 8k and 100 week... Union dues 2 1/2 hours pay. Hot dirty... A O sucks."
bad,"I wasn't at Honeywell very long, but long enough to know why others don't stay there as well.  The management there made you work long hours with no incentive to enjoy life."
bad,"Very unorganized "
bad,Supervisors lack experience and don't know what they're doing. High turnover. Too much politics going on and you gotta be a butt-kisser to get promoted. They'll somehow try to get rid off you if they don't like you. Too many people quit and move on to other companies all the time. They hire a lot of Asian and African refugees to get tax breaks. Mexicans work there don't get along with other race. Always blame other people for their own mistakes. bad job culture. Only the people with no education and no job skills stay at Honeywell.
bad,12 hrs shifts two 20 min breaks an one 30min break  on your feet none stop till  break time really have to go an i really mean go an beyond an complain bout gettin a raise or if u are doin another job that u are trained on u should be getting that pay
bad,Management uncaring I would not recommend it to anyone they play favorites and after your probation period they let you go so they don't have to pay for insurance
bad,Unfortunately the working culture is toxic and they are not very employee friendly.
bad,"Horrible management. If it's not beneficial to the company, there's no benefits for the employees! "
bad,"At ends with the course the last 2 years I received insight the temps and employees who worked under contract to the Delmar,NY facility for experiencing Great Lengths of racial discrimination at the workplace... Instead of reviewing, management is avoiding and overlooking... The temps then simply terminated new hires and new hires are brought on to avoid the issue... this is wrong."
bad,"Losing alot of customers because of poor quality on there gears. Alot of favoritism in the work place. Management treating employees disrectful and not caring about the employees. Feels like working in a sweat shop. Management dont care what the employees think or say. They always can replace you for someone else that pays less. The company only cares about making money and saving money. Terrible place to work and alot of stress and tiredness. If you have a family, you won't have time to spend with because you work almost every day."
bad,"The hours were late, I was doing more work than a new contract should have and was taking in extra responsibility just to attempt to advance, still let go over incredibly simple mistake."
bad,poor management. The company allowed full time employees to treat others with disrespect. The management allowed temp workers to word harder than fulltime employees
bad,"First, it's insulting to think this day and age they feel someone can survive off the amount they pay employees. I worked third shift and that whole environment was unprofessional. People watching YouTube videos while working, watching movies on their phone, the team lead playing candy crush on her phone. They claim we're not supposed to have drinks on the floor unless it's in a red cup they provide us but everyone including the team lead has water bottles, soda bottles and every other drink on the floor. The team lead is a no call no show at least once a week. She's not salary based but shows up whenever she feels like it and she sleeps half the night at work. That was the most unprofessional work environment I have ever been in. No room to climb the ladder and advance in position in that place either. I do not recommend working there"
bad,"bad Company to work for. Managers and Leaders have made this company as non workable .  Better to be jobless than joining this company. HR are for name sake.  There are lot of issues, In skip level meeting when i reported  issues to Director, I got the reply that you will be habitual to bad culture in few months."
bad,"The manager for this position is a specially very immature individual that prefers convenience above engineering ethics. He prefers to have always the last word even if he is wrong. He is not a PE and is not familiar with Engineering Ethics. He does not have proper knowledge of Structural Engineering and will yell to you if you come with something different. If you stand by your ethics he will fire you and will deduct all PDH and any other paid by the company from your last salary. There are not chairs with head rests. If you ask for one they will try to set up your workstation and you will not be able to move it unless you stop them before. No offices, everybody on isles of desktops. Insurance to expensive, high deductible of $3000 and to reach it it has to be on the insurance company prices for medical services. They will send you to visit gas plants without gas monitor. They want you to do what they want even if it's wrong. If you find mistakes on their previous engineering they will fire you. The nice decoration will make you think you are in the best place to work."
bad,"Does not take care of their people, lie about benefits. Left almost immediately after getting started. Failed to address abuse from government management to the employees. I was the 7th or 8th person to leave this position because of poor management and support. Lied to me about 401k rollover during shift to KBRwyle, no contributions or matches for 6 months. Would never work for or with either company again."
bad,"Jefe con favoritismo hacia otros empleados.  Competencia entre los empleados de un mismo equipo para sobresalir.  Sabotaje entre los miembros del mismo equipo para tomar el crédito del trabajo que no hacen.  No hay privacidad, hay constantes reclamaciones del jefe delante de otros jefes y empleados.  No hay lugar para subir de puesto aunque se trabaje horas extras y se entregue trabajo a tiempo.  "
bad,Very poor management here. Manager in charge of the Thaad Program did the very minimum. He never came to night shift to see what was going on. Manager had no previous or college training and it showed. Very toxic work environment here. First shift hated third shift and did everything they could to cause problems for third shift. Management turned a blind eye to employee complaints and problems.
bad,"The terrible job aside they dont pay their employees for the hours they worked and when questioned about it the managers and payroll people blame it on the payroll software and if pressured about it they will shift the blame to the contract companies they go through (3 or 4 of them) so that you can't pin point who is responsible for not paying you the money for the work that you did. I have talked with many co-workers and it is a common problem but it is tangled up in so much red tape, paper work, different software, different departments, managers, and payroll companies that none of the workers can do much about it and believe me we tried."
bad,It was one of the most depressing places I had every worked at. High Pressure SR. Buyer was badgered constantly Upper management in Michigan was lack of support.  Every week there was someone who was leaving the division
bad,they do not care so nobody else cares either. place is a dump. runs off scared people and over time. will work 3 shifts if they have to pull their 6 B.
bad,"Honeywell je to nejhorší co jsem ve své kariéře zažil. Naprosto otřesný a nefunkční systém managementu, tuny reportů které jsou zcela k ničemu, vedení člověka nutí aby šlapal po svých podřízených. Jeden zbytečný míting střída druhej. Člověk nemá čas na svou práci. Po 4 týdnech ve firme po mě šefka řvala co jí řeknu k pracovnímu výkonu, to jsem se měl reálne pořád zaučovat :-)"
bad,"management hires husband and wife team"
bad,I stage multiple box orders using a computers. Two supervisor were not even 25 years Old. They would send you out walking pushing carts with 200 300 lbs. Joke about how slow you were. No one can do better then them with there arms crossed doing nothing.
bad,Bij honeywell emmen geen leuke ervaring gehad ten eerste je komt niet in het groepje omdat je buiten gesloten word en totaal niet vriendelijk. plus ze hebben mij eruit gepest.
bad,My experience at Honeywell was very unbelievable. They are racist because their own kind is making more than other races. This is one of the reason they are always hiring and they been dealing with a lot of agencies. Company like will never good people working for them.
bad,"If you would like to work in a very stressful, competitive, tyrannical environment, then Honeywell is the place for you."
bad,Worst company I worked for next to UTC in Foley. They are horrible to work for as well. No work life balance. They expect you to work 60+hours a week.
bad,"At first I was really impressed with this employer. Such good stewards of the environment. Nice lunchrooms and facilities overall. Bike rack. Their training plans, structure,  and program is one of the best I've seen. However training moves at a snail's pace. My job wasn't even that hard. Very repetitive. Mostly everyone here was friendly. But then I started to notice the true nature of things here after a couple of days. Despite a higher pay rate here than my previous job, I was actually making slightly less because of such high taxes in the region. Mostly everyone here is a temp.They are so lacking in enough workers here that they can barely train individuals they hire. Also just pure unwillingness to train. Not many people stay here. Many quit on their own. They hire and then they fire. So basic math would tell me there is no difference and maybe even negative difference. There are people here that are supposed to act as leaders but instead act as focal points of conflict. Some will go out of their way to do little things things they know will upset an employee. They are hungry for conflict. They will find even the smallest things, and then make it into an enormous problem that has to go all the way to management. They carry themselves proudly as though they are above everyone else. Their actions and speech give all the tell tale signs of this. Some constantly say things like, "" I have witnesses"". I don't know how many times I heard that here but that alone with it being said so often is of concern. The people that are supposed to act as leaders here is very clearly why this"
bad,This company does not approve time off for anything. If you need a day off for a doctors appointment or anything it is automatically counted against you.
bad,"Extremely poor benefits"
bad,Awful work environment in IT after a bottom feeder IT company outbid the NT Data contract and forced current employees to take their lowball salary or a pay reduction with dreadful benefits. This company promised an SLA to Honeywell that was impossible at the expense of their own employees. Horrible work environment and no structure to their IT infrastructure. A place where people go to retire and do nothing that requires effort.
bad,"Fast paced, unconcerned with safety or quality. Workers stockpiling jobs to collect overtime. No checks and balances, bottom line did it ship. Supervision pushing inspectors to cut corners. Product incorrect for many years. No up-to-date blueprints many prints are incorrect because the company doesn't want to incur the cost of correcting the documents, kick-the-can down the road attitude. Management and supervision are in a mode of denial when it comes to schedules and the state of affairs. Improvements are stonewalled because those that are responsible to make improvements don't want to do the extra work. Faulty equipment not being bought to the attention of the customers so corrections can be made. Inspectors not being given proper specs to allow for a thorough review of the product. Inspection directed away from problem areas to focus on specific areas for blind inspection buyoff off of product. Special coating needed are unavailable in the paint area, so the coatings cannot be matched per blueprint, and the substitutions are not suitable."
bad,This was the worse employer I have ever worked for. Managers talk and treat you like kids and verbally abuse their empoyees. No raises for 3 yrs but purchased 2 companies during that time.
bad,"Unfair, Unpredictable, Very Poor Management Style!"
bad,"Verbally abusive environment with no respect for women. Career development non-existent. Unfair promotion practices. Poor management that cannot lead or direct staff. Older aged workforce. So, not the most progressive place to work."
bad,great place to work  the mangers were great .It had a on site café the prices were  and lots of vending machines and had a workout gym on site for only $ 15.00 a month
bad,Honeywell represent the all of the worst aspects that global capitalism has to offer. It's basically a holding company that has acquired multiple companies (along with their patents) over the past few years. They are now in the process of milking every last cent out of said companies and treating the employees as disposable cogs. Quality is secondary to cheap labor.
bad,"Le seul objectif poursuivi jusqu'au bout par Honeywell est de faire du ""cash"". Quelques soient le domaine, les prix fournisseurs sont tirés au maximum vers le bas ce qui empêche toutes relations cordiales, de confiance ou de partenariat."
bad,the channel can sell products better than Honeywell salespeople. Salespeople are overpaid and not needed. Channel sales people aren't needed either. The partners/resellers can use the internet to figure out the products
bad,"Horrible wnvitonment to work I , management never around and it’s who you know and not how you perform. It’s a buddy system and they are constantly letting their contract workers go, no consistency and attrition is high."
bad,"Super mal el nivel , en tijuana de las peores en mexico."
bad,"I wouldn’t come back to this place if they paid me a 100k. The supervisor, all over the place always overwhelmed NOT approachable. Training was a  disaster extremely unprofessional. Most of the time  "
bad,Stressful and too much travel in this job profile. No Training is given about the products. Will not recommend anybody to work here. very stressful and work/life balance is not possible.
bad,very unsafe work environment. Dangerous shortcuts taken by management and employees are injured. Nothing improved upon after several complaints made. had to leave.
bad,"I was hired to be an in house controls service technician for the VA Medical Center, but Honeywell brought back a retiree under another contractor to fill that position. They refused to train me aggressively so that they would not need that contractor."
bad,"I worked at Honeywell when going to college in the summer at BSD in Arlington Heights, Il. A much different place in the early 80's."
bad,The companies upper management is a joke they continuously make fun of their employees they have no social skills when talking to their employees just a bad staff selection entirely.
bad,"No training, poor treatment from supervisor, 60 hours or more a week. poor benefits that keep getting worse every year, people quitting in masses from Geneva Ohio plant"
bad,"Easy job , management sucks, supervisors are lazy they spend more time lookin for another job, if you’re. New you’ll make money if you’ve been there no"
bad,dont work her it isnt a good place to work at dont waste your time management is selfish they see you as another number not a person trust me its a waste of time id rather work at a call center and thats somethiing NO ONE SAYS
bad,"- Salary is not competitive against best SW companies in Brno"
bad,"Micro managed constantly, zero room for input for new ideas, it is by the the least innovative/progressive company I have ever worked for. Zero culture in the work place and over all just a drag to be there."
bad,I have nothing really to say about the company. My experience with the company was made by the employees on the job and not the job itself.. Lack of management and direction within staff.
bad,"Not a company to work for in the U.S because they are moving everything overseas."
bad,"too much pressure, Leadership sets you up for failure, no incentive to stay, supposedly you have unlimited vacation time but management won't give you consecutive days off"
bad,The management a supervisors allow employees to play on their cell when they should be working. This is the main reason why the company has to work their people 10 hours a day six days a week.
bad,Honeywell has become increasingly worse in the last year.  Not a place I would recommend at all.  Everything is based on metrics and you don't have time to do your real job.
bad,"Honeywell suck as an organization they do not take care of there people,  I worked at the company for 2 years and I was furloughed 4 times for a total of 4 weeks ..."
bad,"No respect, people are nasty. Plus supervisor think is ok when a person gets harrass, bullying. For the low pay we as operator have to do team leader jobs, babysit, like if we are working with kids."
bad,Not a great place to work. They don't look after their employees. Not good benefits. Hours work good. Didn't stay to busy but it was okay day to day. Wish they took better care of their employees
bad,Made safety products and packed them . I got laid off from that job was temp job. Had poor management.Was very hard to work for they wanted to work fast paced. The best part of the job were the people you work with
bad,"12-16 hour shifts physically and mentally drain you, poor management blames operators for everything. you have no life outside work. Lack of benefits and motives to do anything"
bad,"Poorly managed company. Only concern of upper management is the stock price. Don't care about their employees. Furloughs, layoffs, reductions on benefits. Don't work here unless you have no other alternatives. If you do work for them, keep looking elsewhere."
bad,"Horrible culture of metrics management, no manager would do the right think, they will only follow the metrics, Yield, EEI, etc...  Not an innovative company"
bad,Was part of the Intermec purchase by Honeywell.  Nothing but lies and changes every day.  It was a great day to have my last day with the creepy non american company. I hope all of it goes to India.
bad,"not a good place to work. under staffed as most of the time you will be doing a two man job. under paid and management is not great, and that's the main reason they can't keep anyone"
bad,Lotsa modern jargon filled pep talk from upper management.  If you try to do any of it you will be fired.  Recent history is they have three layoffs a year and unpaid furloughs.  Management keeps trying to sell off the working bits to meet quarterly profits for CEO Perks.  Almost everything here is a lie.  If they could replace you with a day laborer from in front of a home depot they would.  Management tells you you are replaceable and expendable every day.   Most new work is being sent to overseas workers that earn pennies a day.  You can tell from the 20-30 year old prison cube interior that you are a hamster on a treadmill and they want to whip you and whip you until you train your overseas replacement then leave or die.  Come here if you want to see what was once great in America die from management greed and Globalism.
bad,"People are great but ,management in Riverside is horrible. Favoritism and Nepatism is huge here if you don't have family here you will be skipped over for promotions. In the last 7 months 7 operators have quit. They all left for jobs that pay more.And management will say they are competitive. I just quit am a lot happier."
bad,No hacen promociones en almacen y no existe el plan de carrera para un almacenista.RH deja mucho que desear
bad,My manager has no back bone. Does not seek out the facts from both the customer and the employee. Management takes what the customer says as the truth.
bad,Typical day at Honeywell was doing rework after rework. Having to deal with bad mangement. The hardest part of the day was standing all day. The most enjoyable part of the job were the co-worker pot lucks.
bad,Worst company to work for. Constantly working towards firing you or cutting your benefits while demanding more output out of you. Will reprimand you for even a minute of overtime.
bad,"never do contract work for honeywell. this is not a place to work or gain experience. "
bad,This is not the place you want to work at. Very long hours for little pay and no raises. They reward you in pizza and everyone tries to be your boss. No one wants you to do well and they all try to get you fired.
bad,"Bad management, bad trainers, bad work atmosphere. Trainers train very little in fear of losing their position. Management had favorites. A lot of senior employers degrading you, inappropriate conversations and HR cannot do nothing about it."
bad,"A day at work consist of wondering if we're going to get another 14 month lockout vacation come contract time, or when the next layoff will come in the name of ""we're broke and need to save $10 million""? The one thing that I have learned is that it is not the quality of work an employee performs, but how good the numbers look on tier boards. This place used to be impossible to get hired on at but now requires just a pulse and desire to work in the name of continuous improvement with benefits equal to that offered by Dollar General. For a corporation this size and the skeleton crew running Metropolis PMT, they could pay 100% benefits and never miss a beat. There was never any turnover before 2010 and now its a revolving door. It is staggering number of employees leaving, and for good cause. To see the people come and go on the salary and hourly side and just one reason is no incentive to stay here. New hires have no pension like the senior employees. $7000.00 is what generally comes out of your paycheck per year for your cost on healthcare, dental,vision. A $7200.00 deductible if you get injured and $8000.00 for the wife and kids a piece. HR scratches their heads wondering why people are hunting jobs and leaving by the rail car load. Workplace culture is like being pecked to death by chickens. I don't know where the morale supposedly begins, but I know where it ends, the parking lot right before you walk in! The hardest part of the job is seeing that there is no respect for employees anymore and it's hard to go anywhere but down from that point. Pensions are being froze for the"
bad,"will relocate to China."
bad,"Very bad managers focused on short term gains to boost their bonuses in year end"
bad,"Find an active or past employee and ask them about the Metropolis facility. I'm sure your mind will be changed about working here. If you have no job at all, then by all means come and get that resume built up and within a year you'll be beating the bushes trying to find a good employer all the while asking yourself as of why you made the mistake of accepting a position here! Some of the coworkers are really good and help full."
bad,"They put non-technical managers in charge of technical groups.  There is a clear lack of concern for the employs, and policies were crafted to always give management the upper hand and put employees down."
bad,It's an easy job the hours are good but they will plot to get rid of you everyone will know your getting fired before it happens it's like going to school all over again people constantly telling on the other management is poor I know corporate doesn't know how things are been done
bad,"Honeywell has long degraded the experience of employees.  I would not advise someone to take work here if they have alternatives.  The company's only focus is on share price and the next 90 days."
bad,"Very poor management in Honeywell, India in 2017"
bad,"the warehouse merged 3 warehouses into 1, no care of your sitiuation, management  was good till weasal had to out weasal the others to keep their job, very depressing, you could work any hrs from 8 to 12 on any giving day, with no respect or apprecatition"
bad,"when i worked here the company decided to go to china, lots of people were laid off and it was not good. the products were ok. sometimes made crummy but quality control often caught it"
bad,"Do not work here. They are cutting benefits, cutting vacation and holidays. They took away work from home. Do not consider this job unless you are really needy. There is no assigned seating and you will have no desk as it is open space. No privacy whatsoever. Go elsewhere as they are trying to force people out now."
bad,"Company is going down hill. Nothing good to look forward too, no future, and I feel sorry for folks who have been there so long they are basically stuck. Do not put yourself through the ups and downs of worrying about your job every day."
bad,"Hired mass numbers of employees for a short time to complete a project, laid them all off once the project was completed. Horrible morale, not a place you want to work at."
bad,job was extremely intense and I was required to work very long hours including weekends. Our team went from 7 people down to 2 with no replacements. Was not a fun environment and was in fact was nasty and unethical place to work. The hardest parts was trying to flow down unrealistic initiatives.
bad,"SuperString is a horrible department to work in. I have been here for 4 years and they have changed our schedule more than 15 times. They have a high favoritism, high turnover rate, morale is very low. Would not recommend anyone to this department."
bad,I don't know why anyone works here. We don't even get dental insurance! Come one come all if you like to take 4 weeks with no pay a year. BUT all executives have had NO compensation cuts.
bad,"a typical day at work, programming"
bad,"Management is a joke! It's all about numbers.. Little by little this company is taking away benefits, and anything good about it. Little chance for moving forward in your career. Better off somewhere else. Think one star is being nice."
bad,"testing board every day, learned some trick from co worker, manager is ok, coworker are helpful and willing to help when need"
bad,Healthy Working Environment.  Spend around 10 + years at same organisation. I got good learning opportunities at Honeywell.
bad,"7 day staggered swing shift makes your co-workers more like family than your actual family. Used to be a good place to work, still has some great people to work with but poor management and corporate greed are destroying the morale of the employees. Temp to hire in production, constant reductions (budget and manpower) in both production and maintenance. Currently dividing the location and its employees due to ""spin-off' with employees being selected by an agenda. World class company with poverty level insurance; Currently the hardest part is actually going to work and the most enjoyable part is leaving at the end of the shift."
bad,"The work environment is awful. The supervisor was very unprofessional, yelling at employees while customers were present, creating a very tense uncomfortable environment."
bad,"This was also a temporary stop off job before looking into something long term. The company itself is a good place to work, but there is no room for advancement."
bad,Honeywell has to be one of the most greediest companies that I have ever had the displeasure of working for. They expect you to work a min of 60 hours a week and not receive anything extra for it. The pay initially looks great until they hit you with the hidden disclaimer of actual work hours. The insurance is horrible and they are self funded. I would compare Honeywell to a company that advertises a low price to get you in the door then hits you with hidden fees.
bad,I was a great employee my second day on the job I was training new employees coming in. But office politics and bad management made me leave.
bad,"Same as before. No changes. "
bad,"Honeywell are only worried about numbers,not you the employee.Don't care if you're genuinely off sick.Management are like robots."
bad,"Had a few trouble makers at Chandler site who got away with everything. Always, talking trash behind others back and not professional at all. Was there longer than others but they wouldn't hire me full time. Missed a lot of time with family and kids. They want you there at work 24/7. Never again will I work for them."
bad,"work days long, usual calls at night, lot of new things to learn, lot of policitcs depending on team, not so good pay hikes.."
bad,"Osha did not apply, and when they finally listened  it was a little too late. Making people go into certain area when they were improperly."
bad,"Was hired to work for HTSI on SIAD. 50 hr work week, great. Inadequate work space, no parts, no special tools as promised. Leadership is lacking in professionalism, constant threats of job security towards everyone on site, tossing wages in everyone's faces. No opportunity for advancement if you're working for Honeywell through a sub contractor."
bad,Management is below average skill level. It was a horrible place to work. This is a company that needs to get rid of a lot of their managers.
bad,"Love my job but no longer have a future with this company.  Mismanaged, unsafe, inexperienced from top to bottom in management, but love my fellow union brothers."
bad,"Very Chaotic"
bad,They accused me of clogging the toilets but never had any proof. So they let me go for something that I never did. After I was gone the bathroom damages continued. They fired the wrong person and a good worker.
bad,"Destroyed a profitable business and moved the operation to Mexico."
bad,working for big company like Honeywell is good . the work is easy is just the management are confusing most of the time . they will give you more work but not paying you right .
bad,The company has no work/life balance. It is expected to work at nights and during weekends. Not family friendly. Micromanagement sucks. Lots of titles but no leadership! They manage employees based on fear not respect. It is normal to get yelled at and called an idiot. High number of uneducated managers that should not be in managing positions in the first place. Absolutely unprofessional environment and high turnaround. If you see posting from this company - pretend you did not see it and move on.
bad,This was a request for quote and analysis the quote job only. We did not place orders with the suppliers. Some days very busy and others not so busy.
bad,"Honeywell cares nothing for their employees.  Absolutely treats their employees  with zero respect or compassion."
bad,A lot of work and not enough hours in the day to complete. This however may not be a fair assessment although the company should spend more time acclimating employees acquired through acquisitions.
bad,"It was one of the worst experiences to work for this company. Management was horrible and people were even worse."
bad,"Was a temp job with opportunity to get hired after a year if your lucky.  Lazy people get a way with murder, and hard workers have there assignment end.  Leads were better than supervisors.  Inventory manager made a hostile work environment by yelling at you in front of people.  One of the main supervisors dont know his butt from his elbow.  Low pay.  They are more organized and now have scanners, pretty much the only con besides getting boots for 5 bucks."
bad,"They don't like different or anyone new doing better than them"
bad,"I would work ten hour days Monday through Saturday. The people were rude and did not want to do their job on time, leaving me board without work. I would pack up boxes, label them and load them into trucks."
bad,"co workers are great, Management is terrible, Have been locked out of the plant twice, laid off twice, that place could be run by monkeys the way upper management and corporate run it."
bad,If people don't like to work then get a job there making money and say no to doing your job.  The most unionized non union company that I have ever seen.
bad,They will screw you.  Do not let the $$$ amount sway you. They do not care about you or your family. Very misleading group in Chesapeake!
bad,"Not a good place to work. Management is very unprofessional and half of them don't have a clue nor possess the tools to be in leadership, money is okay but you're under paid for the work you do and the yearly raises are a joke! Only Certain people get recognized for those...Remind you this is after 6 years of employment with this company. You don't get treated fairly so why waist your time... I'm getting upset typing this. I'm just giving you a warning that I didn't have, so don't make the same mistake I did."
bad,"Very Bad Owner with bad attitude only care money."
bad,"The management at ADI a subsidiary of Honeywell, in Sparks, IS ATROCIOUS!!! The facility manager is rude disrespectful and beyond unprofessional.He uses profanity to employees and calls names. His facility has little to no training for new employees, and the work environment is very hostile. Co workers can do as they please which is unproductive and part of the problem. MOSTLY THE MANAGEMENT IS AT FAULT..FOR HIS ACTIONS & what is allowed in the work place.  NO accountability for staff."
bad,"Honeywell its a good company, but in the facility that I work at the Leadership has a lack of people skills and no school education, that creates a dead end work environment and no career growth."
bad,"Great team member to work with, high security application system operated by solid management team and support team."
bad,"Travail à la chaine ou la responsable d'ilot ne vous laisse pas le temps nécessaire pour vous accoutumer au job,plus vite toujours plus vite;au bout de 8h on est viré ."
bad,Spent more time at work than at home. Management wasn't supportive.
bad,"Good Place to work, Clean working environment. It was a really fast place environment that required me to work my full shift everyday and sometimes overtime."
bad,"I'm hopeful that I may find a more productive source of employment,that treats everyone on an equal basis."
bad,"door to door sales upselling home security systems"
bad,"A typical day is trying to figure out how to let your boss (Sr. Contracts Manager) know that what he is telling you to do, relative to  government contracts, is unethical and violates federal law and you not loose your job because of it."
bad,"This was a place to retire from. Very good pay, laid back and not physical and then they told us they were shutting down in March. But before they do we must teach the Mexicans that are taking our jobs and shipping the company to Mexico"
bad,Would never go back there and I have been offered another position there as a contractor.
bad,"This company is not very good to work, for very small not enough of employees. I learned that it's a lot of work, with 4 different Programs they're dealing with have a few temps. Work until you're tired and no-one does and full-time hiring. The management has to much power and very disrespectful to the temps, and the employees there. Most exciting thing with this job was trying, to do was celebrate everyone"
bad,had the worst experience ever. No job security. Horrible behavior of the employees and a gutless management that lacks direction
bad,I enjoy the work here.  There is a great variety of departments to learn and grow.  You come in here with a good attitude and things work itself out.
bad,Vert repetious. All I can say is I wish my position there was more stable
bad,"Instead of their slogan saying ""Do it right the first time"", the slogan should be ""Do it fast the first time,if you happen to get it right, that's okay too."
bad,"Very hostile work enviroment, cut throat company, Benifits are non exsistant, Supervisor and employees in your face all the time over the littlest things. Miserable place to work, no uniity among co-workers, the supervisor shows favortism to certain employees. The company expects you to work, work, work, with no incetives, no bonus or profit sharing."
bad,To be such a large Company there health care benifits are the worst I have ever seen. Its a shame to threated for your job everyday out there.
bad,Muy mal ambiente de trabajo por parte de gerencia es lo unico malo que tiene pero el ambiente es muy bueno
bad,"No good place to advance,They treat the employees unfairly"
bad,I couldn't tell you much about this Company other than their process of reviewing propsective job candidates stinks. There the only place I have seen that sends rejection notices in less than 24 hours for a job where I meet or exceed the job requirements. I am sure the hiring manager is unaware that many very qualified candidates are being screened out by uninformed HR Generalists.
bad,"Plant shut down and moved to Juarez Mexico, had to train them to do our jobs, it was sad to see it go it hurt"
bad,Honeywell Shipboard is a subordinate of Honeywell HTSI. It has it's own manager and recruiter and they make their own rules and policies to meet the present situation although they're supposed to fall under Human Resources policies.
bad,They are a body shop and do NOT care for any of the engineers that they do hire.
bad,"This is one of the worst positions I've ever had.  At Honeywell anyone that outranks you believes you work FOR them.  They have everyone working 100% onsite but they don't give you a permanent desk and the wifi doesn't support the population.  The offices look great inside but are misleading - as they don't want you to take advantage of the facilities.  I found that the people who are nicest are the cafeteria, Starbucks, and gym employees.  The culture is super cut throat - and unless you're willing to step on someone you won't be able to get anywhere."
bad,"Novar, Independence Oh is a terrible place to work.  Management is the worst I have seen in the last 20 years of working.  They let me go and then offered my job for $30K less.  You cannot trust management and most of your co-workers.  They are out for themselves.  Management keeps all bonuses for themselves.  They throw you a crumb.  Honeywell Novar has lost 50% of their employees and does not replace them.  They are out sourcing everything to India and Mexico.  Work there at your own risk, there is no longevity."
bad,"They were always looking at ways to outsource our jobs, didn't fully staff, so had to work way too many hours.  Software/requirements development process is very weak. Every major program is over budget and behind schedule, but they never let us change the process to improve things."
bad,This is NOT a career! I repeat ....this is not a career! No room for advancement! I would not recommend pursuing a job with this company! Please don't just rely on my word. Please do your research on this company before applying.
bad,"The Product I great, the employment was considered as just a number when I was there! I was the culture was not a good one everyone was out for themselves due to the format that was laid out by management! Safety product division only"
bad,This is one of the worst companies to work for there is.  From day 1 you are only a number.  Management is completely inexperienced and simply focused on advancing themselves rather than building a productive company.  The company continuously takes away benefits while trying to say they care about keeping employees happy.  This is a truly awful company to work for.
bad,"It doesn't matter how good you are at your job or how hard you work or help others, if you're not a favorite, you go unseen, unheard and misrepresented in the worst possible ways. Unfortunately, it appears that managers who have ""special relationships"" with certain employees promote, encourage and place them on pedestals, regardless of how little work they do, or how much time they waste holding ""garden parties"" and being ""socialites"". It's a darn dirty shame because there are some good, hard working people there who care about their jobs, and fellow employees, but they get treated like dirt. Shame, shame, shame on you Urbana."
bad,They advertised for a first shift employee. After 4 weeks told me that they wanted me to work 2nd shift. I gave up a first shift job to go there. The hours working are very important to me.
bad,"The work environment in Defense is horrible. But, if you like to be treated like garbage and won't let us do our jobs.   and have mandatory overtime, then this is the company for you.  Their method of ordering parts is atrocious.  They wait until there is 0 inventory before they order more.  There is no such thing as work flow there.  The test equipment is ancient, but if you like nostalgia with computers they still us DOS and have Dot Matrix Printers.  And, the operations manager micro-manages everything."
bad,Buford hwy location had poor management. No teamwork. Had a lot of temp agents working knowing they were never going to hire them permanent. Building was old with mold. No growth within this location.
bad,"Remote management by people who were disconnected with their employees and focused only on cost ensured loss of talent and ultimate failure."
bad,"When I was at Honeywell, they were in the process of laying people off. Saw a lot of people leaving, some that had been there 15 yrs. plus. Morale was terrible where I was at.  Not a place you want to work at."
bad,"If you take a job with Honeywell, keep your resume updated, and your eye on the door. If you are new to corporate American just coming out of college, you're the prime meat they're looking for. Take what they give you and approach the job in a completely mercenary fashion. "
bad,90% of time working in Honeywell is dealing with all different types of office politics. Company is spending money to create conflicts between departments and employees.
bad,"Toxic culture, management by fear, stressful work environment, constant lay-offs. Insurance premiums are high, office feels like a time capsule from the 1980’s."
bad,Management pick who they look out for whole place is corrupted and old the way this run things around here is RIDICULOUS and sad . DHEC needs to tour.
bad,Management  doesn't communicate well with employees. Hours can be very long on short notice. The training was  well but we got trained to do a engineer job at janitor pay
bad,"Flawed Management philosophy. The lean management philosophy may make a organization more effective in the first few years but after that it cannibalises the work force. To use a analogy the body of the industry may be a little fat in the beginning bit after years of lean management the industry body becomes emaciated and no apple to hold up,it's own weight."
bad,This was once a great company but not any longer. It’s probably the next GE based on the direction the leadership is taking. The only focus is eliminating jobs in the US and outsourcing  to low cost countries while spinning it as shareholder value.
bad,"Works as a Engineer for 2 years, After being haired, company realized i was able to preform much more then they expected. Had to manage people with 2 times the ""education"" I have yet my salary did not reflect that. In the end, I was doing the position of 3 separate people that could not preform their positions so they moved them to ""easier"" ones. They later let me go after I reveled to the HR personal that I started to have medical issues because of all the over work and added stress that was put on me. "
bad,"The place is run by fools, no one of the Management is worth following. There is room for improvement but if it cost money they won't do it. They overly focused on safety and quality takes the back seat. They use 6 sigma. That the worse system to be a QUALITY BUSINESS."
bad,You are just a number. Very low wages and not up to current standards. Poorly ran company. Company allowed others to work remotely but not all. Very unethical. They challenge you to find another job then try to keep you after the fact.
bad,"Honeywell used to be a great company, but it all changed after the merger with Allied Signal in 1999."
bad,"terrible place to work, they continue to take away benefits. Healt care cost are very high. Managers to not evaluate employees fairly. They eliminated pension"
bad,the best thing was my supervisor. he would rate it one star. the hardest part was always running out of product that we needed to do are job. i like the people i worked with they are great .
bad,"The new CEO is focused on making metrics so if that means laying people off or cutting areas of the business, he will do it despite how well the individual performs.  "
bad,"Honeywell aerospace is going though a rough patch. The Honeywell I worked at went from 300+ associates to 90ish associates in 3 years. Lots of reduction in work force, a lot of people left because of the culture. They basically want you to do your job as well as pick up the work load of 3 people. Everyone is stressed, management is a joke, HR in non-existent. I would not recommend this company, but if you apply there just know you were warned."
bad,Working there was the worst experience ever in my career. I am sorry to write it here but I was not happy there at all and the only positive thing on the job was to learn what I never want to do at all.
bad,"I was very good at my job but due to unforeseen circumstances my job was downsized. If you want a great job for a very short time, then come get this job.  If you have mouths to feed, then look elsewhere."
bad,The corporate office in Morris Plains is deceptively open.  They don't embrace collaboration even though they built the place to.  The management is super micromanaging to the point where you question your every move despite years of experience.
bad,"Management has lost their collective minds, and they do not have a clue about the business. They are driving AERO into the ground.  They use cronyism and nepotism to install wholly incompetent people into jobs they have no business being in."
bad,"Work culture is not that health environment for individual growth who is willing to make long stay here. After long hours of work in a week and good performance employees are not appreciated and recognized in the team. Unethical managers, play worst politics with the next subordinate in the structure."
bad,"I prefer to keep my comments about Honeywell to myself. My mother  taught me that if I have nothing nice to say about someone, then I should say nothing at all."
bad,Union job pits employees against employer. no performance raises.after 1.5 years i was making the same amount as someone there 20 years.Not allowed to increase performance above anyone else or other  employees would harass you. Performance based on lowest common denominator.
bad,"The absolute worse on govt contract jobs. Underbidding killed pay raise and performance reviews.  Supervision was terrible worse I have ever experienced in 30 years.  Untrained supervisors are just super techs with little supervisory skills.  Contract jumpers jumping from one contractor to another on the same contract, clog up the system with the same bad practices from the last contractor are passed on to the current contractor. Favoritism and nepotism are rampant."
bad,"Honeywell has had significant changes.  Any time there are changes within an organization, employees will be concerned.  Management has provided fun activities to foster cooperation."
bad,"Unreasonable expectations, set up to fail from the outset. Management sever the relationship under the pretence of “performance issues” simply because the face does not fit – make way for former colleagues with whom they have a previous business relationship.'"
bad,furloughs and layoffs where every couple of months.  No job security and management expected the people left to continue to do the work of the people who got RIF.
bad,Pagan muy poco no hay oportunidad de crecimiento y los jefes son un poco mediocres al tomar deciciones
bad,"There are zero opportunities for growth. Leadership does not respect the employees enough to communicate regularly about the future of the company. Furloughs and Layoffs are announced via email with no warning and no explanation. Leadership actively discourages employees from pursuing higher education and denies applications for tuition reimbursement out of hand. Mandatory unpaid overtime has been enacted 3 times in the 3.5 years that I've worked here, twice following a mandatory furlough. Yearly merit raises have been cancelled twice, despite record high stock prices. Medical plans have all been converted to catastrophic only plans with high deductibles. Company 401k match is at an all time low compared to the industry average."
bad,"This place where I have spent most of my work career is no longer the fun and caring place it once was. Supervision, as I see it, has taken the human factor out of what was once a great place."
bad,"The chemicals division of Honeywell is far behind the standards that you'll find in other large chemical and oil companies. If you're looking to be trained and stay on the leading edge as an engineer this is not the company for you. There are good people in any company, but a bad culture will trump that any day."
bad,"If you want job security, this is not the company to work for. I have had a bad experience with Honeywell since I started. "
bad,"Problem after problem.  Chronically behind to customers  Chronically unable to produce.  Suppliers are not well developed.  Talent level is thin.  Very silo'd company.  Very ""check the box"" run company.  Lots of moving pieces.  The different departments do not work well with each other.  Very complicated procedures that are not followed.  If there is a way to make things worse or make them more complicated, that is the way it will be done.  Then management wonders why the results are so poor."
bad,Company never gave me raises or advanced in the whole time I worked there. They showed favoritism of certain people and they never took employee's complaints seriously because the person that wasn't being fair can do whatever they want without repercussions.
bad,I have never worked for a more horrible company than this one. They treat there employees like cattle and blame employees for management's mistakes. Worst employer in America.
bad,"I did not work with honeywell very long so i cant review them aswell as a long term member of staff can, however from my experience there i can truthfully state that."
bad,There is no attention to detail and the quality does not seem to be important. Management does not seem to have any idea what they're doing.
bad,was the clean up crew on 2nd shift that the 1 st shift didn't get done.  i learn that how a big co like honywell  don't know how to run a co. and the setup of the warehouse is bad.  the groveport warehouse have  new  forklift and don't have scanner  so you have to do evething on paper and grovecity have old forklift and have scanner. 
bad,Safety review everyday and scheduled job duties
bad,"The Tucson Honeywell site is a disaster, the engineering workforce is composed of College new hires, that Honeywell does not bother to train, and Engineers that are 60+ years old and waiting to retire.  The site was designed for 3000 people and their is less than 450 people left."
bad,If you like a fear driven culture then this is the place for you.  The lack of respect for women is pathetic - it’s like you’re in a bad episode of Mad Men.  Don’t come here if you want to feel treated like a human being - it doesn’t exist here.  Morale is awful - you can sense it the minute you walk into the building.  The absolute worst company I’ve ever worked for and I was pre-warned.  Watch your back and lousy benefits
bad,"Aerospace culture stuck in the early 90’s. Rampant cronyism, zero work life balance, poor leadership, miserable employees, and very little innovation. A distant five out of five in their competitive peer group, yet their management spins buzzword filled propaganda about how great they are. No excellence other than cost savings, no long term strategy, and no stability."
bad,"Cooperate ran, poor management, policies change every day, lots of grey areas so that way they can do whatever they want to you and get away with it. They do care about your safety. That’s about it and I’m sure that’s just to protect them."
bad,"No staff meeting whatsoever. Processes are undocumented but kept in the heads of a few who are rude."
bad,"Since Honeywell took over there has been a lot of changes but not for the good . Intelligrated use to be a business that was thriving and you knew that you have job tomorrow . The new managment came In and not layoff are more ,the stress level is up and you do not if you will have a job anymore. This is not a good company to work for ."
bad,Spent 4 years at that job with the promise of advancement.  I had to get another job for them to even consider converting me from temp to full time. If you are not salary you are just a number and mean nothing. They refuse to do random drug tests. And i have personally found meth in the bathrooms..reported it..and they did nothing about it. Would never work for that company again.
bad,"Safety was only a concern if you worked with HF ( hydrogenflouride). The other chemicals not so much.  When you're new don't expect the best greeting from the people who have been there 5+ years nor getting trained in the unit by someone competent.  More like, ""Hey here ya go"" attitude is given. The turnover rate speaks for itself."
bad,"Started off a good place to work. Really bad management ruined this plant. They do absolutely nothing for employees or morale. Revolving door once people see the culture. New hires training new hires, supervision and managers are unreliable and quick to blame operations or set you up to fail. High paid laborers, no area ownership, no team culture, employee harassment, targeting, and blind eye politics."
bad,"Honeywell expects a lot (too much) from it's employees.  For a salaried employee, There is an expectation that an employee works as many hours as it takes to achieve acceptable results.  This can and will result in 50-60 hour work weeks, with little to no recognition of the sacrifice of time away from work."
bad,"Full politics and self relative, friends and college people are hired but they never hire outside people even they hire they will not let them to stay for long time ...job risk is too high"
bad,Good employees but poor work system and management. Horrible horrible horrible  management but good trainers and a very great experience with machining
bad,"During my employment with Honeywell Building Solutions, I was based at Liverpool 1, as a static Fire Engineer, during that time I was exposed to  Bad behaviors in the workplace that effected morale and productivity. "
bad,"Malos tratos, no aportan conocimiento para realizar el trabajo, es sentate y hacelo. Como, con que, de que manera? Arreglaste solo. Ninguno de los jefes sabe hacer el trabajo, uno va tomando conocimiento equivocadose. Lo bueno es que si te equivocas por ejemplo en un pedido de 20 mil medidores de energía eléctrica ya entregados al cliente y vuelven, no te hacen responsable porque saben que nadie, ni los jefes, ni los ingenieros ni los de calidad saben como se hacen los trabajos. Asimismos el problema y arrancamos de nuevo. No pagan precentismo, no pagan viaticos, no dan prepio de producción, no dan franco compensatorios cuando se trabaja un franco al margen de que así lo exige el cct. Las charlas diarias que se realizan antes de casa jornada no son claras porque no saben lo que están leyendo en las filminas. Nos hacen leer cada párrafo al azar y la interpretación es la que vos quieras porque ellos no saben entonces es si entendíeron bien y sino vemos a los largo de los días trabajando. No dan curso de primeros auxilio siendo que trabajamos con 220 ⚡ no hay matafuegos, no hay limpia lentes, no hay herramientas. Somos más de 180 empleados y a la hora del almuerzo solo hay 2 microondas para calentar la comida. Sueldo aprox $8 mil y bajando por quincena."
bad,Would never recommend employment at this company.  Was the worst work experience I have experienced this far.  I highly suggest another company relative to government contracting.
bad,Total management hellhole. Zero competent leadership and management will leave you out on an island to die. No respect for personal time. Perfect place if you're a middle manager who loves the sound of their own voice and getting upset with employees you don't define requirements for.
bad,"Once a great company focused on employee development and continuous improvement.   Now a company focused on short term profits and spinning communications as to why the new ""Re-Engineered"" Honeywell Operating System failed while the best employees are leaving in droves."
bad,"Honeywell Management has no idea what each market segment of their business is actually doing so they have continuous meetings and large amounts of reporting on a daily basis so they can appear like they actually understand what is going on in each business segment.  A lot of the reporting and meetings are repetitive and a waste of good customer Face time.  Much of this could have been replaced with a simple email.  "
bad,No advancement or pay raises available. Managers dictate and dont listen. Blame goes around along with poor coworker unhappiness. I wanted a year of my life there.
bad,"Honeywell is really good about protecting their own interests at the expense of the employees. The no-retaliation policy is a joke, as it was shortly after making an ethics complaint that a lay off for ""performance issues"" was executed. The culture is lost on many layers of bureaucratic management that make it difficult to stay competitive with the industry. This is evident through the amount of turnover within the region in the previous 36 months."
bad,"Worked with some wonderful people but, the business was in constant turmoil. Many people stayed in jobs 18 - 24 months and then changed positions within the company or left. Very reactive as a whole - always under pressure to do more and cover for the lack in other divisions that may be missing targets. Very hard to have work/life balance at Honeywell."
bad,"If you're a robot who has no common sense, lacks basic human emotion and has no ethics then this is the company for you. I have been in my profession for over 15 years and no amount of experience can prepare your this company. The Idea of safety is very important until push comes to shove and it will cost them time or money and they will ask you to do the most rediculous things. Forget any support from management as they are so overwhelmed they don't know if they are coming or going and say goodbye to your family as you will never enjoy a moment with them as you are expected to be available 365 days a year. One of our managers had to attend funeral for a family member half way around the world and was asked to keep their phone on them to respond to calls."
bad,"Managers, are non caring, and most don't know what their employees do"
bad,Poor culture and training.  Not a good place to work at all.  No respect for employees. Hostile work environment between Management and employees.  No respect among the employees and management
bad,"I did the job of three people....worked 10 to 12 hrs a day...expected me to work weekends and bring work home...everything was never enough...when I left, they hired two people to do my job...it was a joke....I almost lost my marriage"
bad,"Think before you get in here. so many changes every week/month, poor management, nepotism with a high degree outsourcing. Losing jobs to low wage in the US."
bad,"Organization is too siloed to be effective or efficient. Majority of time spent on useless, avoidable tasks. Woefully understaffed. No work life balance. No opportunities for career development. Lots of training available, but not job pertinent enough to be useful. Glass ceiling, Evaluation system too complex so seriously abused and meaningless. Terrible management. No value placed on what employees do or have to offer and absolutely no job security."
bad,"It was a back biting, gossipy type of place.  Insrance was terrible and everyone there complained for hours on end. It takes months to get trained you may or may not get to work."
bad,"You have no life, you are at their mercy and beck & call. Too many people are on their 3rd marriage working there because of the time demands. NOT a place for a person with a family. The management talks down and berates you simply because they can and believe you are under them. Other employees that have been there longer, believe they can talk to you any kind of way, because they have more seniority than you, but you all make the exact same amount across the board."
bad,"Honeywell does not honor contracts, implementing all kinds of hoops for buyers to jump through to be able to adhere to contract terms with suppliers.  Low employee morale.  High turnover.  Lousy health insurance (cheaper to pay cash than use insurance).  They pitch unlimited vacation when they interview and then say it's at management's discretion after you're hired, but at least half the employees rarely take vacation because we are so understaffed that it makes it very stressful to be away for more than an occasional day.  Oftentimes, we work while we are on vacation, so vacation is more like ""work from home"".  Management makes us chase metrics and report out of so many unnecessary things that we can't do our core job, which leads to more disconnects.  It's very poorly managed, with systems and processes that are in dire need of an overhaul.  A large portion of the employees treat us like we are worthless and positive gains with our suppliers are never good enough.  They have meetings galore and want a meeting scheduled every time there is a disconnect, which is another reason why we can't do our core job to keep supply from becoming disconnected."
bad,The best part of working at Honeywell are the coworkers they are helpful and hardworking. Most will come to your aid even outside of work. They are a great bunch of people to work with.
bad,"Required to work 10 to 12 hours a day, 7 days a week for months at a time. Punished for getting sick due to excessive work hours in unbearable heat. Toxic chemicals constanly in my face and exposed asbestos in the ceiling."
bad,Discriminates based on race. Doesn't promote people who work hard.  You can be the best at your job but they'll overlook that and promote the other guy because of his ethnicity. Management lets people get away with slacking off while other have to pick up the slack. Very unfair work environment.
bad,"Although you can opt for benefits, the cost is outrageous.  For being a huge company, they don't treat their employees well.  The employees were not happy at all working there."
bad,"Honeywell does not offer any job security.  Layoffs are part of the culture.  The only thing that matters to Honeywell is the stock price.  The culture is to expect employees to work nights and weekends, but there is no loyalty from the company back to the employee."
bad,"50 min. working 9hr and 10 min trying to keep your job"
bad,"The HBS division has been going through reorganization numerous times in the last 5-6 years and each year losing valuable experienced personnel. They no longer care about the employees, they are just trying to make the division look profitable so they can sell it. This is the division of Honeywell that Honeywell was originally created from. This is the division that everyone thins of Honeywell as, but soon it will no longer be that way."
bad,"You see benefits erode every year in addition to layoffs and attrition, yet the stock price keeps going up. The upper management finds ways to pad the profit by taking away benefits from the employees."
bad,The culture in the office was very dramatic and often gossip laden. People were also quick to throw others under the bus instead of helping them and the general attitude was horrible.
bad,"Hostile work environment. Was harassed by multiple people. Rumor mill, If your not liked or accepted then they will force you out. If you are female then the male managers will advance your position"
bad,I worked in a department that the golf tournament was #1 priority and attending meetings was #2 priority.  Very little work was getting done and I continuously reported to management what needed to be done before I could move to the next step.  Management cared very little about project success they cared more about having meetings to talk about themselves and their likes and dislikes.  The culture has changed greatly that romper room takes priority over getting work done.  Biggest waste of tax payers money!!!!  Two thumbs down from me.
bad,"Great workforce, however too many senior leaders / directors who don't know their people and and only care about the bottom dollar or metrics. The 9 block review system is not fair when site leadership force people in the bottom half of the grading system based on inputs from upper management."
bad,stay busy all the time... I have learned very little management is a joke...not room to advance .... its hot and dirty.. we get a free lunch occasially
bad,"Bad senior leadership"
bad,Command and Control management where you fear for your job / career on a daily basis.   They do layoffs all the time and even when they always toot record profits.   Benefits are little to none and they keep decreasing them.   This business is struggling with to many VP's and not enough workers.
bad,I've been working for them for a month and still no direct deposit.  I emailed CMI and nothing.  I tried calling with no return call.  Obviously I was scammed and won't return to work there.  Lesson to be learned: Never work for some outside agency.
bad,"Pro's - Job dependent flexibility for sick, leave and vacation time. Many individual contributors are great people to work with. "
bad,"Management prefers to hire certain ethnicities. They prefer to keep low pay employees and get rid of those costing them too much, even if they are qualified. Unless you grew up in the company, that is. The ""old school"" employees treat the new employees horribly."
bad,Honeywell Greer  was a good company to work for but the management is very bad now.  Theres no room for advancement for majority of the workforce. The employees moral is very low.
bad,"There is no worklife balance."
bad,"Balance of work/life was excellent"
bad,"No procedures or process on how to do things, they just make up things as they go. Manager is very hands off, not in tuned with what the dept is doing. No opportunity for advancement."
bad,I answered all incoming sales calls and gave the calls to their specific salesperson. I counted the cash drawer at the end of the day. I also ordered office and kitchen supplies. If for some reason one of the copiers or printers jammed or didn't work one of the sales people would call me. I usually could fix them. i worked with 6 guys and at times that could be very demanding. When a customer came in with alarm equipment that wasn't working i did the paperwork and sent the item to the vendor for repair. I followed through to make sure the repair got returned to the customer as soon as possible. The enjoyable part of that was the Thank You. That goes along way with me.
bad,The company has a new policy that will take away vacation time AND make people work for free. They are making whole departments work more hours to make up for vacation time taken off by any employee in that department. That means we are basically paying for our own vacation time. Or in a way we are paying for others vacation with our own personal time. Managers have to force us to work more hours for free. There are no bonuses to justify this policy. Pay is low.
bad,Worst company I've ever worked for. Poor management and communication practices   drove me to leave after only a year. Watch your payroll. They will attempt to rip you off constantly.
bad,"After four years I found myself decimated by the infighting and back stabbing politics.  It's easy to lose your mojo in this environment, and hard to get it back.  Keep your sanity and find another company to work for that will respect your contribution."
bad,"Yes, they have mechanical engineers writing LabVIEW software! As you might expect, they don't observe the RULES of good software development or do a good job at it. They REFUSE to put comments in their code for example!"
bad,No room for advancement they dont back fill jobs so you are overwhelmed by working multiple projects. Management doesn't care about you only themselves
bad,"USA vetoinen sivu tmsto, todella vaikeasti ylitettävä byrokratiaa"
bad,"Poor life/work balance. Pay never seemed to add up correctly. (This review should not be a required 150 characters, ridiculous on the websites behalf.)"
bad,"Honestly the most enjoyable time is, leaving at the end of the shift. Lots of lazy people, some will help you, most will not. Advisement forget it, they just gave a supervisor position to someone off the floor who hit another employee on the head with his hard hat. That should tell you all you need to know."
bad,Upper management does not value employees. Those in the upper positions don't care if employees are happy or not. They only care about the bottom line.
bad,"Not a good place to work. poor management. Thing's you do is good, but communication it sucks. Could be better but management doesn't have time for you until they want something."
bad,I want to get out before it is too late. It is getting to stressful wondering what will happen next. From day to day you don't know how many hours you will work before they send you home.
bad,"As many before me have said - it's really just a toxic and unfriendly environment with management choosing their favorites (usually someone with a contract so it's not that easy to let them go) and take a huge dump all over everyone else. Job is not secure, they can say goodbye to you any day but they will make you work that day and tell you by the end of it that's you're out of job for most silliest and unreasonable reasons. All it takes is one or two lies from a team leader who doesn't like you and suddenly you're out of job because it's your word against your team leaders word. They constantly make stupid rules up, don't tell you about them for a year and then suddenly they tell you that you should do this or that and that it's always been like that even though it's literally the first time you hear about it. They don't ask any questions, just fire you. They don't care what really happened, they make up their own stories to back up their decision and that's it. The atmosphere is simply toxic - you're surrounded by people who aim to write as many reports on you as possible, staring at you and waiting for your mistake so they can go straight to your supervisor. The whole system of kaizens and observations is sick to its core as they don't really seem to care about pure communication, all it takes is an observation written on a computer and theres no way of verifying it whether it's true or not. They set unrealistic targets for the team and expect to do it, they pressure the team to do crazy amounts of overtime while saying how sorry they are and they are working to fix it."
bad,"Honeywell has a culture of fear.  Folks want step up, point out issues or acknowledge short comings. Why? You get fired quickly for pointing this out and if you are the cause that is pointed out, even worse. "
bad,"Terrible place to work.    Too many hours,  zero support from hr or the company.   Worked like a dog without any recognition.    Bad, unhealthy place to work"
bad,Poor management. Ready for more diversity and women in Tech. This company puts on a big front about equal opportunities. Security Clearance takes a very long time. Creates a feeling of worthlessness and unable to do your job for almost 2 years or more for some.
bad,"You have to know someone, or par of the family. Also they give more opportunities to Mayaguez graduates. If you want to grow this is not the place. Run"
bad,Honeywell would be infinitely more successful if they hired managers who were actually competent and well versed in the industry of whatever department they manage.  It's pathetic.  If I were a client of Honeywell and knew what was going on behind the scenes I'd be furious over the amount of money being wasting because management simply doesn't know what the heck is going on.  They are more interested in having conference calls than they are of getting familiar with the work the employees in their department are doing.  How can you be of help to an employee as a manager when you literally don't have the slightest clue how to answer any of the questions the employees underneath you have?  Working here was a pathetic experience.  When I was hired someone told me I probably wouldn't last because I was too competent and apparently that threatens management to the degree that they'd rather let the person go (because they make the manager look as stupid as they are) than harness their intelligence to move the department forward.  I  was warned from day 1.
bad,Ever changing org makes it difficult to know what to do. Complete lack of leadership and 100% responsibility when things go wrong. Impossible environment to be successful in any role.
bad,Moved are assembly to mexico seems to be new business plan. Make you work mandatory 10 hrs and Saturdays. Work life balance is non existent. No advancement opportunities.
bad,"You work there only as a contractor from 6 months to 1 year. Then you are released. You must be off of work for 6 months before you can return or  are considered to work as a contractor for another 6 month to a year, again. with no future of no being hired.  "
bad,"This company is so terrible. The finance leadership is all about filling out forms and checking the box. Not actually running a business. The cronyism amongst senior leadership is a cancer. "
bad,"The pay is good at Honeywell if you can hold onto your job. The average tenure was roughly 1.5 years in 2018. Poor corporate strategies would lead to unproductive teams and unsatisfied clients, and people would be let go. A new team would then be hired and the process would repeat itself. There are different divisions at Honeywell. I am referring to Honeywell Building Solutions."
bad,morristown doesnt know the truth about what goes on in Phoenix...Many fraudulent managers at honeywell by Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix. Many activities that are very questionable in the aerospace sector especially the Phoenix site.
bad,"I worked as a senior leader at the Fort Mill South Carolina facility.  The culkture was one of blaming the employees for systems and process that were in place and did not work.  Employees were held to deliver projects within a short timeframe and the system, processes and bandwidth do not exist to support these goals and when a project misses the delivery date or slips employees were put on performance improvement plans.    I am glad that we came to a mutual agreement and I moved on, it was the best thing for me and my health ."
bad,"A typical day at Honeywell is packed with meetings. There's no time for focused work. Most employees arrive early, leave late and work from home. Working from home in the evenings seems to be an expectation; although working from home during business hours is frowned upon. Of the 5 major corporations I've worked for, Honeywell is the worst."
bad,"After the merger with the other division they moved in their management and got rid of every one that knew anything about the core sensing and control business, so very sad."
bad,Day to day test brakes.  Learned how to test brakes.  Management was bad.  Workplace culture nepotism.  Hardest part know who not cross.  The most enjoyable part was the work.
bad,"Bad management, uncomfortable workplace. No work/life balance and no job advancement. Lack of communication and poor teamwork. I do not recommend working for them on the Die Casting division"
bad,The management did not care about any of the employees and actually acting like employees that were not in management were lowlifes beneath them. I was involved in many conversations with others in management on my level as well as upper management and it was terrible the lack of respect for others that they had.
bad,"I worked at Honeywell for a little under 3 years. In that time I was shuffled around to 4-5 different products, never given a chance to establish myself in one. Upper management makes decisions without consulting individuals in the business groups that know the customers and business well. Cut throat management attitude makes progressing with products challenging, and not in a fun good way. Getting ANYTHING done takes Herculean efforts and politics."
bad,no incentive to work there.  no-one communicates.  Too much inexperienced management.  Long work weeks with no incentive.  Too much conflict between departments and shifts.  A very horrible environment for a company to be successful.
bad,"The cost plus government contract provided no incentive and no reward for hard work. The bloated work force was populated with subject matter under/uneducated politically correct persons whose primary goal was to find a vacant higher position, and their secondary goal was not to ruffle, read question or disagree with, the government contract officer. To a technical employee, spending three days on studying the most efficient placement of a trash can in a cubicle farm to earn six sigma certification is worthless. And, to force an employee to use vacation days to attend simulation tool training seminars is insulting."
bad,"Very hard to learn how Honeywell does anything when everyone at the company will tell you that the ""Training is awful and I'm too busy to help"" Everyone tells you anytime you need something let me know but the truth is they would rather not and too busy."
bad,Everyone only cares about themselves and would step on anyone to get ahead. I am being forced to put in more info on this and so this part is just filler
bad,"all tho the pay is good the work place and management is not."
bad,Here is the American dream as viewed by the corporate greed. The workers need to do more with less resources. Honeywell has become more and more about profiting than creating a culture where they take care of their employees. They like for to bounce from one area to another because they cannot find a way to hire more employees. Management does understand what is going on in the area.
bad,"Worked here for a few months and all i can say is just how terrible this company is. Horrible benefits, you have to meet a 1,500 dollar deductible even before your benefits kicking in. Also, they recently got rid of the work from home policy. And lastly when i came on board they train you for a few weeks (2 in my case) and expect you to have it all down pat. I laughed my way out of this crazy company and haven't looked back since. Also low morale overall due to layoffs and very high work expectations. Also expecting you to work from home after hours and after getting rid of the work from home policy. HA no thanks."
bad,"Honeywell used to be a good place to work, but the direction for US workers has been on the decline for the last couple years.  Constant RIFs and threats of furloughs.  No raises.  Benefits are very expensive with no company assistance with dental plan.  Working remotely has been pretty much banned even though 75% of the teams are overseas."
bad,"No hubo mucho que aprender, ya que esta administración carecía de apoyo para el crecimiento profesional y personal, mi certificación fue lograda por decisión propia."
bad,"although the hourly wage is quite comparable, the lack of care and concern for employees and customers alike are alarming. anything and everything allowed...mandatory time off without pay to make bonuses for management. customer needs not being met due to lack of managements ability to keep  materials and machinery in working order"
bad,Very poor management with no clue what the dept. does. There is no communication. I believe they want everyone to quit so they can hire people from India.
bad,"I joined a fairly new team (younger than a year) and within the 1st couple months both mobile Team Leads left citing poor management from the middle-managers. The management is lacking vision and are shooting in the dark. The team isn't very demotivated at this point while working with archaic technologies. Needless to say the code-base is horrendous and there is no willingness to move away from it. "
bad,"Very technical, highly skilled workplace.  Management does not utilize resources or employee skills and does not take constructive criticism whatsoever, even when its sole purpose is to improve workplace conditions and increase profits."
bad,"Honeywell is like joining a cult. If you follow orders, don't question authority, and think like everyone else you will get along fine. ""I'm too busy"" is the mantra here. Everyone talks about overflowing email and constant meetings. If you subscribe to work smarter not harder you will not fit in. They love bureaucracy and red tape. They live for taking simplicity and making it difficult. You constantly have to justify everything you do and constantly have to CYA. I spend more time CYA than I do working."
bad,"Worse place I've ever worked. Wages are good, but atmosphere is negative, and no job security."
bad,"I worked at both the Redmond and Albuquerque locations as a contract engineer.  In 33 years of consulting/contracting, this was the lousiest company I ever dealt with, hands down.  I won't bore with details, but the only good thing I can say about Honeywell is that they treat their contractors no worse than they do their employees.  Which, unfortunately, is like garbage.  "
bad,bad company to work with. I dont recommend honeywell technology solutions to anyone
bad,"Honeywell runs their employees in the ground. They push higher and higher goals with little support or resource to achieve the goal. It is best to steer clear of this company because they will hurt you physically, mentally and emotionally with their fake support."
bad,plant manager was a Tyrant! She was under the control of the Engineering Manager who made her decisions for her.
bad,Where careers go to die.  DO NOT WORK HERE!  You will eventually want to cut yourself and bleed out. Very bad culture to work in and top management is terrible
bad,"the good:"
bad,Culture is in grown.  Nepotism is rampant.  Mgmt continues to change but nothing changes. There continues to be bias based on cliques. It's high school for adults less about work & more about who your family or person you align yourself.  It's not a good environment.
bad,"Honeywell is not particularly supportive of its workforce. Decisions that affect and impact employees at the local site are made elsewhere. Most people are reporting to managers who are off-site so those who are making decisions are disconnected from the local site which probably explains why there have been so many RIFs."
bad,"The employees up stream communications stopped at the team leader and it never reached beyond that. Issues that were reported wouldn't be resolved. Favoritism was very apparent and foreign languages would be used to talk down on employees knowing that they understand. Work environment has room for improvement. Employees tend to leave, not due to the company, but rather because of the poor leadership."
bad,"No accountability by anyone.  Cannot accomplish your job due to lack of continuity both in management and peers.  Union runs the place.  "
bad,"They talk about advancing and retaining good employees, but they don't. You need to be someone's friend, girlfriend or mom to get promoted at this place. Morale is non-existent."
bad,"Severely lacking a collaborative work environment."
bad,"Disappointed that when they took over BW Tech, promised that they would keep the local business going.  Within a few years it was more important to get rid of local workers and make higher profits by moving local jobs to low paying jobs in Mexico, India and Korea."
bad,They only care about their full time employees. Temp people don't matter. They say they'll hire u in 90 days and they won't. They lie. The environment is cool but they only hire who they want. I was pregnant expecting to come back and they lied and said they filled my position
bad,"Receiving parts from vendors , bar code and stocking the parts pulling batch orders and stocking them back, forklift operation unload all incoming freight trailers,united parcel service, federal express, airborne."
bad,"Morale, culture and benefits are all terrible but they pay you well in hopes of keeping you. For me, it was too bad to stay. They have a “no work from home” policy that applies to the general work day. However, it is very much expected for you to continue working at home for a few more hours at least and on the weekends. "
bad,not a good place to work right out of college . if you alot of hours and dont care to advance in this company then you can work here. if you are not looking for advancement look elsewhere. the work environment is very hostile so if you like this kind of space and environent then you will fit in perfectly.
bad,"I was temp getting ready to be hired on , i did my hire on background check  it came back good and all , I was training other temps when they came in the door , all of a sudden I get a phone called and was the only temp laid off and had been there 2 months without missing  a day or being late , no write ups or anything but they kept the people that just started 1 week ago that I trained stated to me that business was slow and had limited work so I was the only one to go , sounds pretty strange to me ."
bad,I did not have a good experience with Honeywell. They drove employees away and did not at all respect any type of work/life balance. I would not recommend working for them.
bad,"Honeywell badges itself as the leader in industrial IOT. In reality it is just another large corporation with a lot of politics and little software savvy. In short, it is the place you go when you are tired of writing software and want to take a cozy management track position with meetings and email all day."
bad,"Great teams to work with and immediate management is superb. When you get to upper management, the decision making skills leave many shaking their heads."
bad,They need new management that can treat employees with respect and equal. They degrade and harass employees they dont get along with.  Employees are always waiting on parts to be productive. Most people are hard working but not compensated or acknowledged for what they do.  The work hours are good.
bad,"Honeywell cares about money. They value shareholder and executive wealth above everything else. As an example, they moved a manufacturing site from the USA to Mexico when they knew the lower Quality Failure rates of products would mean their life-safety equipment would cause customer fatalities. They calculated the annual savings related to moving the site, and since savings was higher than potential litigation due to fatalities, they decided to move the site to Mexico. Money matters most at Honeywell."
bad,"el ambiente fatal falso RH el peor , la planta del florido da pena"
bad,"If you are in the click, you got it made. If not be prepared to get the undesirable assignments and schedule. They will work a good horse to death. They mistreat the hourly workers too. They are equal opportunity mistreaters."
bad,"A perpetual revolving door for what passes as branch management. The people that rotate through the two or three management positions are typically corporate ladder climbers and are more concerned with corporate matrixs than actually digging into branch problems and fixing them. I have never worked for a more disconnected organization as it relates to Management and Field Operations. Sterile, superficial attention to project processes, and lack of actual knowledge of our industry is killing this sector of Honeywell. They are just way too big to give a care for the people that actually make the industry a career. A clear example of the relation between the Deep State and Political Administrations."
bad,"Gave half our work to Mexico and didn't do anything to make it up or even let go of the temps so there were more Indians than work so consequently work time there was SLOW. The Chiefs had no idea what was going on and the ""talk"" of moving was tabled until further notice."
bad,"I was under appreciated by My co-workerz, they took advantage of me, because I was a Temp., I was alwayz asked, to do them favorz!!! I asked to be transfered, because of the way they were, & it never happened!!!"
bad,"very bad culture, hard to work with management, you don't get help when needed, unreasonable deadlines, needed more people on projects, most of management should have already retired, mean age in dept, was 67"
bad,Terrible place to work; overtime is mandatory; no family time; work every weekend; benefits are terrible; told you can't use your vacation time; Honeywell isn't paying their bills so running out of parts all the time
bad,"It's pretty much the same day in to day out. Sales are down, we need to save millions,even though Honeywell as a whole is worth $38 billion. The future sales are looking bleak. No sunshine or love what so ever. The incredible turnover rate at this facility should get the attention of higher ups and the general public. Granted, Honeywell has spent millions at Metropolis PMT to get it to 5-S standards. You can apply lipstick on a pig, and it's still a pig. It's a very old and dirty facility. I've learned hard work means absolutely nothing to management and the numbers game is everything. The culture is toxic, dark as if we are attending a funeral. Depression is sure to set in as you make your way across the parking lot to clock in and take your daily/nightly dose of morale breaking. The jobs themselves are not difficult, you get quick training, but don't expect a ""one big family"" atmosphere! The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers and the time we get off away from here. Benefits are non existent are are projected to get worse. This place is a good resume builder and that's where it ends. If your considering employment here and already have a stable job, seek out and ask a current or former employee. Ask about working here and then take their advice. There has been 2 lockouts and a layoff in a five year period, it's very unstable. When the HR department has to have meetings on ""Morale building"" and get confused on how to encourage/motivate employees, you know what I mean?"
bad,"Honeywell provides a good work/life balance with flexible hours but has structural shortcomings that cause pathetic morale, abysmal culture, and zero faith in the long term success of the company.  There are no promotions; employees must apply for a different position to advance their career.  Traditional health benefits have been replaced with ""benefits"" that require significant investment from each employee (it cost me $15K to have a child 3 years ago and $17K to have a child last year).  Not recommended for people who want to start (or sustain) a family.  The facilities are >50 years old with zero updates or remodeling (except repairs to fix the leaking roof last summer).  There are also vermin and pest traps inside and outside the facility.  Employee turn over is a constant issue for both engineering and manufacturing.  Honeywell decision authority is solely maintained in senior management circles in Phoenix AZ, making autonomous operation at other sites impossible.  Three week-long furloughs (unpaid leave) from December 2015 to September 2016.  Two layoffs in 2016.  No pay raise in 2016.  All incentive plans (bonuses) cut 50% in 2016 from previous levels and told this is the new standard going forward.  Summary: zero faith in long term success of the company."
bad,Very little support for new employees.  Most employees are 20 year employees that are reluctant to personalize with new employees because retention is very low.
bad,"Please note that this review is for HTSI in Colorado Springs only. HTSI COS is a government contract for Air Force Satellite Control Network. First of all, there is solid opportunity to learn highly technical skills and there is some opportunity for advancement. I am in awe of the ability of some of my co-workers. But Benefits are the worst I have ever seen. Our HR is a nightmare of favoritism, sneery/superior behaviors, and insecurity. you cannot get fair treatment with this present group, even with documentation. People are very unhappy here as a general rule; gossip and backstabbing run rampant. It's unreal. I have been unable to figure out why this place seems to breed so much gossip. HTSI-COS tends to hire bad managers, too. Some goods ones really try to hold it together but many are unprepared for any kind of serious responsibility, as they are engineers who became managers and have no training in leadership. Engineers are like living, breathing Flat Stanleys here. Job security is pretty low and the contract will be up soon, which will send everyone scrambling for jobs. Everyone I talk to is looking for another job. Doesn't that alone tell you something?"
bad,"Management Sucks! Once you have left the Jacksonville area, you are forgotten about by the management."
bad,Honeywell is moving all corporate employees to North Carolina. The compliance department is de-emphasized in favor of savings. Many employees are getting laid off if they cannot move.
bad,Horrible place to work it who you know not what.  The tech director loves woman and if you say no he picks on you.  They never give you a chance to  explain. Hr always give you false hopes and lie
bad,This company holds no future for employees. Management does not resolve critical issues such as workplace harassment. It is a very toxic atmosphere that stems from poor management. They treat you as a number and when you are asked who you are you refer to your number not your name.
bad,Everyone I knew at the company and was truly good at their jobs left as soon as the 2-year employment contracts expired.  Management and outdated mentalities prevent capable people from excelling and improving quality/profitability.
bad,"I was hired in the position after working as a contractor for 8 months .   My first manager knew little about procurement and was promoted to a Director of Procurement even though all but 2 of the 8 buyers on his team went collectively to HR to complain about his management practices and he the fact he belittled us and had no leadership skills kept his office door shut, didn’t want to be cc’d on procurement issues and couldn’t provide solutions for work issues.   HR launched an investigation and months later and never bothered to follow up with us or give us any information on the outcome of our complaint when asked. Our requests to HR went unanswered.  My second manager had  previously been the Purchasing manager and had worked in compliance for several years before returning.  The time working as the compliance manager made procurements compliance focued rather than Fulfillment focused.  Orders became  gridlocked in compliance which rarely approved the purchase orders.  "
bad,The Olathe Kansas facility is a difficult place to work. It is understaffed to the point of causing employee stress. Production associates are asked repetedly to work weekends and holidays. It is expected by senior management.
bad,"Zero leadership and teamwork.  Poor planning of work, cut throat and biased yearly evaluations.  Little room for growth if you don’t fit in.  Excellent company globally, not locally"
bad,"One of the worst jobs I've ever had. I dreaded going to work each day. I was excited to work there and things went well the first year. However, new management took over and layoffs began and the atmosphere changed. I would not recommend this place of employment to my worst enemy."
bad,Overall a bad unappreciative place to work.  The GM prefers to accomplish tasks in the most inefficient manner possible and cost the company money in the process..
bad,It is definitely not a great place to work for someone with dreams and aspirations to achieve something big in life. Work is extremely monotonous and very poor compensation with absolutely no benefits.
bad,Honeywell is trying really hard to be relevant to today's consumers. There is a sense that they had been caught flat footed and are desperately trying to save face on the IoT front.
bad,Honeywell  name stands out for its self but it is the worst company to work. It does  provide job security and make sure you can take care of home but it does nickel and dime you on the little raises they give if it is given at the time. If you are looking for job security this would be the place to work but you will run into petty management.
bad,"I have never had a more horrible experience in the workplace as I did with Honeywell."
bad,"Working at honeywell was a pleasant working atmosphere, my co-workers and I got along well. Not a stable company without layoffs."
bad,"I worked there as a contractor. To do any work there on APU engines you had to log onto Honeywells computers using a ID and pass word they give you. The whole time I was there I had problems logging onto the computers with the ID and pass word given me. Even when my supervisor tried to log in with my info he had problems. The trainer given me was a very young kid who had problems with wanting every thing set just right, tools had to be laid out just in order and put back into the order, when I would lay a tool down out of his order he would get mad and go complain about me. I was given another trainer who did not want to train any one but said he just wanted to go into inspecting. He would not train me but leave and go off some where? This job was a night mare."
bad,Honeywell Makes you hustle. The more you do the more they will ask of you. They pick and choose there rules as you go along. What is fair for one employer might not be fair to the next.
bad,"Main initiative of company going forward is cost reduction and commercialization of products in the public sector. This is leading to lots of job losses in the USA, and outsourcing labor to India."
bad,Huge organization with the power of leadership to help with escalations. You will learn a lot about supply chain management and intimacy with sub-tier suppliers
bad,"there are always changes being made.You never stop learning, Upper management is horrible and disappointing.The part of the job is getting the accesses to the system to get your job done. I like you are not micromanaged,"
bad,"Honeywell drives behaviors that promotes short sighted results and solutions, the turn over of executives is just impressive, senior leadership tenure in general is no more than 2 or 3 years."
bad,"The technicians and other support staff are wonderful, these are the best assets this company has. There are ZERO opportunities for support staff to advance in this company.  They are only looking at Tradies or engineers to become Project or Operations Managers.  Pay rises are almost non-existent and job satisfaction is very low.  Highly dictated by USA and their demands, resulting in a lot of unnecessary departments to go through to do the simplest of tasks."
bad,"Les plus :"
bad,"The hardest part about working at Honeywell was how training was conducted. There isn't any structure to how they train new employees and what the ""Trainer"" (the person that you are told to listen to about the machines) doesn't teach you have no easy way to learn."
bad,"Company had good structure and good product range.  Lack of support across the board for sales roles and changes to management meant US style management implemented and many good staff left."
bad,Technology used is behind the curve and work is consistently pushed to emerging markets.  Management is solely focused on reducing costs and increasing stock price.  Find somewhere else where employees are looked at as an investment/asset.
bad,"I only loved the pay. pay is great. I worked in the basement so you don't get to see the sun. management is awful. healthcare benefits STINKS!!!!!   I had Kaiser through my employer and when I got into a bus accident on my way into work, I had to cover all my bills. anyway after paying the bills, I ended up receiving a Kaiser Permanente bill and they told me its because of the type of healthcare Plan I have through Honeywell. Its Limited meaning they cover so much and then you use that Healthcare Spend Account card to cover co-pay but they're wasn't any money on the card."
bad,you get no help from any supervisors.  It would be a good place to work at if we get the right tools to do our jobs.  You struggle to do a good job. The company feels like it is setting you up to fail
bad,"Great company to work for with great stock options. However there never any raises. Unless you get what you want with compensation in the very beginning, it will never happen. They just add more responsibility and work but never compensate their employees. This company only cares about profits not their employees. The health insurance is horrible. They stopped contributing to Health Savings Accounts = a lot of out-of-pocket expenses. The management is over paid and over staffed. The middle managers get hit with the bulk of work and are not properly supported to effectively meet Honeywell goals. Always chasing a pot of gold, where hard work is not rewarded. Smart Grid Solutions over promises with clients and under deliveries due to the inability of management to realistically support program delivery teams in efforts to deliver programs and projects that are poorly priced, understaffed, and have dysfunctional IT."
bad,"A typical day consists of taking readings, troubleshooting, and running multiple units.  Great coworkers.  Upper level management(above plant manager), makes all the calls and do not want foremen to get along with union employees."
bad,"I think if I was hired directly into Honeywell I would have a different perspective.  But... my company was bought out by Honeywell.  I watched them break down everything that was good about the company to make us comply with new corporate standards.  Changes were expected, but to have company paid benefits replaced with worse employee paid, was just the tip of the iceberg.  You become just a number to them.  If they are not meeting the shareholders expectations, the first thing they will do is a reduction in workforce.  This happened pretty consistently at the end of each quarter.  I worked in IT and I can tell you something is wrong when the top 4 IT leaders resign in the same month..."
bad,"I’ll tell you a true story from Honeywell where I was  working for about 1 year and few months and they offered me to became permanent I did all the paperwork and a test   Wich was positive and that man told everyone the result wich I know its a bit confident.after few hours they did me another one wich was negative and they told me to go home and I’ll receive a phone during that day to see if I’ll go back . And now the funny part , they call me. And told me to come back to work , obviously was the end  of year of month and of the quarter a very busy month and short  staff . I was the oldest one from my team with the most experience .after few weeks I receive another mail wich  they was. Saying my first date like Honeywell employee will be 1st of the month .and after another 2 weeeks they send me another email to tell me is not anymore 1st of month and in 4 day they kicked me .."
bad,"buen ambiente de trabajo, se fomenta el trababjo proactive entre compañeros"
bad,Everyday is Hectic.  The Supervisors don't understand what goes on day to day.  Very little communication.  People work against each other. Very unorganized work place. Have to be able to work all the problems out on your own. No management guidance.
bad,"une entreprise au main de gens peu scrupuleu."
bad,After all our hard work achieving top site in UK and profitable products for Honeywell...head office decision  to close st asaph factory  making staff redundant..plus basic redundancy package for workers..wheres your  loyalty Honeywell.....
bad,they do not like advancing pay they will use Sinister means of getting rid of people to eliminate paying unemployment. they prefer firing to laying off. Will give unattainable request. This way they can fire you with out unemployment. Management is very underhanded. HR does approve of this method. They conspire with management. They are not employee oriented at the Greer repair and overhaul South Carolina site. Corporate is different. They appear to help their employees.
bad,Negative oppressive work environment with lackluster management and almost non existent Human Resources contact available. The management for Kuehne and Nagel (Honeywell contracting) instilled favoritism in certain employees while neglecting harder working employees in advancement opportunities.
bad,Honeywell is a good old boy place that has very poor judgment.
bad,"You cut fabrics and have to make a designated production rate."
bad,"Too many meetings, harsh work culture. Micromanaged. Very heavy on metrics and if you are not performing to the max, management will call you out in front of coworkers."
bad,Stressful place to work... the business outlook is not good...it was a good money maker and the people under management were very good to work for and with...
bad,Very big company with many managers and politicians but limited engineering
bad,"Good company, a lot of work in progress but need more technical and human resources to accomplish all goals. The best co-workers."
bad,"Es un call center y todo el estres que conlleva, el ambiente laboral es sumamente tóxico"
bad,"Bad experience but see for yourself everybody is diferent maybe for you is good , but I know people that had the same experience as me and reason why they are always hiring"
bad,"Not a good management, as there are many old timers still work there They survive by not sharing the historical info. Management do not have a fair stick to judge people and manage. Harassment is prevalent"
bad,Jaren aan het lijntje gehouden met een jaar contract en dan er weer uit voor 3 maanden daarna zelfs een half jaar.slijmballen krijgen een vaste baan en harde werkers met hart voor de zaak worden  niet gezien.sfeer is ook slecht.

bad,Very worst in job safety dominated by bangalore people only treating like..... Bad experience I had but It good compare to finance overall Company is good management is worst
bad,"Ein Konzern, der nicht begreift, daß nur engagierte Mitarbeiter ihn stark machen ."
bad,"Even though there are contracts in place, Honeywell doesn't feel it necessary to honor contracts.  Especially at end of fiscal year when bonuses hit.    Huge contractor lay offs even though contracts were for much longer.   Worse place for contractor/consultants."
bad,"Great pay but 50+ hrs a week minimum. East manufacturing building is the better building to work in as far as air quality. The work pace is also slower, but the assembly work is much heavier."
bad,Not good. Not a very good company. Would not recommend anyone to work for this employer. Please try to seek other opportunities if possible. Seeking to be insane is a plus.
bad,CB&I has a misconstrued oversight of what subordinates worth to management. The management style of CB&I is to have all salary employees off when convenient and have hourly employees stay long hours for little production
bad,"Honeywell is a global organization and a great place to work for, so many diversified nationalities, provide the learning opportunities to its employees"
bad,"Don't bother taking additional roles and responsibilities. Constantly flexing down, and retention is not based on performance or need. Retention is based of buddy system with management."
bad,"worked at CPCL chennai, associated with the installation of honeywell gas detection system."
bad,"Not sure what they wanted.... and how they wanted to accomplish their goals... at least back then..."
bad,"Medtronic was a GREAT place to work, they treated their employees with respect and recognition. I learned alot of skills that has given me my work experience in Quality Assurance to be a consciencious worker."
bad,"not a great place to work, no job security. company does not care about the workers, only their pockets."
bad,hourly workers aer easy to work with/supervision does not communate well

bad,"if you like to work a lot of hours, then it's a good fit for you.  Not a lot of recognition given out for the hard work.  good overtime if you want it"
bad,"If this is a temporary position you will be finished up in 11 months."
bad,"Don't get me wrong, I really wish I had my job back and I would return in a heartbeat.  But it's getting tough there.  The company is tightening down and the pressure is rolling down."
bad,poor management no sick time off disorganized work flow very poor workstation lighting outdated / obsolete test equipment lack of production supplies inadequate / broken hand tools
bad,Great place and environment to work.Supervisors and management made it unpleasant. No one got a raise while I was there including engineers. I am not sure how much more I need to write to be able to move on from this section.
bad,"I would not work for a company like honeywell ever again, it is 100% profit driven, and moving all of its high paying jobs overseas. They foster the harshest working environments possible by driving employees against management and management success on the reduction of employees."
bad,Very poor company to work for. Depressing environment with a few loyal employees being massively underpaid and under appreciated. Friends of management promoted and elevated in positions beyond their skill set. Most true skilled workers have been forced out through poor pay or have now retired.
bad,"My first week in this office, I was incredibly excited! I was promised a higher wage than all of my previous employers, full-time hrs in a temp-to-perm position, and I knew I was able to excel at the job at hand. However, before my first paycheck, they had already cut my hours in half. In fact, upper management had wanted all the temps to be unemployed, but because of the tenacity of my direct supervisor, they agreed that the 3 of us temps could split the full time hours. It was a grueling 4 months of 20 hrs a wk (wasn't told that it would be such a long period of time, but I remained hopeful), yet I couldn't find anything to replace it since my previous employer had already found my replacement. When the program ramped up, we were expected not to go home without scheduling every last appointment slot even though the phone lists they had given us to call were completely defunct and irrelevant. This was the middle of summer, and even though the days were longer, it was dark by the time we would leave the office at 9pm during these times. My temp agency didn't help either, as they were the client of Honeywell. Unfortunately, because of a hiring freeze we had no knowledge of, they had no intention of hiring any of us although we worked VERY hard to prove ourselves. It was a loose-loose situation"
bad,"The company moved to mexico."
bad,very poor management the superintendent was a scaffold builder a year ago if that tells you anything. i was told the work schedule would be 4 10s and then it was 3 12s and a 6 only for them to change it every week. you never know what your going to get into and there is high radiation everywhere you go with min protection. would be a great place to work if they would get a proper management team in place
bad,falta de estructura laboral y planeacion de prioridades generales.
bad,This is a government contract....Honeywell overall in this situation is being ran as a production type environment. this is not what we do here at APS-3.  Army Preposition Stock.
bad,"Solder Parts, Glued and Assembled Parts. Worked day shift. From 6 am. to 6 pm. Learned how to solder. Management was ok. Co-workers would tell you the wrong way to assemble parts or not tell you all of what you are suppose to do. The job was not hard. Just as most companies there is a lack of communication. Job Security."
bad,Job required no skill sets besides paying attention if the systems were working properly. Certain parts of management had no clue to what was happening. Hardest part of the job was keeping busy and staying awake.
bad,Work Extensively in SAP for 13 Services Buyer.  Set up New vendors in SAP.  Create Puchase Orders and change orders in SAP.  Worked with the Manger of Procurement with Administrative duties. Invoice Resolutions. 
bad,Honeywell seem to always to be in the rear and trying to get ahead.
bad,"There was a lot to learn and no one to teach it. Driving was impossibly long. Management never wanted me there, but corporate had a bold idea."
bad,"Little to no help from upper management in running your department. UAW workers are disrespectful, combative, and have extremely poor work ethic. Conditions are filthy and the hours are extremely long. I sincerely recommend that you do not work here."
bad,No work life balance. Anti-American sentiment. All jobs expendable.  Firm brings in workers from out of the country and they overwork them but once you join you are stuck.  Any American job is not safe as they will replace you and give job to someone outside the US with a lower pay rate.  No work from home.
bad,"The HYPE is real - but reality is much different. The is no morale building, no pay increase incentives and workers are seen as a liability more than an asset. Where there are so many near by businesses that build their people up, Honeywell has no such commitment. The quality of their site management is poor, and they have very poor supervisor. Some department have had 5 supervisors in a single year. The worst part of management, is the lack of understanding of there own positions and efforts to help workers make there goals. They do  not listen to their own direct in line workflow managers, further showing there lack of commitment to workers accomplishing anything other than the basic parts per hour. No matter the hype, Honeywell is NOT a continuous growth environment and not a team building company. Pay is not based upon your value you are a cog in a machine. They do not value the individual, as they can simply hire more bodies, because they pay slightly more per hour and indoctrinate you with great promises. Frankly, Overtime is there only good thing and they have now eliminated it or are taking swift steps to do so, because they have over hired and now seek to reduce staff by bearing down on the lack of productivity, they created by over-hiring ""and not supervising, training and leading there workforce to there own goals."
bad,"Demasiado favoritismo para las promociones, no se fijan en el talento del empleado si no en conocencias"
bad,"Stressful and unrewarding, middle management are ineffective and there is no positive reinforcement of anything done well. Unreachable and unrealistic targets which demoralise the team."
bad,"Sorry, theres not much I can say about the organisation, I was there 4 years and this was one of the most stressful environments I have ever worked in, micro management was very much the word of the day."
bad,Team mates are some of the best people. Management is only concerned with the charts and spreadsheets. Not the information behind them. You are not given credit for a job well done by management
bad,Very stressful environment created by the management.  No responses to the problems. Unfair evaluation of the employees using the Personal Improvement System.
bad,Over worked and under paid. More people resign than they can hire so the turnover rate is ridiculously high. 15 min breaks for 12hrs shift. Outdated equipment and no room for advancement
bad,The managers there were not ethically minded. They used the scrap metal sales for their own personal use. The cutthroat actions of the tenured staff level was not a good environment. The favorites were usually allowed to be lazy and were extended special benefits over the normal shop floor personnel. I would never at that facility again!
bad,"Its really hard to survive in a company like Honeywell as company dont have processes and management is also not so good, no work life balance. "
bad,Constantly working 12 hr days 6-7 days per week. All benefits were stopped being compensated by company. Departments shutting down. Must take a pay cut to lowest pay grade to keep position.
bad,"Honeywell as an employer is terrible. "
bad,"good place to learn technology and work ,"
bad,"-Consistent 90+ hour work weeks on salary with no additional compensation."
bad,"While at honeywell, I worked more than 12 hours/day consistently.  Although the project was 'Cost-Plus' we didn't get bonuses, but we worked for the company to get the bonus pay.  It was a cut-throat environment that was very stressful."
bad,"Financially a very strong company. Salaries are paid on time. Because of high level of nepotism, job culture is below average. Rating of job security is 3/10."
bad,there is nothing positive to say about honeywell. so best not to say anything at all. There were 3 seperate rules for the staff depending on which catergrey you fell in.
bad,"Originally the company was AlliedSignal.  After AlliedSignal purchased Honeywell, multiple layers of management were added. "
bad,"great place to work but the job security is not there,  there is always layoffs and the atmosphere is not good very bad attitude from employees"
bad,"Been here for 3 years now, no opportunity for advancement. They will lie to you during the interview process to get you in. $16.44 until at least 2019. Swing shifts 7 on 2 off. Alot of drafts, no time for family life."
bad,"Work life balance non existing. horrible work environment "
bad,"Honeywell was a good place to work at first. Management doesn't communicate, if someone harasses you ( like I was experiencing) they will not take care of the issue. Everyone there talks behind your back. Nothing is good enough for this place. Was very disappointed."
bad,"Promotions are based on Yes-Men, not expertise. Efficient production is rightfully stressed but marred by bureaucratic 5S guidelines that ironically replace the production flow plan with ""are your desks clean enough?"", ""are you making enough suggestions to make things better so we as management can pretend like we are listening?"". The actual truth is that a quota is required to be met each month by management with these employee suggestions so they don't care if there are good suggestions or bad suggestions just as long as they meet a quota. THE NUMBER OF IDEAS is more important than the actual idea. Honeywell is all about numbers to print in a company newsletter and not at all about their employees or improving their workflow or their customer or employees' lives or livelihood. Worst company I've ever worked for. I enjoyed working more at a pizza restuarant when I was younger."
bad,"work hard, with no advancement. Pore leadership. Needing to keep your head high. Needing to work hard every day.supervisors need to be vetted better."
bad,"I was on call 7 days a week for almost three years."
bad,"nuclear work that requires a government clearance. Shift work either 8 or 12 hours , 6 days a week."
bad,"At typical day at work just depends on where you are in the company. What I've learned is when you've become a large fish in a small pond you need to find a larger pond. Management is like any other global outfit. Some are good, some are bad, some are worst."
bad,"Very Interesting company with a weekly and extremely high turnover. Poor management, plus a typical day is just trying to have a means to an end."
bad,"Honeywell Phoenix facility has a large number of full time employees who feel that Honeywell has done them wrong. So these individuals as payback will work a little as possible, forcing the contractors to pickup the slack. Its clear to see who these employees are, but management does nothing and sometimes even enable this type of behavior. I can understand where these employees are coming from. Honeywell has taken alot away from them in the last 7 to 8 years, but with that being said. If you are unhappy with your current employer, move on and the stop screwing over your fellow co-workers that still like working there."
bad,"A poor workplace. Possibly my experience could be different from others, but it's really a company where you are employed due to your family/friends. If you're not one of them, they will give you the grunt work while they get to work late, and leave early. You will be held to a higher standard than all of their tenured employees who hardly produce as much."
bad,Not a fan of “unlimited vacation”. It’s not really a perk. People who have been working there 30+ years are getting denied vacation even only taking a couple weeks. Insurance benefits are terrible  they should scrap unlimited vacation and bring back work from home  areaterriblet30000
bad,"Every business unit at Honeywell has a different situation, but at HPS, managers spend more time in meetings and managing upwards than they do adding value. This would be fine if lower level managers were empowered to make decisions."
bad,"The company is technologically advanced, the programs and software are very up to date. The culture is sort of a cut throat culture, it all about results."
bad,"Inconsiderate, unfriendly, unprofessional, very very poor management.  The manager would tell me one thing and tell others a different story, wow.  Also, I witnessed back stabbing attitude in the materials lab."
bad,"Manager micromanaged every step in the process... It was their way or the highway.  We were not treated as intelligent contributors. When someone wanted to move on, the manager would retaliate by adding a do not rehire to the persons HR file.  This happened to me, and to others who worked for this manager."
bad,"High stress environment.  Micromanages day to day activities.  Must overcome cultural differences (language, lack of a sense of urgency, etc)."
bad,when i first got the job i was exited to start and i earned my emplloyent there by being a temp for over a calendar year . then i was stagnant in the company as far as advancement but not as far as responsibility being dumped on me so i looked to further my career elsewhere.
bad,"No se trata de una empresa que cuide a sus empleados, los mandos medios no son profesionales y existe una altisima tasa de nepotismo."
bad,"Honeywell was very disappointing to me, i receive $0.30 p/h raise in the time I worked there aprox 2.5 years."
bad,"Large focus on micro-management.  Work schedule is not 40 hours a week, more like 60+ hours a week.  Lastly, they are not customer focused which was distressing to me. Management acted & treated the resellers/partners, like they were on Honeywell payroll.  Big turnoff for partners/resellers."
bad,"Working at Honeywell was much like being on a pirate ship. The saying ""The beating will continue until moral improves"" is an accurate metaphor to the way management treated its employees. On more than one occasion a direct supervisor lied on my yearly review and when I called them out on it, nothing was done. "
bad,"Honeywell Aerospace has all but destroyed it's once wonderful corporate culture. cut throat meet the numbers is now the theme and job security is at an all time low."
bad,"Nice people. CEO sucks all of the money for himself and denies raises and good benefits for the workers."
bad,"the decisions are made without consider any impact to the employees."
bad,"Tools to perform tasks were scarce. Management didn't address issues."
bad,"The management was frequently called mismanagement. When i started it was a cool place to work but, became a sweat shop. Unlimited hours and then mandatory. Never enough. I asked 1 guy in the office why he had 2 desks. He said he was doing the job of what used to be 3 people. Life is too short for that stress. Every year they took away some benefit and got to the point it wasn't worth staying.I wish I had quite way sooner."
bad,Very hectic.. work life balance is completely  messesd up.. really long hours.. no one cares for employee benefits.. outdated infrastructure.. very slow decision making
bad,"The Hardest part of the job is dealing with the Management. Honeywell, as a whole is a great great company but moral is terrible and seems as if management do not care to address that particular issue. They ask the same questions every other day. The Only real knowledge they have is responding to emails or either holding pointless meets, which they love to do. The real success of the company comes from the techs and a few engineers. Management doesnt have a clue."
bad,"It felt like sinking on a boat. It was a very unfortunate time in my career. As people started leaving for other opportunities, the workload became very stressful and toxic. It did not end well."
bad,"I worked there as IT contractor for 4 years."
bad,Until they can get their management fixed their I do not recommend working there. The management can not seem to work together and fix problems that go on in there. You have managers the do not care about their workers by running the pack line to the bare minimum and running more machines then what the average person can handle in the pack line by there self.
bad,"If you're in manufacturing or operations, go somewhere else.   Honeywell wants to be a software, marketing, and design company.  Making stuff is a cost center to be minimized.  HOS means ""Hammer on Staff""."
bad,"To many changes at once and so much disregard for the people.  Corporations go through difficult times often and most businesses are cyclical,  but the way Honeywell handled these times was terrible.  When financial troubles came, they took the money from the employees in the way of furloughs, pay cuts, merit increases, benefit cuts.  The stress within the environment has created a lot of animosity.  There were so many good people who were dedicated to the company and they were just tossed out.  "
bad,"Run from this company if you ever want to see your family or have any sort of work/life balance.  I was a production supervisor and Honeywell successfully squeezed every ounce of energy and waking hour out of me until I finally called it quits.  The cost of taking HON's money on my quality of life was just too much.  "
bad,"don't agree with production system use of human hands for placing sox on boot maker to produce boots, the robotic system needs to be upgraded to work more effectively. the current system causes harm and joint damage to the hands from prolonged use of human hands to place the inside sox on the boot maker arm."
bad,"As Honeywell continues to look to stay at forecasted margins by cutting costs as sales stagnate, work/life balance has suffered due to backfills not being hired for vacated position. Add the lack of merit increases, furloughs, and a toxic management culture to the mix really led to a negative experience. I would avoid if possible."
bad,"j'ai appris beaucoup sur le ta "
bad,"Worked a 40 hour per week, learned how demanding a sales driven organisation operates and what lengths senior management are prepared to go to achieve sales targets, very high expectations upon staff with limited rewards. Attrition was in excess of 24% during 2016 , this was probably due to the work environment and demands, although the contact centre industry is very competitive in Scotland salaries were not competitive enough to keep good staff. The most difficult part of the role was the people management aspect, it was a multi cultural centre with different nationalities. The most enjoyable part of the job was the initial set up phase building the centre from ground zero to what it is today. It's difficult to write about positives when there's been so many negatives in the past 24 months, motivation has been difficult when so many changes have impacted what was an attractive company to work for."
bad,I do not have an opinion of Honeywell outside of the fact that there has been a significant amount of change over the past 24 months which has created a challenging work environment.
bad,My experience there was terrible the company was in a hiring freeze and kept bringing in long term temps and over loading the workers.
bad,Working with co-workers was good and the working hours was also good working Monday thru Thursday. I learned about intensive quality management and safety.
bad,Employees are told the company is doing so well and in the same breathe they are laying of massive amount of employees. You are always on guard as to whether or not you will have a job.
bad,"The job that I was involved in did not work for me.  Slow testing periods, a lot of paperwork.  Training was somewhat good.  The atmosphere was low key and for the majority coworkers were good to get along with."
bad,Honeywell has lost sight of serving the customer. Poorly planed implementation of the Honeywell operating system(HOS) has lead to low employee morale and a big loss in efficiency. Now most employees focus on job security rather than doing a good job. Several project failures and missed deadlines attest to poor corporate culture that now prevails at Honeywell ITS.
bad,"Typically this company is a boring company, the management try to changed thing around by out source 39 job and contracting out that job, and they been focusing on the meeting more then producing parts.  I have learn so much from my jobs, my co-workers are nice.  The hardest part of the job that all the machine are old and can break anytime.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when I got to work on the machine."
bad,"The chasm between corporate Honeywell and the average Honeywell employee has never been greater. The benefits have changed dramatically, they price it high, but low enough so you do not go out and get obama care.  Morale is pretty low, although i do like most of co-workers and they provide a good work environment."
bad,"I gave 110% and made 1 mistake and was terminated.   They did not take in account for my exceeding expectations yearly reviews, or the BRAVOs that I went above and beyond to get the plant back up and running, keeping the plant running, or my actions to keep the plant from having an environmental release of deadly chemicals."
bad,"Reviewing material procurement and build project status daily."
bad,"A typical work day could consist of building 15 units in one cell and then going to two to three different cells to do other units. Learned that no matter how hard you work they don't compensate you for your effort. Management has a huge lack of communication. Managers hardly ever communicate things down to production level. The hardest part of the job is going into work not knowing what you are going to get into that day, whether it be where you are working or if your manager is going to curse you out that day. The most enjoyable part of the job is clocking out and going home to my family."
bad,the company is a hard place to pleas and they show favoritizim to sertan employies
bad,"New VP has made comments in regards to treating our suppliers like they are useless to the company. ""Beat and Beat and Beat them until you get what we want"" is not how I want to treat any of my suppliers."
bad,Empresa relativamente nueva falta cultura de trabajo en equipo y lderazgo muy pobre lamentablemente.Les deseo lo mejor !!
bad,learning is very low here. discrimination is there.salary hike is very low according to the work load. team work. manager is very good & understand us
bad,"Very  poor  management and  way too  much  favoritism.  There's  leads assistant  leads, supervisors,  assistant  supervisors.  Too  many  ""bosses "" and  none  of  them  know  what's  going  on. This  company  doesn't  appreciate  their  employees  at all. I wouldn't  recommend  this  place  to  anyone."
bad,I was able to develop many new computer programs and work with database management for many projects along with working with many good field personnel but management never fully supported my efforts due to their lack of understanding of the complexity of my tasks.
bad,"Inconsistent funding, lots of management churn, not empowering, high health care costs. Research and development projects are dominated by a few and there is little chance for advancement.Very competitive internally."
bad,"The company is spread all across the world, most of my time was spent meeting with people in India. This means at least 2 meetings per day and another 1-2 hours of updating various databases with the results of those meetings before you can do any real work. I highly recommend you find a position elsewhere unless you love wasting massive amounts of time tracking work, updating your (many) superiors - some of which are overseas, and recording minutia in several databases."
bad,"Was contractor, did what I was supposed to do until project completions.  Like all large global companies, Honeywell did what it had to make as much profit as possible."
bad,"Honeywell is a fine company that has taken the questionable approach of contracting out much of its labour. Consequently, few people actually care about the work being done or the projects they’re working on. Turnover is very high and they don’t hesitate to cut contractors when desired"
bad,"Low scores reflect the state of my direct management only and not Honeywell as a company. I love the work I do and the customers I work with.  I positively impacts others on a daily basis which is very important to me.  Unfortunately, management is inept in leadership skills which creates a hostile work environment. The saying ""People don't leave companies, they leave managers"" is VERY TRUE!"
bad,Very long hours at Honeywell...no work life balance...not appreciated. They need to quickly improve culture or they will continue to loss great talent.
bad,"If you're looking for a career this isn't the place for you."
bad,"Like all American companies; its about the bottom line, and the employees are just a means to increase the by whatever means the senior leadership choose. Expect absolutely no job security or real advancement as your job could be at risk on a whim. I have worked for Honeywell for over 20 years and watched it be dismantled from inside by a constant string of poor leaders who hide their mis management with constant re-structuring , work force reductions and acquisitions. Overall the workforce unhappy and leaving in droves. Latest strategy to force people our the door without paying them redundancy is moving everyone in to hubs; like its no work from home policy, another victorian measure. Honeywell thinks it is a modern software company, but is so far from this it is unbelievable. Don't even consider working for Honeywell unless other than as a short term stepping stone."
bad,they require you to pick a certain amount of items a day and correctly.  If you make a mistake you get a write up and after 3 they will let you go.  You will be on your feet walking the whole day in the warehouse to pick the orders.
bad,All the time Process Transition and whatever employee left out that have to suffer to find job internally or externally.They will send you out without helping to settle down in different process.Poor Management they will not help you out.
bad,"Even that they know that they used to have ateam of at least 6 to 8 management system employees they want to believe in their minds that can be kept by 2 employees, regional director and site director don't have a clue of the actual state of the building they are silurvivots.they check what side to be ehen it comes to critical and imporyant decisions."
bad,"The work performed here is exciting with the knowledge that the engineer is able to create custom systems that are not commerically available and create projects that are dependent on multidiscplinary teams. However due to constant changes of department philosphy and low attrition rates, it becomes extemely difficult to maintain a common standard of knowledge and procedures. There is also an increasing amount of management that are pulled to oher priorities that do not concern their department that they are unable to properly review work performed in their own department."
bad,This is a good company with poor management. Finance is the worst. They are always forcing top down poor targets based not based on running a business.  The work life balance doesn't exist.  There is no real healthcare since the deductible is astronomical
bad,"First off its a union plant and they are letting contract workers take our work from us , they do not follow their own policies , they will discipline you without any due notice they also are guilty of co-employment"
bad,"Unorganized staff"
bad,">(typical day) not too stressful, always something to do"
bad,"Nepotism and favourtism is rife which leads to a culture where the professional and skilled are the ones who suffer."
bad,"Employee base is not empowered as culture is designed to require employees ask for permission to, well frankly do anything."
bad,"Okay for a person who's not seeking full time work. there's not much that I can really say, its not the company its the people. there's always for improvement."
bad,"I should have never taken this job. My skills as an electrical engineer were not needed, despite the fact that I was there for a LabVIEW Test Engineer. I never got to work with LabVIEW like I was told. They have this culture of NOT using comments in their coding, and their schematics. Management is hostile to any complaints regarding efficiency. My manager was weak and ineffective. The ONLY 8 hours a day work I ever got was when he LOANED me to another group that did use my skills: Electrical Engineering. There are no opportunities to transfer as everyone there is ""hungry for work""."
bad,"Bad pay, and feels like and office monkey,."
bad,"Even in a good economy, Honeywell does not invest in its employees.  Good people are leaving every single week.  Management is not providing good strategic direction other than ""cut the budget""."
bad,The workplace culture is no longer like a Canadian company. The work day start and end with meetings. The most enjoyable part of the job is get job done.
bad,"No chance for advancement. Terrible training, even worse management. I would no recommend this particular Honeywell business to anyone.  Senior leadership needs to be more in touch with how the business works."
bad,"This division is in the process of reducing its work force as it's due to be spun off into a new separate company."
bad,"The Clearwater management team continues to disappoint me. They have no clue and do not want to improve....THEY KNOW IT ALL! Upper level management has talked down to the team, they make promises to customers they cant keep and do not appreciate their employees."
bad,"Company has a good business in the India."
bad,The business unit is being spun off - very uncertain times with new upper management that do not know what they are doing.  Multiple positions were eliminated leaving gaps in providing product and services to the customers.
bad,"As stated above this site, due to its uncertain future, would not be a good fit for those contractors hoping to join Honeywell. Contractors are used as a stop gap measure due to poor operational planning and may be on site up to two years before knowing whether they will obtain a full-time position. The communications channels between management and contract personnel is poor as it pertains to performance, training, and overall inclusion into the organization and operation."
bad,"I have worked for the company for a while now.   I will say money can definitely be made working for Honeywell Spectra, but you will have to change you're lifestyle completely to work here.  Sure, you can support a family here, but you will spend way more time working than with you're loved ones.  This is one of the MANY flaws with this site."
bad,The unfortunate thing is I have to write this review.  The fortunate thing is I have to write this review.  Overall Honeywell cares about the almighty dollar not about the employee. Corporate America at its finest and not in a good way.  I would state that if you wanted a company not to mirror how they treat their employees it would be Honeywell.  They have absolutely no concern for their employees
bad,"good to learn on technology side and  new projects.  they allow people to know wat they are working tthere and how to learn from the mistakes "
bad,"Honeywell used to be a company where I had an optimistic point of view, but this is no longer the case. There is no room for advancement in your career here. It is difficult to get any sort of promotion or change roles in any capacity."
bad,As a branch of a worldwide corporation this particular facility has become a very poorly managed company that has suffered enormous financial losses due to extremely bad management which in turn affects employees and ultimately the quality of the product. In six years that I was a part of the organization we went through 3 different site leaders none was able to make a favorable change which led to a deteriorating working environment and loss of customers due to continuous defects in the product. It is a company with lots of potential but unfortunately the employees can only do their share and ultimately the decision making is not up to them. I worked with a lot of great people as far as coworkers but the support from the upper management is non existing.
bad,Lots of Hardworking People. Pays better than most other companies with respect to the type of work being performed. Plenty of work with an abundance of overtime
bad,"They use you to make money , but dump you once the going gets though to safe money."
bad,Honeywell is not a manufacturing company but rather an acquisition company. In my mind they are not concerned about the quality of the products they make but rather how many units they can sell.
bad,"Only certain employees will make good money."
bad,"constant churn of management and ideas along with high turnover and burnout.  there is no higher cause then to say you work for a company that is attempting to make money, not save the world, cure cancer or anything like that - corporate America - make money."
bad,"If you're an independent contractor, you're basically below dirt on their feet - especially in the material management department. The two women that work there consistently treat any new hire/contractor terribly and continue to get away with it just because of their knowledge of the job. Stop hiring a 3rd person and just let them have that area, no one will ever be good enough. They went through 3 people prior to me, then at least 3 more after I left."
bad,"Constant Furloughs, no pay raises in the last 2 year, benefits are terrible (high deductibles)  and now they are putting employees on PIP to justify no pay raises or promotions."
bad,Horrible working environment! One of the leads on my shift (3rd shift) was very rude and inappropriate! He wasn't  professional at all. He would cuss at people over everything and would say nasty things to the women there and would get you in trouble for absolutely no reason!. I told the manager about it on my shift and he did nothing at all and said he would. The work is easy but nobody can deal with some one like that everyday at work especially if it's there lead!
bad,Very isolated from other groups and the work was OK. Had good CM for change control. Poor management if you are contractors.
bad,"The last several years have seen the company become crippled by bureaucracy and conservatism which has substantially driven up internal costs, thus making the company less competitive."
bad,"I worked the midnight shift .I come in usually a half hour before my shift so I have time to make sure I had everything I needed for the day.we start up by having are safety meeting,Then we go to our machines and do our 5s.thats all are safety checks.setup up are machines to whatever parts we needed to run.d"
bad,Does not take care of employees and has no loyalty. Company has changed and is now becoming a toxic working environment. It's sad to see how bad things have became.
bad,"Coworkers were great. Management sucked, management styles sucked, they will want to brainwash you will cultural alignment propaganda. The work was not much better. If you like to do the exact same thing for your entire career then this is the place. "
bad,"The only reason I stayed with this company is the pay and MY manager other than that I felt like a number, which I was actually assigned."
bad,"Honeywell is a slavedriver and does not give you incentive. Once you are doing great, they RIF you before you get a deserved raise."
bad,"This is the only assembly/production position I have ever held, I have been in the military, and had plenty of retail jobs, and I think this is honestly the worst job I have ever had. I have never gone home every night wondering if I have a job the next day or not until this job. If I were to provide anyone advice on whether or not to work for this company, I would tell them to try Raytheon or BE Aerospace instead."
bad,"Staff is over worked and underpaid.  "
bad,"As whole I find Honeywell lacking. I took the position because I was looking for a challenging engineering position. Initially things were busy with expected night and weekend work, then the bottom fell out. No work to be done, so most days are spent asking for work or doing mindless menial work. Yet still expected to have 99% yield even if the company doesn't have work to be done. I've been told that a lot of the work was pulled forward to improve quarter earning until we simply don't have work to do. I am not the only engineer to be farmed out to a different location. Many have been sent down to Tempe; some without mileage reimbursement. This just adds to the general impression I get that employees are not a top priority. The benefits have been deteriorating for years to the point that I've had contract jobs with better benefits. I think if they keep it up they will find themselves losing a lot of experienced employees to other companies or to retirement and won't be able to compete with others to gain new employees. "
bad,All team members need to excute or or escalate all business no time for personal issues. The most enjoyable part of the job is completing on time & on budget.
bad,I enjoyed working with my piers on the ship but the pay and location was sub standard. The vacation time of leaving the island and return worked against everyone.I do not recommend anyone to apply for shipboard mechanic in the India Ocean region. They loose good people all the time because the right balance of pay for location is not in favor of that region.
bad,"old drawings, old school mentality, outdated methods, people with 20 or more years working there, use unigraphics but don't use teamcenter correctly"
bad,"It is very difficult to hit a moving target. It is exponentially much more difficult if you are not given the right tools. My years with Honeywell has been a study in impossible metrics, balanced with eroding technical support. It is a proven formula to justify outsourcing that is working very well for this company."
bad,"A typical day is 8 hours with 1/2 lunch.  Most of the work if varied and I liaison with Customer Service many times during the day to resolve customer issues and approve orders for shipment.  Upper management changes very frequently as The Company is constantly changing focus and direction.  I have been fortunate to work for the same supervisor for three years and the same manager for five years.  I worked in multiple ERP's and was also on the team to convert to one system, which is SAP.  I worked with many people on the SAP team across all departments and also conducted (and still do as needed) training sessions for employees to learn and use SAP.  I have wonderful co-workers and am part of a great team but the future of my department and location is not secure.  Due to this, I do not feel there is room for promotion or further growth for me.  I worked very closely with the Supervisor and Manager to set department procedures, train new staff and determine how work will be assigned.  I have been assigned many ""special projects"" that require specific handling and discretion due to the nature of the problems.  I have been entrusted with sensitive information so that I am able make good credit decisions for the company. "
bad,"Learned a lot of the product. training is very good."
bad,"Handling all safety system like FA System,PA System,"
bad,"As I am working here from last 1 year 10 months, I don't have good salary, good position after getting good response from Client."
bad,"Help desk"
bad,Injection molding
bad,Serious pay inequities. Even with more experience and a higher degree than all of my subordinates. Addressing this with HR is fruitless for as long as they believe you will not leave.
bad,There is no room to move up. They will always hire from outside rather than promotoe from within
bad,"interseting day at work,learn more on assembly job.good welfare package"
bad,"Unfortunately, this office was not a professional office. The boss was not very professional, used a lot of profanity and would yell and scream at his subordinates on the phone. Lots of unnecessary office politics."
bad,Benefits continued to evaporate over time.The last Supervisor I had was extremely favorite oriented  way too many favorites. You paid the full cost of the Dental insurance.
bad,"Horrible, top down culture driven by a socially awkward CEO that values shareholder value above all else. Top performers suddenly disappear in the constant state of re-organization. Employees don’t have a long term vision or expectations since so many people leave without notice. Some get out on their own and others just disappear. Moral is low, work expectations are unreasonable and work-life balance doesn’t exist.  Furlough’s are common to make quarterly numbers. I’ve seen many people humiliated in meetings. The expectation is to check emails and join meetings from vacation. All levels of employees are unhappy from VP to individual contributors. HR primary job is to reduce work force via re-orgs  to increase operating income. HR is not trusted as a group that anyone can confide.  In general, HON plans to shift as many can workers away from the US to “High Growth Regions” to reduce costs.  "
bad,"I worked for Honeywell in their aviation section in Phoenix. The people on the ground were cool, but management really sucks the fat one. Most were ex-military officers that just used their position for stepping stones; so at the most they were there only a year tops. That made your concerns fairly insignificant. Worse, they created a culture that experience meant nothing and sycophants and cronyism will get you everywhere. Eventually, myself and those of my experience went somewhere else. If you get a job there, understand you will not get anywhere unless you are will to proverbially get on your knees and understand you are nothing and less than nothing."
bad,Work with multiple people across the business which was good experience.  Tops down driven management with little input from those in the trenches.  High stress.
bad,"Work experience is good."
bad,Worked at Honeywell for many years. The benifits were great but were slowly dismantled to just goodland were still getting worse. Managers were never on the the same team.
bad,"Only female in the group and the only person to get daily ridicule from the new boss. The supervisor who hired me was nurturing and genuinely cared for his team.   His replacement treated me very unfairly, to the point I went to HR numerous times to try to resolve the issue. I was belittled for not knowing, off the top of my head, details about projects that had been on hold for the last 8 months. I was given a $4k/y raise because I was not being paid market value for my level of experience. I was underpaid compared to my male co-workers."
bad,Leadership at Honeywell is lacking and needs overhaul. Employees are asked to furlough to overcome financial difficulties directly related to poor management of the company .
bad,Dramatic changes in structure and management in the last few years have made it a difficult environment. Compensation is generally competitive but has been slipping. Dynamic environment allows for good experience and learning.
bad,"Work is Easy although if you expect support, don't"
bad,Senior leaders are inethical and disjointed.   Constantly jerking operations and supply chain.   Constantly chasing single metrics at the cost of the customer.
bad,"The worst job I ever had in a long career. There was no work balance whatever, just long hours. Management did not take responsibility for the project that was a loser."
bad,Leadership is intelligent and wants to be strategic but is too disconnected in some businesses to be able to move things forward in a sustainable manner.
bad,"+ + + + + "
bad,The typical day at work consists of meetings about meetings but surprisingly we still get the job done. The current work culture is lacking due to new implementation of SAP and so many changes. The site is a 100 year old business which was purchased in 2009 and is just now reaching the tipping point of full HW MOS. This means long term employees are really starting to feel the changes ans many do not like it so they have chosen to leave and some have been asked to leave. This is one of the hardest parts of the job for me. Typical to HW site leaders only come in for about 2 years. This causes frustration because they each make changes and sometimes they are conflicting. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.
bad,"I worked for three years. The work is slow paced but lot of opportunities to learn and diverse technologies to work with. Being a product based company, it provided exposure to multiple technologies."
bad,"Great place to work and gain experience. This is a large global (American owned) company which does business in many industries. Mergers & Acquisitions are their greatest strength.  Unfortunately, if acquired, they will most likely ""break"" the company in order to standardize it to their processes."
bad,"I was hired on by a group to do ""Test Engineering"", involving LabVIEW (I""m an expert). The guy they put me under didn't know LabVIEW so well and was threatened by me when I fixed code to the Dataflow methodology NI recommends. They didn't really fire me, but they just didn't give me any ""job codes"" to work on, hence no pay. The last week I was there I was given less than 10 hours of work to do. I can't live on that."
bad,"I have been very happy working for Honeywell so, I was learning many aspects of the bussines line and adhere to the 8 Honeywell's behaviors and do my duries on a daily basiss successfully."
bad,"Age 20-45 Okay place to start a career (Entry Level).  55+  don't waster your time; they're getting rid of all the veterans workers. Absolutely no loyalty, appreciation, respect, or anything else for the older work force except a walk out and kick in the butt."
bad,"I started working for EMS Canada in 2001. I enjoyed my job working in a fast paced Customer Service role working on returns for repair and overhaul. I worked with customers from around the globe. I was very passionate about the job and enjoyed working and solving my customers needs. I built good Customer relationships, gaining trust and reliability. "
bad,"Honeywell (Allied Signal) management philosophy is to promote anyone who can politic.  this is the old allied Signal compnay, poort performance, who bought the Honeywell name and the internal perfomance is not based on skills but rather how you network.  It is all about perception and nothing to do with accomplishments.  This is truely the ""Corporate"" culture everyone loves to hate.  Backstabbing and cutthroat tactics.  There is no trust and no collaboration.  Leaders steall suborniates ideas and call them their own.  Ideas brought up are killed only to resurface later as someone else with a new name.  "
bad,"Honeywell could be a great place to work if they treated their employees with a little more respect and not overload their desks with items that cannot possibly be completed in a 37.5 hour work week."
bad,"I was hired on by a group to do ""Test Engineering"", involving LabVIEW (I""m an expert). The guy they put me under didn't know LabVIEW so well and was threatened by me when I fixed code to the Dataflow methodology NI recommends. They didn't really fire me, but they just didn't give me any ""job codes"" to work on, hence no pay. The last week I was there I was given less than 10 hours of work to do. I can't live on that."
bad,Due to staffing most employees do a lot of different tasks with little supervision - which is great if you like to work that way. There are some departments that have great team environments.
bad,"Take a minute to review Honeywell."
bad,"Very expensive high deductible plan, no working from home which doesn't make sense because you're on conference calls 50% of the day, you have to pay to join the gym, food on site is very expensive, no day care on site"
bad,"The expectations of the amount of overtime people work are not seen as something positive to help the company, it's viewed as unproductive because you are not doing the tasks you are assigned on a daily basis."
bad,Long days; very aggressive deadlines with zero tolerance for failure.  Targets are purposely set unrealistically high so the entire year is spent trying to create and present recovery plans.
bad,"Receive and export raw material"
bad,"Honeywell is understaffed to meet their requirements. With the focus of the company on stock price and cash, decisions are made on a daily basis that have nothing to do with customer satisfaction and only on the bottom line. Honeywell could not care less about its employees. Was not always that way."
bad,"Poor management."
bad,"A very disproportionate number of the employees are temps. ...far more than half (70%+)."
bad,They only cared about their bottom line sent American jobs over-seas and would rather hire subcontractors then have actual employees They basically took away our health care and gave us minimum coverage
bad,"Some managers don't follow professional ethics. Rather than leaders they try to be dictator and induce fear. But there are very good leaders in Honeywell whom we can be inspired by at Honeywell. "
bad,"The team runs very lean, however the Finance team is small in Des Plaines and does not allow for advancement; most team members remain in their roles for 2+ years. The few managers that I have worked with do not focus on employee development."
bad,Expected to live up to expectations that are not clearly explained. Unwilling to provide training for supervisory personnel. Lack of support for supervisors when dealing with problem subordinates.
bad,"job titles do not reflect actual work performed"
bad,"A corrupt organization- failed leadership , hostile environment - Culture shock - No pay vacation. Salary 30% less than everybody in the same business"
bad,"Fast paced, long hours, no support (maintenance, Supervisors or Management Team), worked as much at home after hours as I did on site. Their idea of Maintenance Reliability is to run it to failure and use rental equipment to supplement utilities until the equipment can be replaced by the lowest bidder. The on site project group begs for ideas to generate projects on, but the Production group can never get approval from Management."
bad,I would not recommend working at Honeywell. Extremely short staffed and tremendous pressure placed upon each individual. Most staff has been given additional full-time job duties in addition to current work load due to multiple layoffs.
bad,The place is disorganized and changes the rules of how things are done very often with out doing proper research  of the changes made. Very little room for advancement.
bad,"Worked at the site via an agency on an initial 3 month rolling contract."
bad,The cultural at Honeywell is cut throat.  The leadership is demeaning.  They often cover up their mistakes.  They do not allow you to report overtime on your record keeping and if your caught by HR doing this you are let go.  They deny doing this.
bad,"Very unique business culture. Whilst it is a great place to learn and acquire skills and results are terrific, the company in Switzerland hasn't cared about talent retention, work-life balance for employees and career opportunities. Management too much oriented on politics and risk aversion driving too slow decision sometimes. Compensation is high in comparison to same peers in industry, but HR management doesn't seem to understand that really money is not everything in life..."
bad,"Honeywell the company is solid in the marketplace and makes decisions based upon what is good for the company only.  As far as the employees, management and human factors there is no more than lip service.  Young professionals do not have much mentoring or career guidance.  Salaries are pure cut-throat negotiation with raises being only token in appearance.  "
bad,"Too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  Had Tier meetings from 7 till noon and accomplished nothing.  Then they would wonder why product was not getting built on time.  Having meetings to discuss nothing at all, just to hear themselves talk."
bad,Worked schedule seven days a week. No time off except for the planned shut downs until after five years of employment. If you got hired after June you Had to wait for six years.
bad,Management was not always the best which made it difficult to feel comfortable to work effectively. Would a great place to work in management would sit down and listen to employees that can help with performance as a whole.
bad,"There were movement to consolidate all department across the board to create a centralized ""Center of Excellent"" but the initiative was a disaster and cause a lot chaos and job cuts."
bad,"Management does not seem to have grasp of running this business, very counterproductive and morale very low. Planning is poorly done, which causes lots of headaches and frustration. You come in with best intentions of being very productive and do a great job, not happening, first shift has no clue and your day just goes down."
bad,"Extra busy day. Great traceability systems, Great company to work for!"
bad,"Was formerly Elster Solutions. When Honeywell took over it was ok for a while. Now our networks and IT systems are so messed up and takes longer to do everything. But the worst part is that they do not allow anyone to work at home anymore. Too many new rules, and every two weeks we get assigned additional 'training' to do online. Two people left my team and were not replaced, but the workload keeps increasing."
bad,"There is no direction within this company. It is a stressful environment with no advancement opportunities. Technicians work 60 to 70 hours a week and don't even get a pat on the back for all their hard work. Instead of being rewarded employees are micromanaged, and treated like robots."
bad,"A typical day was spent in 6 hours plus a day of meetings, which led to many hours at night and weekends working to stay afloat."
bad,"Honeywell has taken a liking to the idea of being a ""tech company"" but has not adopted the culture. It is like a 90 year old man dying his hair and showing up at the local theater to see a movie with some teenagers and calling everything rad."
bad,"It was a job during the bad economy."
bad,"Not sure if it's the direction the company is taking or what...but things seem to go from bad to worse. I love the actual job, love most of the people, but the leadership and politics...no words."
bad,"This place is good to work for temporarily, but if you want to stick with a company that is fair, and knows what they're doing, great insurance and great management skills, this is NOT the place for you. Too many management Personnel not distribute throughout the warehouse, too much power hungry ex-militants, basically you have to walk on pins and needles when working in this place so you won't get fired. Overtime is sometimes available, but it is only available when least expected, no 24-hour notice, no life. Permanent employees please read your employment manual. No Union in the Groveport, ohio warehouse..."
bad,"More than 3 downsizes in one year"
bad,The work was not that  hard but you had a number to hit in that hour and if you didn't hit that number then someone in management would come down on you hard about it.
bad,"Junta, revision de correos, Elaboracion de facturas, enviar cargamento, inventario, captura de Finish good, comida, seguimineto  a las 5's."
bad,"frequent layoffs at Honeywell and after talking with employees there, it's just their way of doing business.  They don't really have a ""culture"" persay.  It's just a another corporation putting stock market first, management 2nd."
bad,It good opportunity to learn new thing with a different environment. Growth and achievement totally depends on your senior management.
bad,"Too many changes too fast, good company that will hopefully make a come back. Products are still good, strategy has been off causing business challenges."
bad,"I like the fact that they are a true global company, have global opportunities. Smart people you work with. Good leaders as well. Had the opportunity to work with people in other parts of the world."
bad,"They pay well, but they don't respect their employees and they try to take shortcuts rather than doing things correctly. Horrible company."
bad,ok typical other it companies. co-workers are good management is not that great. ok to work in this company.compensation is not great
bad,"- flexible working hours"
bad,"Nice people.  Local management is good, but they are at the whim of another Jack Welch disciple.  Always trying to squeeze a dime, but never giving it to employees.  Too many meetings: e.g., a ""Tier"" meeting EVERY day.  Little information is passed there that others haven't heard or will hear about.  Just a waste of time."
bad,"A typical day at work involves working with my team and achieving every individual's targets for the day."
bad,"Too many metrics often to leading to bad decisions in the interest of meeting a metric . . . High stress environment.  Many are not satisfied or frustrated."
bad,honeywell has recently lost interest in taking care of their employees.  cutting benefits and retirement back each year more and more.  this along with poor management decisions has made it a less desirable place to finish a career.
bad,"I would go to work and wonder which of my three bosses I would run into first assigning me a task and the the other two would get mad at me for doing because I wasn't doing their tasks.  I would then try to multitask with task that sometimes required hours long telecons with customers, sales engineers, and customer service, which I was able to do for the most part, but caught a lot of grief for doing something for one of my supervisors and not one of the other two.  Once again, I had to work off the clock to stay caught up at times."
bad,Honeywell is a great place to work with people and learning the skills of safety. I am only a temp and there is not a lot of room for advancement.
bad,"The training program started off excellent with two weeks of training, however it is very hard with this company to hire permanently.  The representative for Acro always seemed to not have the answer to employment questions or what our status was with the company we were working for...."
bad,"After one year of employment it was clear there were limited opportunities for advancement within the company. Overall, good people to work with, intelligent and hard working, but would not recommend this employer."
bad,"As a temporary contractor it was required that I work fifty-five hours a week. My work day started typically at 6:00 AM and ended at 4:30PM in the R&O Department. "
bad,"This company may have some decent benefits for some, but do not ever think you will ever be treated as anything more than a number. Management will never keep a persons life in mind. Its all about the profit margin for this giant conglomerate."
bad,"Very fast pace atmosphere.  The people here are great to work with, longevity, with positive feed back."
bad,"No work life balance..Not good company,,,,,,,,"
bad,"Horrible culture where employees are guilty until proven innocent.  No accountability to following policies and procedures as leadership is scared of risk."
bad,It was a job. I loved the mission and my co-workers but we lacked any support from Head Quarters.
bad,At the beginning was a fun enviroments. Then I realize the place wasn't my career at all at the time I was just 18.
bad,"Very good company to work for if you love machining, as they employee alot of machinist."
bad,"I will just make an honest review of my own situation at Honeywell.  I was hired in 2002 and the work life balance and benefits were exceptional.  The pay was above average and the people were fantastic. Fast forward to about 2008 and the company took a large turn towards moving jobs offshore with the goal of cutting US employment cost and maximizing shareholder goals."
bad,"At Honeywell, most works are from DoD contract, It is an unstable working condition, too frequent lay-off. Other than that, it is a good place to work, good benefit, education assistance program."
bad,"Terrible culture, dog eat dog management style. Honeywell is ruthless. Look at HR. About 6 HR managers in the last 4 years. Best one they promoted then corporate ate him alive. If they treat managers like this think about the peons. Its a joke, if you value your self esteem and work/life balance then run away hard and fast. If you want to play roulette with career and always watch your back, come here."
bad,Very demanding company. We work on average of 60+ hours per week and weekends. Compensation is less than fair market for most positions in the company. Raises are small increments. Candidates are sold about advancement when we typically hire from the outside not necessarily promote up.
bad,They treat employee with no respect and poor on the job training. Poor work life balance. No real growth opportunity. Bad work place culture. The work was very unorganized.
bad,"1.5 jobs in 1 job.  Never any time for relationship building.  that's about it. management is only interested in beating people down, not lifting them up.  Honeywell does not share their profits with employees."
bad,"With HON, a LOT depends on who your manager is. You can find your niche and literally retire from the job, or you’ll be subject to bland yearly appraisals, receive a pittance in salary adjustments, work until literally sick, and redeployed should your manager not agree with your work habits, or should you push back. The bureaucracy is byzantine, some managers and sales people are arrogant and abusive. Most people do fine, but are atrociously overworked."
bad,"I really learned a lot, I quit because my boss was so mean and didn’t treat women or black people with respect, after I quit he got fired! I was in quality!"
bad,"Honeywell is a corporate giant which treats its employees as such.  Over the years I was employed benefits got worse, floating holidays taken away, pay cuts, and finally lay offs.  The overhead management choose poor paths to follow and rush products into market before they are ready."
bad,"morning briefing , maybe some training mostly safety on and around the vehicles, management was a disaster the  work place culture was a bunch of retired soldiers looking to tell some pettyness, the most enjoyable part of the job were the one or two  days the men acted like men. and actually have a good day"
bad,"I loved my job and working with the customers for many years however Honeywell's culture is to look only at the bottom line and make drastic reductions in either work force, resources, budgets, etc. and implement repeated furloughs without regard for employees or customers.  As a highly competitive business unit and prominent company, they should put their efforts into driving an exceptional customer experience and quality products instead of driving customers and sales away because of high prices, delivery issues, poor customer service, lack of sales support and many product recalls. They use sales numbers against their employees regardless of the quality of job they perform. The hardest part of my job was that no one cared anymore about doing a good job not even the management."
bad,"Management by intimidation and micro managing.  More H1 visa employees than any company I have seen before.   No continuity, jobs change quarterly and most do not stay in roles more than two years, and customers hate the lack of continuity and lack of consistency.  VPs have no people skills and some leave to other companies and then are hired back 3-5 years later at much higher pay but no increased skills."
bad,The environment is hostile and cannot work effectively here. There is also a lot of nepotism in this organization. The only way to make it up is if you know someone not by your skills.
bad,"23 years in Engineering (currently 1st level Manager) at Honeywell Aerospace in the Phoenix area. Years of cost cutting and new processes has created an environment where it is extremely difficult to meet program requirements. Leadership says everything is great but I don't know of any programs that are on schedule/budget. Then Leadership waists more time/money on bureaucratic meetings to blame the team for execution and ignore systemic problems. However, the stock price keeps going up...so what do I know. Fortunately, my life/family is at a point where I have flexibility to look for work that better fits my ideas on how employees should be treated, so it's time for me to go."
bad,"While the personnel are underpaid and overworked, they are the best part of the company. Leadership lacks and ignores obvious infractions made daily. The company does not allow for promotion form within and lacks leadership and direction in the buildings directly interacting with the employees on a persona level"
bad,"Very poor training for new employees, depending on dept."
bad,Overlapping management system where left hand doesn’t know what right hand is doing. Any politician can survive but a worker cannot.
bad,"Very high expectations of all employees, but the constant transition within the business causes fear and instability.  Working at Honeywell is a great resume builder if you can stick it out, but you may be subjected to low employee morale (though there are many tremendous people to work with)."
bad,"The pay is good and job satisfaction can be rewarding. However the management from the top to bottom is rotten, they always have a 'new plan' to restructure and it always fails. Distinct lack of trust between staff and management. Currently sinking ship. Would be difficult to find a happy honeywell engineer."
bad,"Safety is important but your opinion and pains from the job are never addressed.  Takes 4 ever to get any one to listen to you, and your team leads only care about looking good and the numbers."
bad,"low pay hard work no advancement in job it all, apply and tray . stress stress stress hard work  hard work low pay low pay good luck have nice day be safe."
bad,I worked for Honeywell 16 years ago. At the time it was very bottom line oriented. Leadership did not care about employees. Benefits were good but understand they now are lousy. Typical east coast company. Ivory tower mentality. VERY high pressure and stressful.
bad,Honeywell management badly mistreats suppliers and employees. They do not advance people. They seem like they are trying to reduce the work force in the USA so they can lower cost. They are more worried about saving money than they are about doing things right.
bad,"In my time at Honeywell, I was with a great core team and was given professional challenges that kept me inspired and motivated. However, this was contrasted with daily fears about job security - constant re-organizations and politics at play, with too many rumors to keep track of. It was very stressful. People couldn't function properly under those conditions. Eventually, I was terminated under an effort to consolidate jobs to South Carolina and Bucharest, Romania. It was a relief."
bad,"Honeywell relies heavily on its tribal knowledge but does not recognize when it is not common knowledge.  In particular, their Integrated Supply Chain group demands aggressive managers who know the internal paths to solve problems.  But they do a poor job of training for their terminology and systems."
bad,"The way the PMO works is that they develop process and controls from the inside and expand out to business areas without buy-in first.  The exact opposite is supposed to happen.  Management has a vision of making Honeywell the ""Apple of the Manufacturing Industry.""  Nice dreams but where is your execution plan?  As you work on projects, you realize nothing was analyzed at the top level.  The agile learning is presentation-based only and not hands-on despite a ton of feedback from employees.  The workplace culture is nothing special as everyone is too busy to even talk.  Working during lunch is common.  At the Morris Plains office, the office seating is first-come, first served.  There are NO reserved desks for employees.  In regards to facilities, the maintenance team has women working in male bathrooms and male gym locker rooms.  If the reverse was the case, this would be a big problem.  This is one of the worst run buildings I've ever worked in regards to facilities."
bad,"Moral is terrible everywhere on campus. If you don't kiss you know what, you get poor raises, or nothing. Your are not graded on your work, but if you are in with management, you get treated better. Good ole boy network style. No advancement, dead end. New hires who have not even proven themselves, are paid 10-15 percent more than long timers."
bad,Too long ago. I was there for only 1 year. The unit I was at was dissolved. I do not have much knowledge of how company is doing. Limited presence in bay area.
bad,wasn't for me the pay was low also not a lot of things to do wasn't something i could wake up to n be happy to say thats my job just wasn't for me.....
bad,"You will work 8 to 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. They are pushing for 7 days. Great job if you have no family or life. Pay is fair for the work done."
bad,"I would not recommend working for Honeywell phoenix engines. The culture is not conducive for advancement, the attitude, for the most part is "" if i dont change anything i wont get in trouble."""
bad,"azienda destinata alla chiusura o delocalizzazione all'estero."
bad,Don't have anything to say. I don't have anything else to say. I had to leave the company because of a family emergency and I have not been able to get back in good standing with them since.
bad,"People are not open to change or new ideas or using new technologies. They fight change and constantly complain about it. Building is old with no windows. Many coworkers have worked for honeywell for over 30 years. There is “unlimited” vacation but they still go by their previous vacation policy where new people only have 10 days. The health benefit premium is high with a high deductible. Depending on your manager, work time is flexible and you can leave or work from home when necessary. It is expected that you work on weekends and night and get up early for meetings. Project management is terrible. Everything is always “late” and no communication from anyone. They also try to make their goals by reducing cost of workers and taking away benefits. People are promoted to their level of incompetence and promotions are rarely given. If you are starting out they promote you every 5 years."
bad,"Need to work with suppliers instead of condemn them. Several sole sourced items that should be farmed out to other suppliers.  Or, bring back the machine shop."
bad,"Company is more focused on bottom line than their employees. Safety is a ""don't get hurt and don't tell if you do"". But I guess it takes a cut throat company to make money for their stockholder these days."
bad,"It was an OK place to start a career at, but the upper management at this company do not instill the confidence that the best business decisions are being made. Extensive benefits but they're a mixed bag."
bad,"this was the worst job I have ever had groveport location "
bad,"As a newcomer to the aerospace industry, the learning curve is extremely steep but you start understanding it with time and eventually get it. However, management doesn't give you the opportunity to catch up and get to the point of understanding. Their expectations are unreal and do not help you or train you but only criticize and demean. "
bad,"Management is only focused on meeting their metrics. Working in Project Controls they are forcing us to take risks that do not benefit the project but help meet a monthly metric on cash, revenue and cost.  Recently the North America Project Control group was moved out of the Projects organization and into Biz Opps. Under the new management the process the send the positions to Mexico and India has started with a 20% reduction in force in the US and Canada."
bad,"The executive leadership team are focused on cost reduction and shareholder value at the expense of the employee.  Benefits have been reduced year over year, more work with less people, and a new open collaboration seating environment means not having a place to sit when you get in."
bad,"Not very much advancement here. The management gets changed frequently. Allot of politics, if you are not in the ""in group"" you don't get a raise, but do get blame. Average employee life is about 2 years, eventhough a few people have been here 5 + years."
bad,"Honeywell is still growing out of ""old"" corporate culture. There are times when you're working on something that should seemingly be easy, but you're hit with a roadblock that may take longer than you may be used to due to un-necessarily complex processes and/or a long approval chain. That seems to be heading the way of the dinosaur though - in my brief time here so far, it's already gotten better."
bad,Management turnover ongoing which led to non-productive environment.  I personally had 4 different managers over 2 years.  Also ongoing disruption with hourly workforce due to Company/Union disagreement.  Unrest and disorganization in factory operations led to inefficient operation.
bad,"Not there long enough to really know, was only there as a temp. did not work long enough to learn enough of the company. I only worked on very little of the assembling."
bad,"Long Hours "
bad,"Honeywell Analytics is an interesting company. If you get in good with your manager, you'll have a great career there. Easy work, little responsibility, freedom to come and go as you please, great yearly reviews and tons of praise. If your manager dislikes you or doesn't feel they can use you to make themselves look good, you'll have low reviews, lots of work and responsibility dumped on you and little to no feedback unless it's negative. They'll take great delight in tripping you up whenever they can and bragging about it to their ""favorites"". And every manager will tell you it's the ""other managers"" that play favorites, they're impartial....yeah, right. And the best part is... the management on the production floor have no real training on being managers. Favoritism got them THEIR jobs! "
bad,its a product focused and not people focused company as honeywell sells products which are best in their class so there is very less emphasis on people. Most of the backend jobs are contracted with 3rd Parties which sometimes pay very less money
bad,"pay was not good and they took away your uplift for the ones working on the ships away from home and you make the same as someone in the states "
bad,"Honeywell is constantly creating new upper management positions, while laying off  people in the US. There is way too much management in the company."
bad,International corporation undergoing significant structural change. Aggressive work place culture. Highly competitive. Good people in a challenging environment.
bad,"Poor training and support and no accountability for management . While the work is interesting, and growth is based on performance, there is no work life balance."
bad,"Started off as a great place to work and throughout the years seemed to get worse and worse. Benefits are nothing to brag about anymore for sure. Insurance, Pensions, 401K's hit hard. Furloughs and layoffs many times here lately. I loved what I done as a job not so much the people I worked for at times."
bad,The workplace environment and culture declined as soon as Honeywell acquired the company.  They do not appreciate or value assembly or support workers.
bad,If you are interested in advancing with your position this is not the company to work in. Management is terrible and do not care about employee concerns.
bad,Long working hours to meet day to day committments. Co-workers needs motivation. Management is too poor. The enjoyable part of the work is skill enhancement of my team members working under me.
bad,"Cannot comment on this question. I am an employee of this company and even if it has turned here for the worse as far as the work environment I am not at liberty of making comments at this time. I do appreciate that they have employed me for over 8 years, but the working atmosphere changed."
bad,"Don't let the name fool you, they don't pay as well as you think, and they don't care about their employees, they have no concept of work life balance - the demands far out weigh the rewards.  "
bad,"Lots of bureaucracy, and nothing moves smoothly or fast. Many groups working in silos, and the organization is very top heavy with management. The operation is run more like a bank than an OEM. The guys at the top seem to have lost sight that we build things to make money."
bad,"No support from coworkers or boss, they tell you to go ask for help of needed but they really don't care."
bad,"used to be great to work for, over time with leadership changes job is not worth it. I would start the day by gathering data from previous shifts, chart the data, email reports to supervisors, check call-off lists, inventory shop floor and plan, and schedule daily operations. Then give Tier 1 meeting for crew members giving direction and information, then would also attend Tier 2 meetings with foremen and other leadership staff members. Usually meet with Plant director and/or Value stream leader about daily output and maint. needs, attend Kaizens and Siops. All the while still attending to the needs of the floor operations. Also very instrumental in implementing BIQ (built in quality). Learned alot as far as developing leadership skills, communication skills microsoft outlook, word, and execl - still have room to grow. Every 18 mo. or so leadership changed, so to describe it I would call it flaky at best. Most of my co workers were hard working and once I found common ground it was very easy to get them to work together and turn our past due ottr hits into past news."
bad,"At Honeywell South Bend you are a number nothing more."
bad,"With the limitations in staffing at the Orange, TX facility, I am able to become a subject matter expert in many areas (Distillation, Process Safety Management, Process Simulation/Design, Process Hazard Analysis, and Pressure Relief System Design, etc.) and gain valuable experience in a variety of engineering disciplines (Operations, Automation, Supply Chain, Maintenance Reliability, Inherently Safer Design, etc.)"
bad,"furlow and layoff happens irrespective of your performance."
bad,"Workflow was consistent always staying busy"
bad,"Honeywell has many good aspects including a premium on safety education within the facility, detailed CAPA training, Six Sigma training and some good veterans who were with Allied."
bad,It was an ok job but was not long term as was only working for agency.Good staff that worked there and easy to get on with Co workers.
bad,My experience with Honeywell was not well as my job was sent overseas.  I do not have a high regard for Honeywell and the atmosphere they create.
bad,Honeywell was a typical corporate grind.  Employees are treated like numbers.  The only concern is if employees hit their numbers (performance targets).  The expectation is for employees to devote there lives to the company for nothing in return.  My division was always looking for ways to reduce the work force.
bad,"Administrative Responsibilities: I like the challenges and diversified day to day operations. Everyday is a different with learning experience. "
bad,It was very disorganized and too much politics. There wasn't much room for growth. Management wasn't supportive of employees.
bad,"a normal workday can be a very demanding, some of my superiors took pains to teach when not know what to do. but I must say I do not have policies in favor of outsourced employees"
bad,"Not good place to work and build career"
bad,"Great if you can get someone to mentor you. But they are rapidly losing all the best employees as compensation and advancement is below standard for the oil and gas industry."
bad,ok place to work its a job but I feel the bosses did care for its employees
bad,"nice to say ""i work at honeywell"". i cant say enough. i love it"
bad,"If you are lucky enough to find a good manager, Honeywell is a good company to work for."
bad,Meeting and growing new customer accounts. Flexable schedule to work from different office locations through out the valley.
bad,"A typical day included writing news letters for the site and headquarters' Website. Assisting with the company grand opening and interviewing workers on behalf of the General Manager to get a sense of their overall happiness with the company, and where the company needed to improve."
bad,"Very busy, not predictable, everyday brings a new challenge. "
bad,This company seems to prefer to employ and offer advancement to people of other countries and cultures. The hours are excessive and it is hard to balance home and work.
bad,"Low morale do to low pay at this company.  This is a company for the older generation.  The work is easy, consistant, and they cater to the senior employees."
bad,"When ifirst started it was a great place to work, when it was Micro Swich  once it became Honeywell the place turned for the worse."
bad,"Management under-estimates the workload put on hourly employee's they have no clue whats going on but want to control the job, and the scary part they dont even do thier job. The workload itself was a disaster because they rather let stuff pile in boxes than pay the right person to do the job the correct way.  I enjoyed my co-workers most people were considerate of others. HIgh Stress. Don't reccomend to anyone else. Job Security- well there is none unless you suck up enough and do the managers job. "
bad,Too many mandated initiatives. Upper mgmt disconnected. Work life unbalanced for salaried employees.
bad,"There is no fun .the management is below the average ,Do not do that ,do not ,,Do not that what we hear everyday .."
bad,"Temp employee for almost 2 years. HR even said they were going to talk to me about an opening for full time. Frustrating to get your job done when there were better ways to meet customer demands. Company did not make your daily activities easy to do. When there was a good idea to make your job efficient. The input seemed to not get across to management. Seems like some favoritism going on there too, in my case."
bad,Enjoyed working for company great management and co-workers.
bad,Goofing off alot and people in charge that should not be and lack of communication
bad,Worked at Honeywell Aerospace in MN.
bad,"COM and Benefits are average, management is snaky! Watch your back at all times"
bad,"Honeywell already became Honeywell. It’s all about billing and projects association. They removed everything for employee comforts. Whatever running is there only for high return on low and cheap investments. One thing here is for sure.. Job security is a joke here.... it’s apparent that if you are not having enough billing for some time, you will be micro managed and eventually thrown using possible and "
bad,Do not recommend to anyone who wants to learn and grow with the new technologies.  Job security is very low. The projects selected by the management team are not predictable.
bad,Honeywell has good pay and time off. The Management needs to be more in tune to todays technology and improve product offerings. The day to day work is bogged down with meeting to discuss meetings.
bad,Must have a drive for self accountability and have documentation for all tasks and goal results. Be able to defend desicions and answer for all outcomes when carpet called by leadership.
bad,"The company has decided to go mostly software driven engineering. "
bad,"Honeywell's mission is to please shareholders, not employees.  Due to the large size of the company, employees are treated as numbers on a spreadsheet.  It is tough to find mentors who truly care.  I witnessed plenty of blame placement and nepotism at Honeywell.  It was a tough place to work.  Oddly, I am glad I went through it.  The experience prepared me for the future and gave me thicker skin.  If you have the chance to take a job at Honeywell fresh out of school, do it!  It is worth it for the experience and the pay is ok.  But if you're looking for a better place to work than your current job, I wouldn't move to Honeywell.  Hope this helps!  God bless!"
bad,"not a very good experience. They are a very shareholder driven company and constantly focused on meeting quarterly sales targets versus actual customer development and loyalty building activities. Salaries are well below market and Their commission payout structure is horrible, commissions are paid 90 days after the close of the quarter."
bad,The employees watch out for one another. They are loyal to each other. The hardest part of the job was the constant fast pace and learning of new products.
bad,More than likely you’ll be hired through a temp agency and then laid off before you’re there for 2 years. They have to hire you after 2 years and would rather hire another temp then keep someone with experience and pay them more.
bad,Do not recommend working for the Building Solutions Division.  They are way out of their league. I strongly recommend not working for Honeywell Building Solutions
bad,They are constantly having furloughs (Mandatory) to please their stockholders.  Very little done to equip employees.  There was one instance where a person had just moved to Dayton to start work just to find out that her position was eliminated.
bad,"There are a host of global/US polices that just make getting things very hard.  "
bad,"If you don't mind constantly not knowing what you will be doing then this is the job for you. The work is easy but it is hard on the body as you are consistently standing for long periods of time and you may not be doing the job you actually applied for. Communication is lacking as methods of how things are done, is different among different people. A typical day of work is unknowing. You never know what you will be doing or not doing and sometimes there are periods of time of not doing anything or ""cleaning"" just to look busy. The only enjoyable part of this job in my opinion is the pay. They pay well but I don't feel like treatment of employees is very good. Because of the high turnover rate and nature of the job, you are a pawn in the game of production. All management cares about is their production numbers while trying to stay safe with good quality. Safety is important and stressed highly so that is a plus. Lots of frustrating challenges to deal with but if you don't mind that kind of stuff then you may not mind this job. Most people who work here are only there for the money."
bad,"Tough, unbalanced, unstructured,micromanaged, confusing, unrealistic, challenging work type. Would not recommend it to others.Tried but could not equate or fit in."
bad,"This was a good learning experience, pressure cooker, hard long hours with little management assistance.  Supplier relationships are stellar.  I learned a lot."
bad,"The company allows many opportunities to learn. Minimal supervision is a pro and con. Managers don't really know what you do, so it's difficult for them to know that you're doing a good job. Because the company is understaffed, management will hire more people before promoting, which becomes an issue because people end up leaving."
bad,The challenging part was long hours due to demand on the team vs available resources. The rewarding part was learning new technologies and executing in manufacturing. Job security is almost at zero based on multiple layoffs
bad,The work culture has changed.  We now have much fewer people to perform the same or increasing amount of work.  the new reorganization resulted in several personnel being let go without a clear path of knowing how to continue the work effort.
bad,Don't work here. They will take advantage of you and manipulate you into doing much more than what they're willing to pay you for. There are much better options out there.
bad,"No advancement, a friend group job, in which if you weren't included in group your job was expendable at anytime. No hire own and no raises, was told all this would be guaranteed."
bad,International company with significant opportunity to work across regions and functions.  Strong commitment to process improvement and best practices.
bad,"my review on Honeywell. good place to work. new manager was racist and hateful. previous supervisor was a racist and hateful person. some people like to sabotage other peoples work to get them in trouble and plant razor blades in peoples work area to induce injury to other people. when reported issues to H.R., they would retaliate against you. some people are allowed this cruel actions as they were protected by management."
bad,"I was hired as part of the bridge team as they were out-sourcing the department to India. It was sad to see how the long time employees were treated - hiring freezes so they could not move into another position, and left to be laid off or early retirement."
bad,"Within my first month there I met three different colleagues who said 'I hate this company, I'm just here for the money'.   I found out they were right. The company culture is dry and cold, everyone is afraid of being fired at any time. No socializing, only work 7/7. People reply to emails even during weekends and holidays."
bad,"Everyone in management is saying yes to achieving the goals but will not give the resources to get there.  Hiring suggestions are ignored and the mantra is ""find a way""."
bad,"I worked for Honeywell for 15 years and recently quit.  I relocated to a different state as part of a promotion and was to get a specific bonus each year, increased vacation, etc.  As soon as I moved, my bonus was cut in half.  Business directors and VP's are moronic and make unrealistic goals year over year.  Come to expect annual layoffs to make up for unobtainable business goals."
bad,"Like many American corporations, Honeywell has transformed itself into a company focused on short-term shareholder gains, with an enriched executive team and low-cost country employee base.  They followed the IBM model to push out older US and EU workers and relocate key contributor roles to low cost markets such as Romania and China.  Honeywell owns a tremendous portfolio of products and will continue to make money for their investors, but at the expense of their workforce and corporate reputation."
bad,"There is a large disparity in salary between workers and upper management. The average U.S. Honeywell worker makes roughly 52K per year. On the other hand, the CEO makes 16.4 million a year. To fund projects workers are forced to take furloughs. "
bad,"Not a place I would recommend to work. Everyone is afraid of losing their jobs, and therefore very insecure. A typical day is stressful, and fast paced. The hardest part of the job is working in silos and being uninformed. The most enjoyable part is the awesome teams that try to get the work done."
bad,"No work life balance, very overworked and underpaid. No incentives for employees. I was once told by management '""Be thankful you have a job.""  I enjoyed working with my colleges and customers."
bad,"a typical day at Honeywell is just like any other plant, if you come to work to do your job you don't have no problem. But if you come to pass work on to next person, that preson day or night could be long."
bad,"Very high turnover at high level positions made for an extremely chaotic environment. No work-life balance, no training and depressing culture.  There is opportunity if you thrive in that environment can move up quickly."
bad,"heathcare  benefits are horrible.honeywell is a healthcare provider ,they bprofit from there own employees .deductibles are outrageus as are the premiums .they keep cutting back on our 401ks. 2 percent raises are the norm despite the busineses profits .new employees no longer will have pensions.this company keeps finding ways to take from the working force .31 years and the only reason im still here is my vacation time its the only valued benefit they havent taken from me."
bad,"worked for company for over 30 yrs.. the last 10 were at a location that was very stressful with no concern for the employee or the environment, only for the output."
bad,Takes a bit to learn all the systems and I'm still learning being on the job. The job is located in Southwestern Ontario and is multiple sites. Staff are great to deal with.
bad,"Like too many places these days, documentation on procedures and products required to get up to speed is lacking and personnel do not have time to mentor you, so you are expected to learn by osmosis. Management didn't seem to be clues in about was was going on and what was needed to support workers. After one of there projects in another division was cancelled, I was laid off because I was a contractor to provide work for a regular employee. I was promised a new job with higher pay but that fell through."
bad,This company has gone down hill and does not value their employees much anymore. Poor Work / Life balance. Management does not understand the complexity or time involved with work assigned. Make sure you are on the same communication wavelength with your boss or you may get poor reviews and be more susceptible to getting laid-off.
bad,"Normally work independent of other IT managing an offshore team in India"
bad,Worst part was people in high places making critical decisions about markets and processes with which they were unfamiliar.  Poor decisions led to a decline in our market share.
bad,If you don't have a degree but have lots of experience they will not advance you so your stuck at the lower level.  Most people have to wear multiple hats due to the lack of support or savings of not creating that position.
bad,"Work supporting is so slow.  No hiring and keep terminating position."
bad,"The people I work with are great, but the management wouldn't relay the concerns production had. Project coordination and scheduling was horrible with the ""just in time"" inventory method."
bad,"Cut throat HR dept with inexperienced do-gooders advancing or being retained due to throwing loyal more experienced managers under the bus. Overworked, no appreciation and most managers there are actively looking for other jobs. Employee morale is low and corp upper management has questionable business practices that their shareholders would be jumping ship if they heard about. You cant rob Peter to pay Paul as they say. Not a stable company to work for. Talk to headhunters and recruiters outside of Honeywell and they comment about how high the turnover rate is and how they do a lot of placements from Honeywell ex employees."
bad,It was a good place to work years ago. A lot of Back door deals going on between management and hourly workers. You also get forced to work weekends due to bad planning by management.
bad,It's been too long since I worked there. I don't have anything else to say cause I don't know the people that work there now nor do I know who the ceo is now
bad,If you like playing politics in the workplace and want to do the bare minimum this is the place for you. Hard workers and high producers are given more and more until they break. And then gotten rid of.
bad,Dysfunctional teamwork is an everyday problem. Lack of communication and indifferent attitude towards road blocks makes most of the challenges in the company. It doesn't have a universal ERP system.
bad,"I worked as a contractor for 2 1/2 weeks.  There was NO Training, and the software they use is ANCIENT.  Most of the employees are contractors who come and go so there is no sense of security or team players.  Everyone works on their own.  The buildings are old and not updated since the 50's.  I would not work there again."
bad,New intiatives started without proper planning and realistic expectations. More work added to already stretched capacity for adequate coverage of suppliers. Special reporting for key customers drains resources from productive work.
bad,"Compensation here is 30-40% below national average for Project Managers and Engineers (Electrical, machanical, industrial). I know this because several colleagues have left the company and received raises in the tens of thousands per year. Promotions are entirely based on how well you wordsmith you write up that YOU have to draft and submit, (some managers will help you out though). This is then sent to a board of managers that have never met you and they score your performance based on what you wrote down. Many people are leaving and they are having trouble refilling the positions (60% rejection rate on offers), so naturally we are all overburdened and repeatedly asked to work overtime. Overtime is paid HOWEVER, you don't get anything until you've worked 5 hours over the standard 40 hour week, then you only get straight pay. So we've got to give 5 hours of charity per week before we even start to get extra pay."
bad,Decent Compensation.  Benefits got worse over time.  Very poor management.  I worked at the South Bend division as a Project Engineer. It was a constant civil war between departments. Impossible to complete necessary projects. Would not recommend to anyone considering a job there. The poor management is why I left the company.
bad,"Industry challenges have led to many cost actions.  Unsatisfying culture.  Change in CEO could be a positive for the company.  Benefits have been downsized, working remotely eliminated."
bad,Hardest part of job is workload and prioritization.Safe work environment and free lunches.Supportive management and great co-workers. Satisfaction of job duties and growth.
bad,Since Honeywell stepped into UOP it's all been downhill. Management not really kept in tune with corporate plans. Shareholders run the ship. Cote will cut 90% of the labor force if it means he can save the slightest dip in EPS.
bad,This is a company that has a lot of great ideas and products but a horrible middle management. Too much reliance on offshore has resulted in substandard quality of products.
bad,"We did a job for UPS.The managers adopted UPS's policy of pushing just as hard as they could, expecting the impossible (unless workers cut corners and ignored obvious defects - passing them on to the next person)."
bad,"- personale ridotto all'osso"
bad,People there are great. I started there as a temp.  They usually hire temps and never give them a chance to bring them Full Time.  Love the Cafeteria inside location.
bad,"This company is getting worse and worse to work for every year. They add on more tasks and take away more tools that you need to get your job done. If you're looking to get experience then this is a great place to start, but don't count on making a long-term career here."
bad,"Culture is not what it used to be.  As with most corporations there is an expectancy to do more with less.  Lots of changes, too many reorgs, and lack of direction."
bad,Was an ok company until they were bought out by Allied. After that it seemed morale was down and people started leaving or were laid off. The management team seemed more concerned with their own careers.
bad,Honeywell is a nice place to work but the current management has misused and squandered away a lot of resources resulting in a rundown plant without the needed upgrades being performed.
bad,"Management had no idea what to do to run the contract or it's people.  Moreover, the management refused to listen to the workers to permute a better work environment and working conditions."
bad,"Of course, the job conditions depend on where you work and the management culture. My department at Honeywell was chaotic because management changed so often. Layoffs always loomed. One was always under the gun and no one seemed to be happy."
bad,"Company is not doing well and employees are taking the brunt of it.  Pay reductions, bonus reduction, no merit increases, work from home eliminated, healthcare costs increased and so on while instituting furloughs with no change in expectations."
bad,We repaired handheld scanners. When we came in all the scanners that needed to be repaired were already loaded to our stations. I learned how to program as well as repair the scanners. We never met with upper management during my year of working. My supervisor was a really nice guy though. My co-workers were really nice. I worked second shift so it was only about 12 employees on second shift. The hardest part of the job was not knowing if you had job security. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers.
bad,"The sheer size of the organization, coupled with the limited budget of the division in which I work makes the job of what we are setting out to do very challenging."
bad,"Honeywell is not a very good place to work.  Favoritism abounds!  Management only cares about itself.  No work life balance, it you love extreme amounts of overtime Honeywell is for you!"
bad,"Favoritism, managers hire friends, no advancement unless you become friends with management. 10 minute breaks. insufficient and hazardous work area."
bad,Requires to pay more attention to cultivating a better job culture and fostering a teamwork environment. Great people willing to help and to work with.
bad,You will be told you will get one thing and it will change whenever they feel like it. Very unorganized for a large company.
bad,"Corporate culture is very much stuck in the 80s.  No advancement until you've been there for 30 years, compensation is just good enough you don't leave..but just barely."
bad,The company would perform better with a new CEO on top.  Right now there is no focus beyond a 30-day term.  Benefits are scaled back and management doesn't have a clear path of success outlined.
bad,There is a lot of bullying and negativity in the office. They cut benefits and are laying off many people without explanation or warning.
bad,All jobs at facility are temp to hire but there has been a hiring freeze in place for most of 3 years.  Apathy is very high as the Cranston Facility is closing over the next year and scheduled to be completely shutdown mid 2016. I see no future here.
bad,An 8 hour day was standard.  The work was boring.  The best part of the job was working with my co-workers.  Hardest part of the job was interfacing the site in Russia and India due to the time zone difference.
bad,"Honeywell likes to cut jobs in the US and send the jobs and product line to LCC- Low Cost Countries"
bad,"Company operates in a silo environment.   Your on your own, not much support and heavily reliant on working virtual.  Your report manager rarely has team meetings.  People rarely share their work products and avoid being helpful with you."
bad,"The actual position that I hold at Honeywell is very interesting.  As I am the only Plastics Engineer and only Honeywell Certified Lean Six Sigma Blackbelt, I not only have my everyday job as an R&D Scientist, but I am always involved in New Product Development with material selection and final product testing implementing specific tests that I have developed for the company and its products outside of the normal ANSI, CSA and EN testing that products must pass."
bad,"Challenging position, not enough training to accomplish your job and not enough management to assist you when you need help."
bad,"I enjoyed working closely with external customers, I really liked to explain about their engines and reports I written about the findings. Working with project and develop engineering was  very helpful and I really learned a lot."
bad,"Good Hiring skills from management."
bad,Generally Honeywell is a holding company with a high degree of control over the children companies.  The talent and caliber of both management and employees varies greatly across these companies.  In general however it is very clear that no one really cares about your development.
bad,"When I began working for Honeywell it seemed like a great place to work. They had career advancement, tuition reimbursement and placed a large focus on the safety of the plant as well as the community. They used to push their employees to go further and encouraged suggestions and employee camaraderie. Sadly, over the last two years they have placed a much larger focus on saving money at the expense of the safety of the workers at the plant. At least 4 workers have been severely injured on site in the last 2 years due to plant negligence in their safety procedures. Managers say ""who cares, just get it done"". They no longer approve any tuition reimbursement or promote anyone to try to advance. They prefer to keep the hourly employees separate from the salaried employees and again, the focus is more on saving money."
bad,I enjoy my work here.
bad,"contrôle niveau 2, maintenance niveau 1, réglage machine, management d'environ 20 personnes, sens des responsabilité, prises de décisions"
bad,employer provide good benefit for workers.team work.productive and fun place to work
bad,"Productive very competitive, the work place and people were team players a lot of positive engery the ability to train others and become a good leader"
bad,The company has acquired another large company. Many managers not enough staff. The systems are multiple and do not communicate well with each other making processes cumbersome and less efficient.
bad,Poor management in the call centre department who do not know how to speak to staff. The use of bad language seems to be acceptable. Not professional when you're making or receiving a telephone call.  They let staff bully new employees. Has to be the worst company that I have ever worked for.
bad,"Honeywell is a very stressful place to work. The shifts do not pass on information to the next shift, so everyone is on the same page.have to fill out charts that don't really help with the day to day operations. I have tried to get a problem fixed for months, including going to the plant manager and still doesn't get fixed. It's always pass the problem on to someone else.Honeywell wants fewer people to do twice the jobs, in my opinion."
bad,"Honeywell bought us to remove the competition and talked about our product replacing their current offerings. This was followed by folding the worst parts of our software into theirs, and removing everything that made it special. They then proceeded to have offshore developers break everything. We spent all day fixing their bugs, and no progress was made."
bad,"While well compensated in my roles at Honeywell, I only came across one manager that truly knew how to lead people and that was not the fault of Honeywell but the goodness of that leader.  The culture absolutely stinks as you have to overachieve yourself year over year or you will he looked at as not breaking out of the pack and your compensation will take hits.  Many times I was made to force people into the “lower elbow” for force distribution and morally disagree with this approach!"
bad,"Honeywell is traditionally an equipment manufacturer. As they move towards a software mindset there has not been a cultural shift towards fostering a more modern workplace. In addition, much of engineering has been moved east making product development more difficult."
bad,"I was interviewed as site supervisor but that was changed to site manager on the day I started. I went along with the changes as I was promised long term."
bad,No training available for new hires.  The employees lack motivation to do more.  Leadership is weak and managers are not true leaders.  I enjoyed the talented engineering staff.
bad,"in the average company  Projets intéressants, grande autonomie et possibilité d'apprendre, salaires corrects."
bad,"Employees are friendly and willing to help. Roll out of any new system or enhancement lacks communication and training. Overall, culture is results driven, but the employee benefits are not great. Health benefits are costly and you are seldom allowed to work from home."
bad,This job was sold to me as something completely different.  There were some nice people and no consequences for the ones that were rude and disrespectful.
bad,The atmosphere of fear of job loss was rampid for all employees. They began increasing the penalties on occurrences of absence to a standard that was difficult to meet in emergencies.
bad,The work place was horrible the management were bullies no respect for the team members spear heading the company the pay was ok and the paid time off was awesome
bad,"I was excited to get a job here until I was told what the pay was.  Health benefits are the worst I've seen yet.  They have an annual biometric scoring of your body BMI.  If you are higher than the norm you have to pay Honeywell $ 500.00, If you are in the norm they toss $ 50.00 to your HSA account.  If you or your spouse smoke you owe Honeywell $ 500 per person.  If you don't want to participate they charge you $ 1500.00, and they say it's not mandatory.  This is ludicrous.  It's almost like people are paying Honeywell to work for them.  PS  I am within the BMI so I am not ranting because I was outside the limit.  I think it's very unfair especially for some people with health issues that are over weight.   You have to pay several thousand out of pocket before their 80/20 Health Insurance kicks in.  Although, Dental Ins is excellent as well as Vision."
bad,"Its been quite a while, I am sure they re-invented them selves several   times since. Allied Signal bought Honeywell Inc. back in the 1990's and took the Honeywell name."
bad,Had a nice time here even though it was cut short. I was let go off because i could not make it to work on an extended period of time because of minor surgery i had to have at the time. Loved the job but i would never go back management could have been a lot better.
bad,"Required to work 50 hours/week.  I learned a lot about jet engine design and maintenance.  Low pay, and very dangerous work environment.  Did all instrumentation design and maintenance.  I always did a very good job and a great attention to detail.  Good relationship with operations."
bad,Stay away no job security. Your just underwear to be changed out. Don't value any employee and have continued to cut pay and run moral into the ground.
bad,"Be prepared to work a lot of hours and even if you do well on their 9 block rating, your job is still being looked at to be sent overseas for cheaper labor."
bad,"Prior to my departure, the company experienced a downturn.  As a result, it seemed that every month there was a employee benefit being reduced (pay, 401k, bonus, etc.).  Since my departure, there have been constant furloughs and layoffs.  And many of the good ones left on their own.  After many years, upon leaving, I discovered just how underpaid I was."
bad,"Good place to start with but lot of politics in the management which blocks the growth of career."
bad,"Lack of structure and difficult to meet shipments due to component shortages.  The culture was connection of individuals who had long tenure and newer employees were left to figure things out on their own.  It was not a supportive environment and did not see employees as a valuable asset.  I really enjoyed helping and training others, staying busy, and involved in setting up new processes and being involved with my work team."
bad,"Leadership is focused on short term results."
bad,Moving people in and out on a regular basis.  People change roles too often and too early in jobs.The cost cutting culture is killing the innovation and growth opportunities
bad,"I handle escalations from customers through phone calls and emails. Metrics and reporting are done daily for my team and management"
bad,"Honeywell is one of those companies that you read about in the news  that sends many jobs to low cost regions for cost cutting.  "
bad,"In the beginning, everything is smooth going. You'll do training, talk about your goals, discuss what your manager envisions for you, but quite honestly, it never works out. Honeywell will sell you the dream of a better project, better work environment, better raises, flexible work schedule etc. They never follow through on them though. Most of the work is being done in India. All you do is sit in front of the customer and basically double check the work done over seas. Also expect to travel a lot. Honeywell will place you where the money is regardless of your situation. I have not been on one project where I did not have conflict with my coworkers. From what I can tell, all of the good engineers make contacts with the end users and go work for them, leaving Honeywell with a pool of problem employees. This makes it tough for new engineers to stay with the company because of the poor morale."
bad,I worked everyday with the same machine to bend pipes. I learned how to follow 5S procedures and use my machinery. I loved the atmosphere of the work place and the people I worked with. There was a lot of paper work but its all worth it to show your hard work. Morning meetings I felt were a good way to have everyone's opinions heard.
bad,"Most senior staff looking to get out.   Have cut benefits, no raises, multiple furloughs and layoffs.   Even got rid of telecommuting."
bad,"Honeywell forced employees to take 1-3 weeks off without pay, reduced pay and outsourced jobs to China, Mexico and India.  If you do something that your manager does not like, it is sure to go into your annual review.  If you do something that your manager likes, it may not show up in your annual review."
bad,A 5% profit year over year with only 3% sales growth is either due to efficient processes or cost cutting.... it's the latter
bad,"The Honeywell I worked for was #1 in the fall protection market before the acquisition.  Things changed after that.  Employees took pride in their work when they knew they were top in their field. We became numbers.  In the 6 yrs of the buy-out we became more structured, but the employees became less people.  20 yrs I worked at this same company.  Then one day my job was eliminated.  Downsizing was the explanation.  Honeywell does not care about its employees, they care more about capital.  The work force is compiled of 75% temporary shop employees with a 2 yr contract. They would much rather have their engineers and purchasing jobs out of India or somewhere out of the facility.  I devoted 20 yrs of my life to a company that the last 6 were the worst ever.  My advice... if your looking for experience, work here., but if your looking for a career you want to advance and retire from.... go somewhere else."
bad,"Great first company due to training courses on offer, but suffers badly from US head office interference."
bad,"A good place to work, people are nice and a climate control environment, good retirement job if you can get to stay there."
bad,"A great company to grow your skills and career.  The overall environment is clean, safe, and tells customers that Honeywell's a world-class operation.  "
bad,Management expectations unreasonable. No work life balance at ALL.  CEO takes and takes but does not reward the little people.
bad,"Very Challenging to complete all tasks and priorities given at once. Unrealistic workload for one person. Compensation is unfair for those in certain positions. No progression plan in any positions, if you want to excel in the same job title, you have reapply for the higher position, and interview."
bad,"The pricing department is a great department - we all work well together."
bad,"Company is really good when it comes to follow processes. Work is done disciplined manner."
bad,"When I first got to Honeywell, I had the impression of an easygoing office, almost airy in nature. The workers are all nice people, the task itself was simple to understand, and I fit in right away, quickly learning and taking on task after task, until I found myself being relied on for far more than I signed up for. I welcomed and enjoyed the added challenge and responsibility. I was fresh out of the U.S. Army, so seemingly overbearing workloads, long hours, and sleep deprivation were second nature to me. But slowly, they began losing employees, and not replacing them, forcing everyone else on the team to work 50-80 hour weeks. The increase in pay was the only good thing to come of this. I found myself having no outside life at all, working 6-7 days a week, and still having nearly impossible quotas and tasks heaped onto me. "
bad,"Always understaffed, creates a lot of scheduling problems. Very slow to recruit and fill positions"
bad,"Organize programs and establishe the most effective, efficient, and agile organizational alignment possible to meet current and projected program requirements. Analyze, evaluate, and make recommendations on the effectiveness of programs and resources against current and future Marine Corps and MCIA requirements and operational demands. Provide oversight in the development of long-range plans and strategies supporting MCIA’s mission, and the formulation and implementation of objectives, programs, and policies for MCIA."
bad,Big company with so many processes that nothing can get done or move forward. Managed poorly because too many functions are remote.
bad,"Pay was good, and the people and environment were professional. Unfortunately that is about it."
bad,"People were nice, but there is not a lot of management support of new processes and systems. Hours tend to be long and there is little time to take accrued vacation."
bad,"The name has fallen from grace. No Job security, continued attrition, no upward mobility, no appreciation of hard work. Most of the people are just waiting for their time to retire."
bad,"A fortune 100 Company, good to learn and grow awith, but rising real estate slumps is making Honeywell face the heat on profits and leading to heavy losses."
bad,Uma empresa que já foi boa. Ocorreram muitas mudanças que tornaram o ambiente desgastante.
bad,"Metric driven. Management only cares that tasks are being completed and boxes are being checked. Being a Yes person is the only way to advance, and challenging dubious decisions is frowned upon. Too driven by politics and personal feelings instead of overall job performance."
bad,"Essentially a financial engineering company run by accountants and profit margins...lots of outsourcing, more engineers oversees than in US now...continuing consolidation in US."
bad,Didnt really do what I was hired for. Not a very positive atmosphere. Wasn't trusted to do my job feeling micro managed. Many times was overlooked to complete a project and felt others were unfairly favored. I was more than knowledgable but ignored.
bad,"Typical day:"
bad,"The work seemed interesting but the company is still running like this is 1990s. You cannot work form home because according to them they was you to collaborate with your co-workers. Yet over have of my team was not in Golden Valley, we were spread out over Minnesota, Texas, Georgia and Canada. IT is not worth the money Honeywell is paying them (contractors only). HR is slow and generally worthless."
bad,"Although Honeywell had a great work atmosphere with great people to work with, it was short lived due to outsourcing. It was not stable and I always worried about losing my job which is what happened."
bad,"This place would not be a bad place to work, except for the mandatory overtime. It is impossible to have any real life as you are expected to work 10 hour days and EVERY Saturday. What is the point of receiving a nice paycheck if you are unable to spend time with friends/family and enjoy time off? It gets old very fast. They need to let people have regular 40 hr. work weeks and have optional overtime for those who want it. High turnover because of the long hours. I have just given my notice because of it."
bad,"I felt that the company was very unorganized and unprofessional on all levels. I was a temp so I had no opportunity to be brought on board full time. I was so bored that I reorganized and created a storage system in the warehouse for merchandise, and organized all the gear, boots, equipment, etc...it went completely unappreciated. I worked alone almost every day of the week and pretty much did whatever I wanted. I did not work in the factory. Fortunately, I was a good solid worker. The place runs pretty much like a factory underpaying hardworking and skilled tradesman unless they are in management, they take good care of the management team and their sales team. I feel really bad for the sewers."
bad,"The amount of work given could be VERY overwhelming for someone new.  The system they use is extremely large and complicated if you are not careful of your actions. The group I worked with were very helpful when possible, even with their enormous amount work responsibilities.  The entire plant resembled a tomb of walking dead most of the time; sapped of life and enjoyment, but people unfortunately stayed for the pay and benefits."
bad,"Very slow moving and ponderous.  Make the routine and simple, big events.  They  make the simple, complex.  Management is personal career oriented above looking out for employees."
bad,"Half the time at work was handling computer work - entering invoices, creating purchase orders, ordering supplies the other half was lab work."
bad,"Worked over 60+ week for over 10 years with overtime.  Tried many attempts to education upper management at the site level to understand the corporate projects and initiatives.  Maintained site to ""showcase"" level for customers, suppliers, etc.  And upper management determined my position did NOT provide value added to the site level.  12 years of loyalty and learning about the industry, internal/external customers, operations, systems, etc. just was not valued added."
bad,"Business units within Honeywell have little control of their own direction, strategy or staffing.  R&D is underfunded.  Innovation is stifled.  Rising profits and stock prices are met with budget cuts and travel restrictions."
bad,"At first, I thought working for a big company like Honeywell would be a good thing. I found out differently."
bad,No work family balance and had to take breaks and lunches after 4pm which made it hard to speak to my daughters teachers if needed. There was too many managers on one shift that did not communicate with each other.
bad,I had a love hate relationship with Honeywell. It is a team based environment for sure. Warehouse isn't heated or cooled. Work until the load is completed there isn't any going home on time.
bad,Not much going on at the company. Not a good tech culture for new comers. A lot of older people in the company who are only concerned about retiring. The benefit package is horrible.
bad,"Se manejan los principios básicos de la industria automotriz. "
bad,"Just a bit concerned about Job security and the Health benefits are so expensive! "
bad,The management pass horrible and funny promote from within often. Higher management is constantly changing asking with new rules. Tuition reimbursement sucks.
bad,It set up very aggressive goals regardless the situations ad resources.Creative isn't welcomed and voices were constantly being ignored. Everyone just wanted to survive.
bad,very little room for advancement unless you get become friends with management. Management is hired by friends which are even higher management. This particular HTSI contract is going down hill. Management can't get their assets together and lead a sufficient team to meet quota. just bad management all around.
bad,Honeywell is a fast paced work environment where you are required to multi task and learn new processes for your job. For example when customers have portals that you are required to use and updates are to be made your are basically required to learn on your own.
bad,A wonderful company with great work colleges and client base. The client relationships were wonderful to the point many of them have stayed personal friends.
bad,"let me use the education I got, & helped to pay for it."
bad,"Enjoyed going to work. Enjoyed type of work and the people I worked with. Worked with PC boards, prepping boards for conformal spray. The cleaning of bad spray was the hardest."
bad,"transition with the below   activities"
bad,"My company was acquired by Honeywell.  They shut us down and laid off all the employees.  Our products were good products before they acquired us, but they are managing them very poorly.  Our employees were all hard working, extremely experienced, did a great job, and did everything Honeywell asked of us, but that counted for nothing."
bad,"50 hour weeks are not enough to keep up with the work load."
bad,aburrido todo problema le cae al personal casi no hay apoyo al empleado
bad,This place lays off way too often! You either have people who worked hard or totally lazy people.
bad,"Empresa dinamica y funcional pero muy desorganizada, pocas funciones y objetivos claros"
bad,"Got brought in through a temp service which that was a joke on service and reliability. But honeywell was cut and dry. Clock in, go to area print pick orders/cycle counts and start. Occasionally have to look up item placement history to find missing quantity. Decent job for what you do"
bad,"Work challenging, pay good, benefits good but dimeninising every year. Treatment of long term employees very poor. Long term employees dismissed with little more than “you’ve been impacted” with zero respect for years of service. Also forced to take 2 weeks per year off with no pay"
bad,"Too much hypocrite behavior in management group "
bad,"Honeywell Aerospace cannot keep talent. "
bad,"I was working in commercial department wherein we were managing Import / Export, Invoicing, Debtors and Creditors management."
bad,"the job was okay management mot good Focus on the company and your individual experience while employed there"
bad,My whole department were informed today that we need to think about finding a new place to work.  Rumor is that they are going to sell Aerospace or move it to India.
bad,I loved working at Honeywell in the early years but felt very unsafe and dangerously undermanged by their mangers in the later years. Not well maintained or direction flawed by overall responsiblity toward the people and the up keep of the equipment.
bad,"Promote who they like not who is qualified. Leadership is more of ""do what I say and not as I do."" Shop personnel very knowledgeable but often overlooked and not heard."
bad,Recently aquired by Honeywell so lots of changes at this time. The people are great. Management needs to work on morale.
bad,Management were very critical of the engineers out in the field and will hound the ones that they want out of the company to quit.
bad,"Honeywell used to be a great place to work, but over the years they have taken away most benefits and put people in senior management positions that are managers and not leaders."
bad,"This job is more about meeting numbers than helping students.  You have to put the time in if you to be successful.  If you don't put the time in, you will not last long"
bad,"Honeywell, a place that you are very much micro managed from the top down you don't have a lot of say nor does your manager whatever is said is the way it is going to be. They do listen but it takes a long time to make changes. As for making you feel like you are part of the family at the end of the day you are a number no matter what kind of job you do how well you perform you are just a number. I have worked for other large companies and was treated better when it came to be told I was not needed any more they way I was told with HW was pretty sad it made me feel like I really didn't matter after all the hard work and long hours I did."
bad,the work i was used to was faster than here so i found the workload far to slow for my liking i like to be kept busy at all times in the workplace but overall we had a sheet of paper with the picks we took a pallet truck down the isles in the warehouse with a pallet attached and picked what was on the sheet then wrapped it the hand wrap placed location stickers on the pallets and took the pallets down to the loading bay ready to be loaded and delivered to the suitable locations.
bad,Electrical manager will create false hope to persuade people to work there. Will lie about job lengths and time lines just to secure your employment.
bad,"Its an ok job. Everyone was generally in their own world. People generally came in, did their job, quietly ( no talking permitted, no casual talking)"

bad,Ambiente lavorativo senza prospettiva di crescita.
bad,"The company has reorganized so many times and has over worked what experienced workforce it had left, individual employee cost reduction evaluation programs and company division metrics have killed employee and customer enthusiasm/ satisfaction."
bad,it is very hard to work in a company with no benefits at all except having the job . You are just a number. They don't care about their employees but  themselves. Not flexible working hours compared to my older employer which they took over. Very sad it happens.
bad,Debes de ser amigo de tu supervisor para poder crecer
bad,"worked at Honeywell Cheadle for nearly five years. No room for stock or for work space. There was a culture of nepotism by management I.E- lets give cushy jobs to my betting buddies. After falling out with my manager I was sent to work in the worst Dept. where Health and Safety was very poor. I breathed in carbon dust for six months,when i asked for an extractor fan, no chance. All i can say is some of these big companies talk the talk but rarely walk the walk. Think twice about share scheme i didnt even get the money i paid in back."
bad,"It is a very good place to work if you wish to enjoy your work."
bad,"Not too many opportunities for growing, neither for relocation."
bad,"Honeywell would replace anyone if they can find someone cheaper in another country.  it does not matter if the cheaper employees take longer to do the task, as long as they are salaried and not paid for overtime, the company incurs lower cost.  Everyone is expendable.  They eliminated working remotely, and in many cases it does not make any sense to have employees come to an office when they support people outside of the local area.  It is just a form of control."
bad,"great work atmosphere, great people to work with, place smells horrible and honeywell as far as a company doesnt seem to care to much about the hourly employee. horrible insurance. they seemed to find something to take away from the employee every year."
bad,"Company reinventing itself as a Software Industrial company, with a number of business spin off's.  Recent HR and benefit policy changes seem driven solely on shareholder value."
bad,"Momentan herscht angst um Arbeitsplatz. Viele sind von Stellenabbau betrofen.Arbeitsverdichtung,fehlende Wachstumsstrategie und  US Diktatur pur!!"
bad,They want the old employees out.  They keep taking benefits away and limiting resources.  filling in to meet 150 char requirement at this point.  only 6 more to go
bad,"Many challenges and opportunities to improve product and processes. Observed lack of work - life balance, especially at higher levels of the organization."
bad,"Okay Place to work"
bad,"No much to say, just that the company did not met my expectations, good compensation, but hard to advance the career, some folks do not have team work culture."
bad,Shift work assembling electrical meter. Management were easy going and understanding. Learnt about team work and importance of working closely as a team.
bad,Lot of work. No work/life balance. Managers are rude. No opportunities for promotions. Boring work. No hikes in salary. Company also not in good position.
bad,"Sistema HOS hace que los metricos de la empresa sean claros para el seguimiento."
bad,"The company pinches every penny at the lower levels of the company, while rewarding those that have little knowledge of how the business actually works."
bad,"process oriented, very less pay and bad perks. Takes care of employees but very bad pay masters. career is almost stagnant. adopts new technologies quickly and provides good scope for learning."
bad,"The scope for learning is very low. "
bad,"A great place to work if you do not mind uncertainties, Stress levels are low until management gets caught not doing their job. Poor planning and solutions are ignored unless they come from certain people. People pick and choose who they will work for and how much energy they will use to get the job done."
bad,Team Building and Business Growth. Opportunities for Self Learning and Personalty Development.Proactive Planner and Integrative thinker.
bad,"At least not for too long.  Despite the Honeywell hype this division is not healthy in terms of career advancement, job satisfaction, work environment, and belief in top level leadership.  "
bad,"Customer Service Rep                                                     "
bad,Company had been trying to get a contract renewed before I was to go over seas and didn't get it renewed till after I had been over seas for about 2 months. The management was not telling us anything on what was going on.
bad,"Been employed there way to long. Company does not care for their employees. No medical, no raises, no incentive. Just trying to retire out."
bad,Even though Honeywell in general is obviously a well managed corporation the facility at Columbus was not. I have nothing more to say about this company.
bad,Decent company but work atmosphere wasn't pleasant. Not much support from management and no encouragement to progress within the company.
bad,"The Torrance site for Honeywell Aero is currently needing to either be turned around and re-purposed or consolidated and moved to another, lower cost manufacturing location. Average workforce age is hovering around 50 yrs old. Most employees are looking toward retirement and not enthusiastic about change and adapting to new production methods."
bad,co-workers were great. i learned that managers are confused.
bad,"Very physical labor requiring great attention to detail."
bad,"	Final approval for manufacturing according to blue print specifications"
bad,Fair place to work.  Safety is the number one priority.  International travel.
bad,"I learned basic intrustions in my role as a buyer, was only employed for three months until I was recruited my distribution."
bad,It ended too soon. Unfortunately our building was demolished so a hospital could make a parking lot.
bad,Very structured and hard to advance in career. Company doesn't give much importance to employees.
bad,"After COM DEV was bought by Honeywell in 2016, within two years, the company laid off over 50% of the workforce here.  Increasing shareholders' profit is prevailing over maintaining customers' satisfaction."
bad,Management keeps changing and not a stable company for salespeople. Only big shots grow. Management is weak and not a good company for fresher. Brand is good but not products.
bad,"Easy work, old school work ethics and a harsh working environment defines Honeywell. Pay is great but the hazards that you are exposed to are as well. This is a young man's work place."
bad,"not rushed to do work,safety first environment . benefits got worse as years went on. was great learning chemical wise and safety wise."
bad,"Honeywell Int. is an excellent company to work for with many benefits for its employees depending upon which sector you are working in. In 2010 I was injured on the job and was treated well. While on light duty restriction I was given opportunities to work in other areas of the plant which resulted in my implementation of the many teams and groups that enhanced the overall morale, efficiency, safety and further established best practices for the plant overall. I lead teams in developing programs and training for other plant members in which the eventual outcome was an increase in quality with better cost-effectiveness while improving the safety practices of the plant all around. During this time my supervisors assisted me with obtaining supervisory training such as Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma and other pertinent training needed to advance within the company. Unfortunately the plant downsized with the intent to eventually close and I was one of those let go as my injury has resulted in my permanent inability to perform my original function as a welder/tech/general mechanic due to the rigorous requirements of the position."
bad,Work did not typically require much overtime. Tasks and reporting were accomplished during the day.
bad,Oportunidad de desarrollarte en una empresa de continuo cambio y con presencia global.
bad,just a company lost in the direction to make a decision to change what needs to be successful. too much turnover and no concreate direction to change just good ideas never implemented
bad,"I have been with the company for over 2 years now and haven given it time, I have come to decide the prospects of progress and promotion do not appeal to me in this enviroment and in this field of work. I am still determinded to land my accountancy job and pursue a career in finance."
bad,"I have successful achieved to develop Quality product and to do my part to help deliver customer product on time.."
bad,Honeywell was a great company. Management was great as well. The pay wasn't what I wanted specially for a bilingual. Over all. The job is a great place to work in. But I wouldn't know how it is now.
good,If you have kids and a wife well forget about this company. Also the company hires grown kids and the hardest part of the job well listening to kids cry(CO WORKERS)
good,"Line Assembly , Small hand held devices.  The company has expanded to a larger facility."
good,Good place to work if you want a lot of overtime but no life outside work. Management was awful and unorganized.  Needs better management in order to function better and the workers will benefit from better management
good,Management is suppressive and does not accept constructive criticism. The company does not promote career advancement. Benefits were cut and vacation time will not be accrued anymore.
good,En esta empresa es muy comodo el trabajo solo que no hay oportunidad de trascender en ella los jefes del departamento no apoyan en conseguir una mejora economica para el trabajador.
good,This job was only part time - It was clerical and data processing along with filing paper work.
good,Work life is good but job security is not at all there and the colours are seen at the time conversion of contract to on role no human curtosy. Need  to serch a job.
good,"No one wants to be there, supervisor included.  Operators are paid a minimal hourly rate and compensated for exemplary work with ice cream and pizza instead of higher wages.  Meanwhile, due ton the efforts of the employees the company makes year over year larger and larger profits which only go to share holders.  The people doing the work are under compensated."
good,"Not the average everyday job, it’s laid back work but stressful flush by management all the time to get product done with lack of communication. Not a good way to manage business"
good,"Honeywell would be a nice place to work if it was more organized and offered better compensation for the intense work.  You are expected to work constantly with no support from management or any compensation.   There is no room for advancement, and work loads are so heavy, that you can't even move to another department because of the support needed.  Extremely high turn over, due to lack of management and professionalism."
good,"I have been with the company for 11 years.  I originally worked for Intermec, but then Honeywell bought Intermec.  It was pretty good at first but the current executive management team are all new and don't understand our business. It makes for a very tense and unproductive work environment. Moral is at the lowest I've seen since the takeover.I am one of the only few Intermec employees left.  They have been the first to go in the layoff's.  Honeywell has started laying off again, so I would love to explore other opportunities at other companies. I have been looking for the opportunity to learn and grow, but haven't been given the chance with Honeywell."
good,This is a defense/govt. contractor that doesn't have to worry about industry competition and with no incentive in improving processes or investing in manufacturing equipment.  A lot of talented people on the production floor that are not used efficiently.
good,I will not recommned anyone to work in Honeywell as my previous company was very professional in people managemnet. Honeywell  company is biased in managing people. The Leadership is very weak as people in higher managemnt are not qualified to take up the role.
good,No professionalism in my team. HR doesn't help employee. They are doggies of management. Management want us to work more than 9hrs and dont want to pay for it. They personally target us if we raise any issue towards HR and HR is like doggie of them. My worse experience in my corrier
good,"* A typical day at work: Dealing with delayed orders to wholesalers in Germany"
good,"the upper management could work better on communication skills with employees."
good,Honeywell allowed for me to grow and improve my craft.  There is never the same day twice.  This eliminates being board during working hours.
good,"I love working in the commercial avionics dept. Co-workers were great, money OK, but health insurance stinks. Higher management didn't recognize the people that actually work on the product, they were too busy with going overboard with every aspect of HOS, to the point of ridiculousness."
good,"Fellow employees are amazing, from maintenance to management to the scientist."
good,"Most of the jobs had already been shipped out and my job was one of the last to go. I would show up for work, read blue prints for the job, set up the production line and then proceed with the assembly procedures until the job was finished."
good,No Benefits!  Sick leave comes out of your paycheck.  1 minute late and you are consider unauthorized.  No communication
good,"Old school, internally focused, slow to respond to changing markets."
good,Job was extremely hectic and stressful.  Worked approximately 60 hour per week and never caught up.  Handled and resolved issues all day long.  Too many meetings which took a huge chunk out of your work day.
good,"Very little direction given for job responsibilities. Scope of job changes all the time. Leadership makes decisions that look good on paper, but very rarely work out for the better."
good,"HON is really good at buying smaller companies. It's not very good at incorporating those ""new hires"" - because HON is a giant kludge of companies, there's no real corporate culture to speak of. Very waterfall-type product development cycles. Other groups underwent forced furloughs to make the bottom line look good. I worked with some good people who were otherwise discouraged by lack of resources, and lack of confidence in their job security."
good,Your co-workers will be the ones to help make it through a work day or project. Upper management seemed to be mostly concerned with turning a profit/remaining in budget at whatever means necessary-when it is a R&D facility tasked with creating the unknown and safety should be pinnacle. The spirit of what was Bendix is long dead now.
good,"Good company, but lack career growth and development. Benefits are ok, high deductibles, yet FMLA leaves are hard to get approved. Incoming parts are roll coaster of waves so hard to get steady pace of work."
good,It was just a job. I wasn't paid for my knowledge. The location was ok. The people were nice. The managers were never there so it wasn't stressful until they came in.
good,"Micro-managed and metrics focused. You are PM Micro-managed, and not really respected. Long hours for every Program Manager. All focused on metrics and not people focused at all."
good,"A typical day at work was competing #1 priorities on an ever changing basis which did not allow anything to be completed."
good,As with all large corporations Honeywell has changed over the years. From great to worse to downright crazy.. The management style is force and threatening. They did always pay me though.
good,"It is corporate minded lean management, and shareholder induced actions. The culture was stressful, The best part of my job was being able to take actions on my own without too much supervision unless it was a big problem that supervision must be involved in."
good,The company is great to work but main issue is with the operating manager and coordinators. Seems they are not qualify for the such job titles. As I have joined the company about seven employees left with in the same month due to management failed to pay them according to their experience and presented miss behave to the employees.
good,"No comment"
good,"Needs professional growth training for employees"
good,Indian counterparts are truly unprofessional and worst in terms of management.nothing to say more.. Honeywell building solutions in Pune Is the worst department I ever seen
good,You can only be as strong as your management but when management is uninformed and do not really care to be informed it is utter CAHOS! But we all know how the saying goes some people love to stay blind to situations because it requires change.
good,"I was able to interact with customers throughout the day via phone or email. The job itself requires multi-tasking with ease. You work from 2 computer monitors, 4 different database systems, instant messaging and email, responsible for incoming and outbound calls, & MS Excel spreadsheet management. Also, I was responsible for assigning tasks, coaching and training my fellow team mates. This position requires a great memory as you are required to memorize volumes of program information and trouble shooting codes while assisting the customer. It is an absolutely great job position, I have grown tremendously by investing myself in this company. I really enjoyed my position! I had a great team to work with as well! Everyone helped each other. "
good,I learned  lot of technical skills at Honeywell such as operating rate table and thermal chamber and inertial guidance.
good,"Very old chemical plant, difficult to get repairs accomplished, many labor disputes, too much red tape. Constant conflict between labor and management."
good,The area I was placed was not productive or organized.  I spent most of my days looking for things to do.  There were so many possibilities but as a temporary employee I was not given access to the programs needed to accomplish the work.
good,"was good place to work but team leaders management were a problem ,lacking people skills etc ,there attitude was if you don't like it theres the door attitude. did lean good things setting injection moulding machines etc."
good,Sub par company that is not heading in a healthy direction for employee retention.
good,"People in there don’t care what you have do to help them get the job done, they just want the things done, otherwise they just report you as bad performer.  As a contractor getting nothing for any achievement."
good,I don't recommend this company. They are hiring too many contractors.
good,"job was temporary, no review necessary.  Job good. Pay decent."
good,good co to work for but if you intend to get hired on permanently you'd be miles ahead to go elsewhere as the local HR people haven't a clue on hiring and would rather use temps.
good,"It is not a bad place to work. Only problem I had were several of the employees had problems with contracted employees for not being ""qualified"". Act like they were joking when in reality they really had a problem with others."
good,"Like in any factory  there  is favorites. They get  the good jobs  and can mess around and visit . The others  are being watched  all the time.  No positive  input  to employees, only what your doing wrong. Management has no idea whast going on in a daily basis"
good,"it's like being thrown at the wolves first day, there is no formal training, there is a lack of diversity and the management is poor. Managers need training classes!!!"
good,"Raises are terrible.  No matter how much you apply yourself, you will get an average review - unless you are a young engineer - then you stand a much better chance of getting favorable reviews and good raises.  To advance, you must be sycophantic."
good,You will be extremely busy.  If you love overtime you will have as much as you can stand.  I've never worked at a company were they spent so much on overtime.
good,No family time. Extremely long days with rotating swing shifts. Your life belongs to the job... There is no room for growth unless you know someone that knows someone... hint
good,Inflexible management depending on who the managers are.  Office politics can be rampant and training is minimal.  Communication is one-sided if direct manager is biased.
good,"After doing this job for 5 yrs and 3 1/2 with no help, i felt disrespected and not treated fairly about how they wanted me to change the way i had been doing my job for the past 4 years and the pressure i was put under to complete the work (of two people) daily which was impossible, whoever they brought in to replace me they're paying less and still giving him help. I really feel like it was age discrimination but i cant prove it."
good,"HR/ and Management are very poor. Culture is poor. you learn to never trust management. most enjoyable part of the job being a coater operator, also hardest part"
good,"I have nothing to comment about , I would not work for this company again. there is no job advancements. lots of back biting, management picks favorites."
good,"Worked here on the agency traveling 40 miles a day. job very boring."
good,Excellent Company as Allied Signal always worked extra hours 50 sometimes 60 hours a week with pleasure and a smile. Was always appreciated by CEO.   In the last 10 years it has become a very difficult place to work giving 40 hours became painful.
good,Good place overall can earn a lot of money working 10 to 12 hour days. Great place for someone whom is just staring out looking for employment. can trains and helps you grow.
good,"When you get an offer from Honeywell, assume this is the salary you will be getting for the next 10 years because raises are few and far between.   Also expect that people who have been there for years will do 10% of the work you will do and you still will get no raise."
good,Hr is very poor all they want to do is fire you Supervisors were always trying to. Find something to write you up for very stressful job a lot of dangerous chemicals Had  to work a lot of 18 hour shifts very good paying job though Very poor training you basically had to learn her job on your own
good,"Grateful to have a job, however, never know when the next lay off will occur."
good,"Its India office is mostly surviving on selling man-hours to its other global/ international offices. so working in global projects department is fun, but work culture in domestic business is very Indianised."
good,Each day the rules change.  The different business groups are not aligned and often have competing metrics to chase.  Very poor communication with customer's. I learned how to be fluent with the changes and tried to keep the employee morale up. It was a very difficult job with all the head winds that upper Management put in place.
good,"The manager was not qualified. He had no clear direction of duties, and and not sure of which way to complete the job."
good,Management wants quality products but are not willing to see that molds are properly cleaned so that they can get a quality product. Company doesn't want to spend money to properly upgrade or repair equipment.
good,"A huge company that you barely get seen. "
good,"Gloomy environment as the company is slowly declining. "
good,"Good company to start with but not for long time survival and growth. Good working culture however, no on site exposure. Hence, learning curve declines."
good,"Currently working in a technical support role, where management often ends up tasking you with work from other positions (document writing, training), while still attempting to have technical support as your main focus. "
good,"Your opportunity in the company depend solely on who your manager is and where your located.   Example is if your in a desired field they will staff the office with games, food, TV, etc to retain you.  Otherwise your left to yourself and very little incentive to better yourself."
good,it's a good place to work with good benefits and good over time year round. management could of been better to get things running smoothly but they still did the best they could to make it happen.
good,Honeywell is he best place for senior employees who are planning to settle in their life. There is no career growth and job security. Salary and other amenities are very poor.
good,"worked on reporting the same data on different reports to make different managers and directors happy.  Management only cared about making the numbers, so they could get their bonus."
good,"Honeywell bought out Sperian safety and slowly moved machines over seas. They weren't the best, but they taught us Kaizen and 5S."
good,"I come to work, say hi to the friendly people and then have no real work at my cube. Hours of sitting there wondering if one of these days you are going to be laid off or undergo another furlough since the company is falling. So beware to the recent college grads considering this place... because I am one myself and plan to leave by next year, I am giving a fair warning."
good,The pay is good but there is no balance in work and family. You must be all HONEYWELL and  family/parent last. They have some great people there but management is controlled by corporate office and you are just a number to them. They do not care about family but they preach and show you video's about safety and a friendly environment but once you're committed you see the truth about the process.  If I had to make a decision for anyone I would tell them to work there for the experience and find something better.
good,Good place to gain experience. If you are ok with a very large company. Really difficult to gain traction in your career as there are no real defined career paths and gaining support for your goals is difficult. But absolute loyalty to the company is expected!
good,"I work there one cruel lady no like me gad give me such hard time to let me look bad and loose my job"
good,"Working for Apache Creek was fun and energetic. I was honored to meet some great members of the golf course. This job was high energy however as the food section of the business is not a major percentage of the courses income, it is very difficult to advance."
good,"I learned about organization, time management and dealing with difficult situations in this job.  The department I worked with was filled with amazing people; hard working, dedicated, smart people.  The customers, both external and internal, we sometime difficult to deal with, but it alway taught me new ways in which to deal with these tough situations.  I became very good at trouble shooting and getting things done in a timely manner.  Although there was always something that you could get involved with to improve the company, there wasn't very much room to move up."
good,"Broad portfolio and trust given to managers, but little training on corporate software and resource support provided."
good,1950 working condition and 12 hr shifts using methods from the 1950's and conditions. not very organized and especially if you work 3rd shift. There is also no comunication!!!!and proper leadership
good,Honeywell is a good company for ou to join only to help you get to your next stepping stone in life. There is no opportunity to advance within the company and management is very poor.
good,"Long work week (40 hour),  Most admins take lunch at their desk.  No 401(k) contribution for the first 12 months, match is only 4% and 0% vested until completion of year 3.  Only 10 vacation days plus 1 floating holiday.  ZERO ROLL OVER, use it or loose it in the calendar year.  You get 5 extra days during holiday shutdown.   No MLK day, no President's day.  Health care is high-deductible.  Check benefits before you accept a position."
good,"fehlende Einarbeitung, hohes Stresslevel, Integrierung in Kollegenkreis schwierig"
good,"Fire alarem system"
good,"The HW way is the only way......whatever you think you may know and know very well, it is irrelevant.  Very much by the letter of the law and not th spirit/intent of the law.  Say this/do that.  Successes are celebrated at higher levels but ""unfavorable"" or ""negative spotlight"" will be the flavor of the day/month actions or responses."
good,I prepare documents in the  computer for the international and domestic orders to send them via UPS and Fedex around the world. Also I operated forklift to pick up the orders.
good,Select employees are treated unfairly.  The expectations to perform is often unrealistic.
good,Honeywell hum 7 day work week if you take time off for family they throw it in review your not doing enough ot you maybe doing a higher paying job for years and  yet your at a lower pay grade they tell you you will have a job don't send you to meetings the meetings where for people that was loosing their jobs to china they ask you and make it sound you will have an oppertunity to go to china they have you get your passport then turn around and let you go
good,"The management could be better, and the flexibity is horrible throughout the company."
good,Mostly call center work scheduling appointments and helping customers figure out what they need and what to expect at our education seminars.
good,iga honeywell is ok they need better dress code and the manger is not good
good,"Company was good fit at first. They provide onboarding training  and get you set up with computer. Work was slow at end of year and other employees contracts were not being renewed. Training then put to halt, no communication, managers are not being available."
good,"Workflow is  not steady at honeywell, and don't  care about  there employees and insurance they give us,they needs to  replace  management  to help save money  and add bonus to better companies"
good,"It’s a very dangerous job, someone has to do it. It paid the bills!!! Had to be aware at all times. Pay attention to details, or you can lose a limb. Employers’ are only concerned with production, at all about the numbers."
good,I do not care to answer questions about this job. Everyone's expectations are different and I cannot offer any insight on position or caliber of management. I have been gone for years.
good,"During my time at Honeywell, we launched a lot of exciting products and promotions. Unfortunately, they found themselves stuck in old ways of developing products and struggled to get out of their own way. Multiple years they froze pay increases, instituted mandatory furlough and took away benefits - all the while expecting more time and work from their employees."
good,The numbers are important. Daily reviews of operations' status. Prepare to grow faster and work hard for the benefit of the business. Nights and weekends are a necessity.
good,"Good Managers help team members grow and worst one will make you feel down always! Honeywell is excellent place to work, however it totally depends on your manager"
good,Great people to work with. Horrible people to work for. A lot of politics. Learned a lot about PM work. They didn't hardly train at all. No room for advancement at all.
good,"The good: Pay is great for the area. PTO, Sick days, vacation time and holiday pay begin immediately for regular Honeywell employees, (not for those from temp agencies). Some management is great to work with. You switch lines, so you do not get bored and it helps ergonomically. A lot of nice people to work with and most, if not all speak English. The company does background and drug testing, as well as random drug testing.  "
good,"Honeywell has extreme expectations of its employees. Workplace culture is one of constant demand from a senior management team with little to no employee respect and appreciation."
good,Your feet are going to hurt from standing up long hours. You have to be very punctual coming back from breaks. Weather is unpredictable in Nebraska so you might use up Sick time very quick.
good,The fact that this job was local to my home was good. The job itself was ok but the people were challenging. I like the work and the hours were suited to me.
good,I was a Integrator for my Boss . I was suppose to sure the product would ship out on time. I would go to a telecom each day to give status for Management and update SharePoint program on a daily basic.
good,"Long hours,terrible pay,poor management.Major slowdown of production door to poor planning by management.The employees there were stuck in their ways for so long,only wanted to do the least amount of work as possible."
good,"Good place, good people..."
good,People are not team oriented  union division very untrusted company between employees and engineers due to lock out and the company bringing in another work force
good,Too much knee jerk reaction to keep Corp informed of misses vs. working toward achieving goals and addressing issues. HR is a disaster with hiring freezes every 6 months. By the time you get a position approved and posted the freeze is in place before you can interview. Hard to make the numbers without people.
good,Decent pay. unlimited overtime hours. management and supervisors were ok. fast paced environment with quotas set every week. overtime hours always available
good,They are a great company besides how they treat employees. If you were a server in the restaurant you go no sort of pay out. Working 2 hours a day getting paid $2.15 an hour does not pay off.
good,It was an inventory environment. So there was no relaxing on the job.  The pay was every 2 weeks and I was a term or temporary employee. The job lost the contract and I lost my position.
good,"Reasonable job requirements that can be met, lacking stretch goals and standard job placement with little advancement. Coworkers are great to work with and extremely helpful. Management could use work and varies from department to department."
good,"Overall, I think this is a great company. I do think they need to have more standardized processes for newer employees. "
good,"Many meetings take up much time throughout the day. Meetings include schedule recovery plan discussions, corporate HOS meetings, etc. There's been a lot of growth in the past year, so much so the plant struggles with parking on a daily basis."
good,"Company transforming products, services and culture -- seemingly in a constant state of change.  Not easy for many to adjust to the very challenging working environment and complex business.  Sometimes insular in it's approach to problem-solving.  Over-used strengths in process improvement.  By and large, high IQ, low EQ of leadership.  Very complex and challenging work.  Leadership and Management is competent, but struggles to inspire workforce.  Workplace culture is not progressive or innovative."
good,"Due to the location of the workplace and the low pay, lack of overtime, and poor management the job became a chore. Our new supervisor was handed his position without allowing anyone else to apply for the job, he had no clue what we did or how we did it."
good,Its a job that is not hard to do but have to watch what you do because peoples lives count on it. The hardest part of the job is the different hours that are worked week after week.
good,"high stress,short notice on expected overtime and holiday cancellations.poor floor middle management."
good,"Provided technical expertise in automated industrial controls for sheet process manufacturing. "
good,Honeywell is a well run company driven on metrics and key performance indicators.  Corporate culture with high growth initiatives.  Heavy on processes.
good,"I worked as a strike relief machinist.  We were sent to Minnesota during the negotiaions.  I stayed there for over a month and never actually worked in the facility.  We completed orientation and training, then waited for the strike to occur.  It never happened so I returned home.  Great job for a single person who doesn't get bored easily.  You get paid for waiting."
good,"Honeywell can be a great place to hone your skills, but don't plan on making it a lifetime career. business volatility, coupled with stockholder demands for quarter over quarter earnings performance at the expense of future business.  Business decisions are made at the higher levels of management without regard to individual unit performance resulting in less than optimal decisions during business cycle downturns."
good,"Company Culture will depend on which location you work at.  There are some great locations out there, but the Colorado Springs Aerospace (now KBRwyle) office was not one of them.  This company is worth considering if you can gain some insight into the culture at the location you plan on working at.  Good luck!"
good,Environment with all needs to carry out research and development activities and continuous consultation with professionals at global locations. People enjoy who loves technology and passion for advancement in the engineering field.
good,I worked for Honeywell for 13 long years and didnt see much change in my salary. The management gets paid well but the ordinary workers still suffer to make ends meet.
good,I've learned a lot thru this company the reason i want to leave from here is just there are no opportunity for advancing and moving up which its something i'm wanting to do.
good,"Was a great place to work... for a short period of time."
good,A typical day @ work was to work with others. I learned many tasks. The management was okay. Workplace culture was great. The hardest part of the job was not having materials available. What I enjoyed about my job is to learn new things.
good,"Very cheap company, they even don't give free coffee and you pay your milk, sugar and mustard."
good,In my opinion Honeywell is strictly about making money.  People are laid off in rough times and CEO continues to make millions per year.  There is very little recognition for a job well-done.
good,"My review is that the Honeywell company pays well somewhat but the management do not interact with the employees, I have been working for Honeywell at the time and the only time I see management is when something bad happens or maybe sometimes some meeting we have and we didn't have a lot of meetings. No Christmas parties no company picnic,  no type of moral at all they need to interact with employees more and give better pay raises too."
good,Was a pretty nice place to work until they laid everybody off and sent the jobs to mexico. Btw why am I being forced to write this review? Just let me continue to look for jobs indeed wtf?
good,A typical day at work involve solving manufacturing problems and other processes. This site design and build unique RF components and antenna that does not allow for trial and error to solve production problems.
good,Challenging technically and environment enables personal growth.  Rewarding to see products of labor used to defend the country and ensure safe air travel.
good,the management interferes much too much at tech level trying tell the tech how to do his job.  most of time the manager does not have a clue as to what the product is and how it works.
good,"a day at work is not so good not so bad"
good,"lots of travel, lack of communication from management, lots of turn over . great company for stock holders. forecasting, pipeline maangememtn"
good,"bad company decisions, company is out of focus, VP make very bad decisions about the company and create a lot of working hours"
good,"This is only my experience at the site I work for not all of Honeywell."
good,"The position definitely enhanced my Excel skills."
good,Mostly hard working employees.  Looming lay-offs and constantly disappearing benefits create palpable tension.  Lay out of campus and departments not well planned or thought out. Layers of forms for more forms.
good,"Although they have good intentions to move in the right direction, it was still difficult to execute the actions needed to be taken to get the right kind of improvement.  Stuck in their old ways, it was difficult to get final approval on things.  Understaffed and overworked.  Also, there was minimal accountability."
good,"typical manufacturing environment . long work days with little or no management support , creating an uncomfortable work environment , and negativity throughout the plant ."
good,Very corporate environment. In recent times has suffered from over zealous approach to efficiency initiatives that have dented staff moral. Now is facing a huge round of cuts and redundancies.
good,"For employees at the plant production level of operations, the conditions are tough. The pay is good but the culture is very old school and closed minded. The site in Hopewell, VA is out dated and filled with hazards. Each day feels as if it could be your last. However, the pay is good and overtime is plenty."
good,"Had decent benefits.  When I worked there, management was in the gutter.  In 5 1/2 years, I had 9 different bosses.  I understand this has improved."
good,The company currently is not and has not been converting contractors to permanent employees. The lower level managers are good to work with.
good,"Stringent work environment, high productivity requirements with goals to be met daily, weekly, monthly. The co-workers were friendly & helpful, a lot of teamwork within the department."
good,If they put as much focus into they employees as much as they did their customers then it would definitely be a GREAT place to work.
good,Honeywell is a good company for permanent employees. Not so if one works as a contractor for you don't get to know the day-to-day activities with the project that you are working on.
good,"Met a lot of people and worked with many difficult customer service delivery of systems.  To learn an ordering system, I wrote a training manual for SAP."
good,Expérience en marketing sur des produits très intéressants
good,"The best place to work and good colleagues, work is demanding."
good,High volume with the need to ensure timely updates to customers
good,"I started out at this company 2 months after being laid off by a previous company where I had worked 15.5 years.  I had good desktop publishing experience, but it had been acquired using Adobe PageMaker and QuarkXPress, which are a good deal different from desktop publishing using MS Word, so I had a learning curve to deal with.  Still, I appreciate that this company gave me a chance.  Each day could be different from the previous one, depending on what was going on.  I might be doing nothing but desktop publishing for a proposal for several days, and then might need to design several forms and create a poster or large map on a given day.  My co-workers were all pleasant and helpful, but I felt a good deal of stress during my time at this job, and I could feel that others were equally stressed.  The hardest part of the job was that in addition to an unpredictable and often long workday and working weekends, I was required to complete Six Sigma training, including coming up with a ""process improvement"" project and completing all the steps of the project by myself.  The rest of the department had completed the same training as a TEAM the previous year, so each member of the team had taken responsibility for only a few of the required steps...I was having to do them ALL myself.  This, in addition to being sent on travel for nearly 2 weeks within a month of being hired, and also having to fulfill 40 hours of education annually (via my choice of in-house courses and/or college courses), on top of the long hours and weekend work, created a lot of added stress, and no real work-life"
good,Honeywell was taking over at the time of employment and there were a lot of cultural changes taking place.
good,The job situation goes with the economy neither you working 6days a week or 7days or you are threatened with a lay-off.
good,"Not a great place to work, management has lost its respect for what makes a company great, its employees. Honeywell does not fairly compensate its employees but upper management gets their raises and bonus'."
good,"Review and do production quote, solve any problem during the day."
good,"The Automation & Control Solutions (ACS) Division of Honeywell is driving the revolution of its business and the industry. ACS provides products and services that give their customers the power to create and control efficient, safe, comfortable environments. This $10 Billion enterprise offers controls for heating, ventilating, and air conditioning; security systems,"
good,"resumption time start from 8 AM to 6 PM ,and everyone must ensure to clock in before that time, I learnt alot during my stay in the organisation e.g on how to work on various machine and produces result this is one of the hardest part in the production flour."
good,+Duties given up front should be prepared to change jobs quickly.
good,I haved worked in a couple divisions of Honeywell so i can state whats good and compare it to the other division..
good,"Most of the workers are contractuals, however no job security or even career advancement."
good,The job itself was easy and all the employees on the ground floor were friendly and easy to work with. The company is going through very rough times right now due to poor management and difficulty in consolidating company assets.
good,Management would always replace the plant manager after a year or two. Causing us to change every time a new plant manager was brought in even if everything was running great.
good,it was a decent 2 years just had drama and management was not the best I would still recommend working there because times are tough and they do pay better than most
good,Starting salary was totally unfair.  I had a MS Electrical Engineer degree and was paid as much as a person there with a BS Electronics Technology.  I had to quit because I could not make ends meet financially.  I waited over a month to start the job.  I moved on made $45k more per year.
good,"Nothing to add except putting in enough characters to make it to 150 characters.  I am trying not to misspell any words along the way.  Almost there.  Now, there."
good,"Overall the work is fairly easy and reasonable. However as a employee I feel under appreciated and uncomfortable in this hostile work environment. Aside from the building being filthy and falling apart, literally, I feel as though good people and amazing workers are being overlooked for advancements  due to nepotism within the company."
good,Great people to work with at Honeywell.  Onsite fitness center is great.  Building is clean and well maintained.  Cafeteria is nice and reasonably priced.
good,"Very political environement at HQ level and they have no mercy/care for those outside of the center of universe (Phoenix)."
good,It is hard to keep both customer and company happy. Any negative feedback from customers immediately puts you in the blame. Do not feel supported by management. Lots of machinations in the background.
good,"Honeywell acquired the company I was originally hired with. After which the morale took a nose dive. The changes they tru to implement resulted in loss of employees, loss of already earned vacation hours, decrease in value and options for healthcare benefits but most of all decrease value of the employee."
good,"The best part of my day is problem solving and getting the units back up and running again once they go down.  I've learned alot about distillation safe work habits,  training new operators ,problem solving, loading and unloading railcars using sap to track inventory and raw materials."
good,"Exciting and important products for peoples safety.  Local culture is decent and talk like people matter, but can get over run by corp. mandates and reductions in force.  Leaving the ones with jobs responsible for others that have gone.  Really brings moral down."
good,"As is typical with large organizations, there are a lot of politics. Often change occurs at the top (such as a reorganization) which leaves employees in a state of uncertainty as to their future."
good,I really enjoyed the job itself. The management was less then helpful to say the least. My direct supervisor was not available most days and would leave me and co-workers to deal with issues that was beyond our control. In turn it did give me managerial skills that I could use for future employment.
good,If you don't have family in high places don't expect to move up. workplace culture is very cut throat. co-workers who have been in the company longer run things don't think you'll get help from management.
good,"HW no da oportunidades de crecimiento si no eres americano. Demasiados cambios estructurales provocan que pierdas tu historial de confianza y por ende oportunidades de promoción. Cultura fallida dónde se te evalúa no solo por tu desempeño sino por tus comportamientos. No tienes derecho a opinar, te limitan a trabajar como peón y cuando terminan de explotarte y acabar con tu salud, te despiden sin miramientos. Muy difícilmente reconocerán tu esfuerzo ya que para ellos es tu obligación dar el 200%. Buena opción para tener en tu CV pero hay empresas mil veces mejores. Es probable que te baneen para hacerte difícil conseguir otro trabajo."
good,"Honeywell is a great name to have on your resume but lacks growth in culture, work-life balance and expectations of goals. I would say that in order to attract younger talent and retain those professionals then a major change needs to happen within Honeywell."
good,Honeywell is a good company to work but still certain aspects of the job that can be very difficult and very stressful. Used working in a controlled weather at fireman this will be one of the most difficult jobs that you can work.
good,"Typical day started with stand-up meeting and planning activities."
good,"Bloated corporation that operates at about 10% efficiency while devouring itself with meetings, processes, review boards, and PowerPoints. An overall feeling that staff is counting days to retirement. Cost cutting taken to absurd levels such as running elevators part time or removing water coolers. "
good,"Best for college grads that do not know how a capitalistic company should be run..."
good,Strong company to work for. We seem to always be fighting from a past due stand point with very little repair inventory on hand which makes turning broken hardware very difficult at times.
good,"Stressful and demanding. Continually waiting on suppliers for parts, could be months before arrival. Overtime nearly mandatory when parts arrived to fulfill customer demand. Not uncommon for folks to work 50-60 hours on the production line."
good,"A good place to be to either start or end a career."
good,Long work hours and poor work life balance. Not very organized in Materials management and production control when I arrived. It has improved but they don't seem to do effective Factory Strategic planning.
good,I was a temporary employee for two years.  I was hired by a temp agency. They had some administrative cuts three weeks before my contract was up.  I was not able to be hired in full time.
good,"If you have a family or enjoy having free time on the weekends, this is not the place for you.  Totally customer-driven shipping schedule...required to work most holidays."
good,Company seems to lack direction opportunity to work together seldom happens. Too much emphasis on costs. Group was too scattered. No central location.
good,"Strict cost controls, RIFs, diversity of government projects, good people, lots of opportunity in PHX,                   focussed  primarily on avionics."
good,"People run scared to lose their job.  i tried to help production with solutions...and was told that i needed to follow certain procedures to submit to engineering.  the product failed as a result and i lost my job.  they use staffing agencies as the turnover is SOO high, which then prevents them from providing the support a true employee needs to provide the best service to them."
good,"They are a top-notch enterprise, plain and simple.  In general, the company focuses on achieving positive results.  They value intelligence and have a right and (very) fast culture.  The former CEO Dave Cote is someone I truly look up to (still).   However, my rating of Honeywell is only mediocre since, in my opinion, I was not adequately supported professionally.  Keep in mind, Honeywell is a very large corporation, composed of many businesses.  Thus, my rating only reflects my very specific experience within PMT and is NOT a criticism of the larger Honeywell."
good,"Salary was horrible for the amount of work you are required to do. There is no Management, and the culture is that you are left to sink or swim. Very little training provided with very little support."
good,It's all about the shareholders and the bottom line at the end of the quarter. It doesn't matter what you do unless you can affect this number by either saving a bunch of money that has been wasted or inventing a new mechanism or process.
good,"No longer allow telecommuting unless permission is granted by manager and even then it is frowned upon."
good,Very disappointed with my experience at this company. Was obviously a great company at one time but this location has been downsized many times over the years.
good,In india eastern part working environment is good u get the boost up in learner stage.In later stage you will not get any growth its very slow and you will not get proper benefit
good,"The pay is great for anyone in the production industry but the work place culture was terrible. Granted toxic workplace culture is every where and is not uncommon for manufacturing (in my experience). It's a constant old seniority verses new employees, I'm not sure about other production areas but this was evident in mine (cleanroom) but if that doesn't bother you, then this is the place for you!"
good,"I worked for Honeywell Controls for some ten years and found the management to be extremely poor. The work was steady but consistently poorly organised , poorly managed which meant projects fell behind and therefore you were under continuous strain to complete tasks after delays."
good,"Honeywell wasn't a very bad place to work but they were less than honest about the acquisition and future opportunities.  If you were starting out and knew about the benefits and opportunities and could negotiate them accordingly, you'd be fine."
good,"The management team does not let you advance if you suck up to them, this is in the Tucson site I don't know if it is the same across the board. I was not able to advance and was held back in mycarrer because of bad managment"
good,"Culture is cut throat, a lot of risk of lay offs. So people try to make themselves look better and others worse just in-case. My job is really not that hard just have to want to work basically."
good,a perfect place where you can learn and gain knowledge about process and all things happen in very define process. Work culture makes people to work better and grow.
good,Did not understand Federal sales cycle . Expected that they could conduct themselves like they did in a commercial client environment. Competition from like companies such as Johnson Controls and Schneider Electric was not understood to allow sales force to compete effectively.
good,"Strong and hard-working workforce, but senior leadership lacking in setting enterprise strategies.  Many changes occurring across the company so roles & responsibilities unclear across organizations."
good,"Too many people working on the same things,  meetings to plan for meetings, meetings to decide what to say on next meeting, too many turnovers, lack of commitment, ruthlessness and abrasive management style."
good,"The Typical day at honeywell is Good, Calm, Enjoyable,     "
good,I worked alone most of my tenure...learned a lot because of that.  Not a bad place but it was boring and could be slow at times.  Hardest part of the job was supporting many employees on my own from an HR perspective
good,It's all about the stockholders - and metrics. The focus is on working for 'free' - over 40 hours to get your EEI >1.10.  No regard for doing a good job or meeting customer expectations.
good,A company in flux. The aerospace group is in trouble but many of the other divisions were profitable. It just depends on who you work for and who you work with.
good,"Honeywell é uma empresa setorizada, tem uma cultura e processos burocráticos.  Aspecto positivo: alto turnover possibilidade promoções internas, se a pessoas tiver mobilidade para outros estados."
good,The only thing that matters to Honeywell is making the quarter.  No long range strategy as much as they say.   All business units/departments work in silos and no collaboration.
good,"Big company with many good, even great areas.  If you get stuck in bad ares life's not good.  With hiring freeze, movement between areas difficult or even impossible."
good,"Worked with some fantastic engineering and functional staff.  Too many changes with the new direction of management. "
good,"As with any big company, there are some issues with management, but the current management is steadily driving away the good employees."
good,"Tough to make job changes or relocate after being with the company for 5 years.  "
good,"Decent pay, but be sure to get a good starting salary as the raises offered are minimal to non-existent.  The company is stable, however, and there always seems to be projects available in addition to having good benefits and 401k matching.  "
good,"no processes, very stressful environment, always reactive instead of being proactive.  some coworkers have been like family.  lots of nepotism.  the work i do is enjoyable in advanced manufacturing engineering.  get to see progress in operations and building the product."
good,"The company has turned it's back on it's core competency and now has a serious identity crisis. There is no investment into the aerospace sector that was once the backbone of this company. "
good,"Currently in search for a culture change. Standard process continue to have a high overturn, no concrete practices of which evolves into management changes and high levels of constant transitions."
good,"Honeywell has pretty good benefits but does not pay their Supervisors adequately compared to the work expectations.  Typically, Supervisors are expected to work 10 plus hours a day and are awarded comp time but are never afforded the opportunity to use it."
good,"I worked for them for almost a year and rarely got to spend 2 days off that wasn't a holiday with my family. I had to cancel countless weekends with my daughters from Texas because I couldn't get off work on Saturday to go get them. As a contract worker I was expendable to them and they had me on a open-ended contract that had no ""contract to hire"" date in sight. Countless employees had been there for more than a year and still weren't Honeywell employees."
good,As I have been with Honeywell doing a variety of jobs and responsibilities for 20+ years it is hard to give a general review.
good,They moved everything to china and dumped over 400 jobs. Don't have much to say about this place. I was a great place before honeywell bought them out.
good,"Most disrespectful company toward its employees that I have ever seen or worked for.  All things are controlled from Phoenix.  Plant management is a joke.  Supervisors know nothing about the departments that they supervise.  Equipment is old and there is no preventative maintenance performed on it.  Company steals benefits every contract from employees.  This contract for 2016, they locked us out of our jobs because we would not succumb to their latest ridiculous demands."
good,"good company for beginners."
good,"Responsible for directing workflow activities for multiple functions in a production based environment, utilizing Six Sigma Greenbelt Continuous Improvement techniques to better manage time and resources while reducing inventory hold times and eliminating non-value added functions that do not support the customer requirements in the statement of work that applies to the commodity that I am assigned. The hardest part of the job is managing unionized employee base. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that our customer is the best prepared for any circumstances that are planned or not planned for."
good,"Very professional environment, good benefits and compensation for PR. But lacking in effective management of talented resources."
good,Good until Honeywell changes its company culture so fast the average employee has no hope of keeping up. Lower management and hourly employees have no chance against developing market employees inside the company.
good,"Working with scientist to chemist to engineers to site-op. very diversified functions throughout the site.  The work we do here on site is extremely important to the future the environment. Staff is wonderful, friendly and always willing to help each other."
good,"Too many of the crucial successes of Mercury Instruments were totally ignored; and, new policies were automatically put into place without analyzing.  These practices eventually let to the closing of the local plant in favor of relocation to a point in Mexico."
good,"Enterprise Mobile by Honeywell is a newly acquired company that supports the life cycle services for the ACS division of Honeywell.  The company is a bit unorganized and the management team is out of touch with it's employees. The salary is fair, but is overshadowed by poor management.  Your role is always changing with little to no training and a high expectancy of quality.  On a positive note, it is a full-time job opportunity, so you will get at least 40 hrs a week."
good,"12 hour shifts aren't great. No great raises. Plenty of drama in the workplace. No room for advancement. Doing the same thing over and over again can be a bit boring. All management cares about are the numbers, not enough about the people."
good,"Co-workers are friendly and easy to get along with management are very personable and helpful when asked. Continuous safety training, and great health benefits."
good,"lots of changes by management and never told of changes"
good,"8 to 5 day."
good,"yes, there is lot of work , i plc , scada , dcs , documentation , engineering , mcc , plc panel , client handling ."
good,"installation, commissioning of security devices, updating the project progress to Project manager and clients."
good,There is interesting work and good people to work with. The management will always focus on the customer and will force employees to try to complete the impossible.
good,"Typical day on the business side is non stop meetings and emails, fast paced and time constrained."
good,"- Choice of pursuing career as process or project design engineer"
good,"I loved what I did at this job,as I do at every job when I make it my priority. I've learned so many great things from this company, such as PCB assembly, surface mount technology, & leadership. The best part of my job was exactly that. I use to love going to work every morning, it was rare if I called out. My job was my life. My co-workers' were better than the management team for my department. With that being said, that was the hardest part of my job. When management was stressed, they were very unprofessional and seemed to take it out on the employees' and I just couldn't deal with that kind of stress any longer that what I've already endured. So, i decided to resign. Promises were never kept, benefits weren't so great, and raises were rarely given, even to those who really worked hard for it and had excellent reviews. So, overall, I'd say that this company is a great place to work,but unfortunately, their management team is their downfall. I am one of many who has left this company for that reason."
good,"Review my daily calendar.  Review as a team daily work activities and assignments, discuss any obstacles and completion dates to stay on track.  Review emails from team on work assignments that are abroad-out of state or in another country.  Work with other project members to discuss  and schedule future work activities and team support-align the right person to the future work and verify they are available during dates needed. Review budget on projects, 5S work area as needed.  Meet with customers as needed.  Detail plan projects and provide budgetary estimates to customer as needed. Work personnel issues if needed.  Deal with any potential hot issues as they arise as needed.  My position dealt  a lot with daily change due to numerous issues and reasons supporting other projects around the globe.  Every day was different with different challenges.   I enjoyed budgeting, planning projects and working with the maintenance team and occasionally  traveling  to other parts of the globe to support my maintenance team or oversee their work for quality, performance and improved efficiencies-is their a better way to perform what they did."
good,"The co-workers are the best part of the job, they make the 12 hour shifts sail by."
good,"Honeywell is a very large corporation so it is sometimes difficult to get the info needed to do your job. No real defined on boarding process. ie, here's your laptop, everything in on the website. training is lousy."
good,Assemblrd test board and permed testing on fitures to determined pass or fail function of componets to meet company standard.
good,I dislike using foreign labor instead of American resourses. Simple tasks are complex and sometimes involve mutliple individuals in differant parts of the world. Ordering a single spare part can take several weeks to accomplish.
good,Co workers are very friendly. It's not very much room for advancement. A typical day at work for me is doing my job. I've learned  to always contribute as a team player. The hardest part of my job is training and learning something new. I do enjoy my co workers the most during break time because we get to enter-act with each other and sat down and relax.
good,"I start my day finding out where I am going to work shipping or rec, there is not much more to learn unless a process changes. Management is laid back for the most part. There a good group of guys and gals at Honeywell who work hard. The hardest part of my job is standing in one place all the time. I enjoy the schedule we get weekends off."
good,"Honeywell Building Solutions, Fargo Branch can be a fun and yet frustrating work environment.  HBS is great company to learn Building Automation System technologies, but do to poor management it can quickly become an exhausting work experience.  "
good,most of the time you wont be hired you will be a sub-contractor and they will try and use you for all the hours you will work til shortly before the end of your contract and then they wont want to pay you the overtime since you will be leaving soon
good,"The average day at Honeywell consisted of a team meeting accompanied with group stretches. Each area had Checklists to complete before work could be started. Work processes were precise to every step. Every two hours we had a fifteen minute break, of which one we clocked out for lunch. At the end of each shift each area cleaned up and replaced tools to designated spots, then would help the other parts of the shop do the same."
good,"This company has alot of game playing with management, it is not about the product it is about the charts and alot o time they are not correct, there are too many senisitive people that have no business complaining about something, so they do so they dont have to work, the supervisors are liers, minulape, and covering there mistakes on something thye did so they have to take it out on one of there employee's, pathic is a summed up word for it. worked there 32 years and was accused of many thing so they could fire me. well deserved vacation. if you tell the truth and thye dont want to hear it , you will be unemployeed. i tell the truth so that why i dont have a job, would change it for lieing,"
good,We have the best Mechanics that get the job done regaurdless of demand. The major problem we have is inexperienced management and constant change which causes kaos and frustration amoung experienced Mechanics. I've always loved everything about Areospace work and look forward to new challanges.
good,I was strictly an Intern here so my exposure to much of the company dynamics was minimal. I did have friends out of college get moved around and only put on short term contract agreements w/ empty promises of permanent employment
good,I am glad I will be leaving soon to come back to the DFW area. It was not the job that I interviewed for and I spent the bulk of my time reverse engineering several systems. The work whould have been done up front but the employees failed to follow the company process.
good,"Intelligrated was great before Honeywell. stupid changes, poor treatment impractical realignment, bad decisions and lack of execution on plans.  I was laid off after 13 yrs, So others could get there bonuses at yr end.  No care for the employees, wouldn’t recommend"
good,"Overall it's not a terrible place but like any other factory you are treated more like a machine than an asset. They have zero consideration for you or your family and make it very clear you work 6 days a week usually and up to 12 hours per day for the first part of the year, then being asked if you would like to/ could leave early and use your sick pay or vacation to get your ""hours"""
good,Management was not professional. Human Resources was constantly involved with ongoing issues at the warehouse. Certain employees were given special care while many others were overlooked.
good,"I was given a problem traveling home for my uncle's funeral. Their concern is for deadlines, not their employees. There are ""clicks"" that would take years to infiltrate, and why would you want to?"
good,Shareholders seem more important than employees do...but it was fun while it lasted. Financial priorities drive this company and RIFs occur constantly regardless of employee performance.
good,"Wasn't impressed with how things are done. Too much corporate administration, which doesn't allow for actual management of your proect. Not a big player in the Houston market in regards to building automation. Because all engineering is done overseas, and can't be done locally, the customer suffers."
good,Not to bad of a company to work for many different departments and shift choices now which they did not offer while I was there. You work alot of overtime there
good,"Work was fast paced but satisfying. I was able to learn more about aircraft instruments and testing. Management was fair in some areas but not in others. There was some favoritism. The hardest part of the job was the long hours working sometimes 12 hour days, 7 days a week. But that led to the most enjoyable part of the job getting the my paycheck."
good,"gives opportunity to explore new technology and collaborate with other teams and business units, growth is almost zero. "
good,"Good company for people who want to work on documentation work. Good for freshers, good for people who just started his career in Corporate. Good for people who work in shifts"
good,"If you come in here with a long list of skills that you hope to bring to the table and move into a new position you can forget it. If you do a good job right where you are and especially if you work on an off shift you are stuck. All internal applications are run through your manager, not your supervisor, and if he or she can't afford to lose you then you are stuck, with no hope of ever moving up or on to a new position."
good,"good advancement, good people to work with, good work hours flexibility if you have the right manager. Employee performance process is horrible; they need to revise the process ASAP."
good,Excellent company to invest in if you are a stock holder but the profits were not shared equally with the employees.  High demands from management to the employees.  Constantly being pushed to work longer hours and increase stress in life while benefits were being reduced annually and salaries not increasing.  Intolerable work/life balance.
good,The company generally provides a good work/life balance with good pay but there is little chance for advancement and at times the work is mundane and time-filling.
good,"really bad management and stressful environment to work a typical day at work depends of the place where are you working,  in my case i've work in  ""rabbit line"" which is a production of gas detectors, I don't have a good experience with Honeywell"
good,"laid back job but they only hire temps so you can get laid off at any time. the people that have been there the longest get better opportunities and get away with a lot of stuff they shouldn't. Over all, its a good job and good pay, just temporary."
good,Management is something to be desired they only care about themselves the benefits are very poor but cost is high on them if you like working a lot of overtime this is the place for you. If you like working with people that only do the Bare minimum then this is the place for you if you like to work for management that only cares about themselves again this is the place for you other than that this is a great place to work
good,Exciting opportunities in a dynamic industry although challenging day to day and long term projects that create increasingly stressful environment. Great opportunity to work a diverse environment with multiple cross-functional teams across multiple geographies.
good,"I was a contracted engineer there, so I don't know how good/bad the benefits/compensation are for Honeywell direct hire employees. I do know that most of the engineering staff I worked with were friendly and helpful. Working with the labor union workers was... interesting. I got along with the union workers for the stations I was in charge of, which was great for getting my work done. "
good,"We have gone thru repeated cycles of acquiring a company, replacing our managers with the acquired managers.  Then imposing the Honeywell culture on the new managers and laying off most of the acquired workers."
good,"It was a good place to work, long hours but u get weekends off, pay wasn't that great, but the environment was good everyone work as a team and everyone hot along great...."
good,"Typical environment for a global industrial company.  Challenges with different regions and time zones.  Although organizes around common technologies, much of the actual work is still based on legacy markets or customers."
good,"They have constantly changing management.  The solution to every problem is more tracking with more metrics.  Learning, training, and knowledge is compartmentalized and tribal.  It's not an easy place to learn a new position."
good,"Current work load not in balance with personal file."
good,No through trainng provided..lack of management presence. Great benefits and compensation. Need more guidance or accessibility to well knowledgeable personnel
good,Decent work place management could be better and some of the more Sr. analyst lacked necessary skills. Work and life balance became issue at the end and traing was excellent.
good,Excellent workplace culture. Very interesting product line which created a sense of pride that I can contribute to delivering safe and quality products that affect all our lives.
good,"Aprendí a gestionar el payroll interno, algo muy útil y diferente a trabajar como provider. "
good,"if you like constant change? products and procedures/expectations are always changing. most changes come with no warning and only a high level explanation, never an in depth explanation."
good,Nice company to work for but it too far back to give a update. The workplace culture was good. The most enjoyable part of the job is gaining my Green Belt and Black Belt certification.
good,"Management get rid of those that don't kiss up to them! They are just now catching up to 21st century manufacturing: lean. A lot of management is for themselves moving up the ladder leaving behind them undefined work. A lot of smooth talking leaders in position. If you can talk the talk, but not necessarily capable of implementing or leading it; it's okay, because no one know - no one challenges..."
good,"Fast paced, poor management, great employees, Enjoyed my years at Honeywell but as business climate changes the company started to push training and profits above employee satisfaction. Was a good experience for me and I truly appreciate all of the knowledge and skills I gained at Honeywell but it just became too stressful if I was not getting audited there was a internal or external test to take it became non-stop all year."
good,"due to the nature of working in a wafer fab, it was hard to predict how busy you would be from one day to the next."
good,The safety Products Division is being relocated to High Growth Regions around the world to reduce costs of product development and instant access to potential new markets for sales.
good,"The work was nice, but not being able to have access to personal phone inside the facility was a bit absurd. Company has 0 loyalty to its employees. Overall, I wouldn't suggest the place for anyone."
good,"Highly famous reputable technology giant. rapid change of corporate structure organization and strategy. workplace is a collective group of mixed subsidiaries and business units at Changi Singapore which does not encourage inter-company interaction and leverage of skills, experience and value."
good,Es una empresa con mucha estabilidad laboral y las urgencias son el pan de cada día. Es muy importante improvisar para hacer que las cosas pasen.
good,"I was only a temp and I worked in the shop.  It was easy and repetitive.  As a temp there were no benefits, or paid time off.  Most of the people keep to themselves, sometimes the managers have unreasonable deadlines."
good,"low starting pay for entry level employees, healthcare benefits are very expensive and pay raises can be very low.  Depending on your supervisor work can be pleasant and some can be very family friendly."
good,"Contrato indefinido, Recursos Humanos no evalúa posiciones altas."
good,"The Honeywell corporation as a whole is an excellent business unit to be employed with. However, the lack of local management and direction left a great deal of unease and insecurity within the work place."
good,If you are a new grad it's a great place to move up fast. they outsource a lot of jobs to other countries. Upper level managers are not often polite or friendly.
good,Company unwilling to invest in its' people or technology enough to maintain market leadership role.  Seems to be following the path of other large companies by not focusing on its core market.
good,Lack of training on processes and on-boarding process.  This is not the best company I worked.  Very Poor medical insurance. The company only cares about Matrix and graphs. We spend  two much time in meetings not enough time to do the job.
good,"If you're an eager worker and want to continuously learn more, overall Honeywell is great to provide those opportunities.  There are many opportunities to grow and expand your knowledge in HR."
good,"So much work , we were unable to meet deadlines and everyone is leaving. Every other phone extension was disconnected, very sad. No answers for our customers."
good,"Management doesn't always seem to know what is going on. The workplace is like a high school setting, with rumors and insecurities. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting your work done and having an achieved productivity sheet for your company."
good,"Work and life balance is not good but it is good place to learn skill."
good,"I do not mind working hard and long hours, however, I was clearly treated differently because I was a female.  There were so many jobs spread to different people that I felt underutilized, especially based on my experience."
good,"1. Will start unlimited vacation policy in 2019;"
good,"There is a substantial variance across Honeywell depending upon in which division you work, your job classification, and the quality of your specific manager.  "
good,"Position I held was merged with a Corporate position,  thus making me expendable.  Loved it while I was there, completed my jobs on time,under budget, and perfectly but was told my job was no longer viable. Would I return if offered, maybe!"
good,This facility is heavily dependent on the local union and will actively negotiate lower wages on the national level in order to have a reason to go on strike and walkout.
good,"Havent worked here for about 10 years so obviously probably a lot has changed. I left my location due to relocation fears and due to lack of advancement or appreciation for efforts. They don't have a good overtime policy but expect you to work it anyway."
good,"No loyalty to the employee, they treat employees as furniture to be used and abused then Thrown away.  The only reason I stayed was my manager was awesome but the higher ups were NOT."
good,"This is a big company and your experience will vary depending on your department, project, location, etc. I have friends that had a more satisfactory job experience than I did. I was working crazy overtime and traveling all the time. When I decided it was time to move on, I was supporting a project that at some point I was the only team member, everybody else quit. The project could had been managed better. Honestly, I loved my job. Have you ever heard the advice ""Choose your Boss, Not your Job""? Well I learned the hard way."
good,"Typical corporate work day.  Lots of opportunities to learn new things, not a lot of opportunities to get external certified training unless its a job requirement. Not a lot of corporate perks like at other companies, but people are good for the most part."
good,The people I work with at Honeywell are great. leadership is weak. Loved my job but culture is to work yourself to death. Culture is very top down and political with an emphasis on performance metrics.
good,"I worked for HON for well over 20 years.  During the last 10 years, Allied Signal bought Honeywell and proceeded to inoculate it with the Allied Signal mentality--a version of the Jack Welsh/GE six sigma philosophy). They created so many new silos and built them to high it was incredible. Where people once understood what happened upstream and down stream from their work, they became to focused and isolated on just their metric that 'functional excellence' became 'dysfunctional excellence'.  It was all about numbers and Powerpoint presentations.  endless numbers of meetings briefing multiple layers of supervision what you were doing.  Many good/talented people left and were replaced by short-sighted dopes and wanna bes.  Lots of politics and butt kissing became the way to career success--and don't forget to change jobs every 12 to 18 months so the results of you bad decisions didn't show up until the next person had your job."
good,"Workplace culture does not empower the employee base.  Metric base culture where the metrics are chose for simplicity to measure rather than increasing productivity.  Result is that it severely limits creativity and ingenuity."
good,"Management great at delegating and work load is flexible to learn on your own, production floor staff very helpful and friendly. Engineers give great n the job training"
good,"Good folks laid back shop with mostly corporate problems.  Their biggest handicap is their requirement to get all job postings approved by corporate.  This results in taking 6 to 12 months to replace any position.  Most positions are not replaced simply absorbed into other positions which causes the loss of senior employees which in turn cannot be replaced.  Management team changes frequently, furloughs on a regular basis and get your money coming in the door because with even the best reviews you wont make more than 3% per year in raises.  Oh yeah and don't forget any leadership position whatsoever will require a 4 year degree with no exceptions made for experience. Apparently there are better paying shops with better benefits all over Tulsa."
good,The culture in the last few years degraded because of the vast amount of changes in how the employees were treated.  The focus became more in obtaining savings from projects rather than how employees can improve and grow.  The focus should have been a balance of both.
good,"Honeywell was a good company to work for.  My tenure at Honeywell consisted as a contractor for NASA.  Normally the work day was a moderate pace, but that would change at times within an instant.  This was my first occupation with a larger organization, and I greatly appreciated the professionalism experienced during the duration.  This position was my first introduction to data networks and network engineering."
good,"Here lot of pressure and strees."
good,"Short staffed but managed to meet daily goals, Learned to keep mouth shout cause no one wants to hear the truth about what is going on, The hardest part was keeping operators motived because of the inconsistency, The most enjoyable part was working with my people to reach /exceed daily goals"
good,"Good place to start your engineering career. You can advance if you push very very hard, otherwise you will receive nothing.  Benefits are lacking.  Work-life balance is good, depending on your role."
good,"Working at Honeywell can be described as competitive and fast paced. The salaries are competitive, and the benefits are adequate. However the company suffers from poor management structure.It has its positives and its challenges like most other companies. Overall, it is a good environment to learn and operate in."
good,"All personnel are treated like children. Excessive amount of ""Engineers"" who treat maintenance employees like they don't know their jobs. All ""managers"" are currently afraid for their jobs."
good,I am seeking careeer advancement. There is overlap of duties thus over manpower result in limited exposure. Present work environment and great team spirits.
good,"Your day starts immediately, sometimes right where you left off the night before. Daily duties always vary, but you know what is expected. Management is not really in your face which promotes a self starter work ethic. Have had the opportunity to visit an offsite plant to more fully understand the operation and issues that they might experience. The hardest part of the job is the waiting process for customer answers that need to come from other areas. Helping those with product questions that can make a life saving decision is very satisfying."
good,Honeywell is a solid place to work with average benefits.  People are great outside of some management.  Company would benefit from applying their own code of conduct towards it leaders.
good,"the training was extensive and through so that you are well prepared for anything thrown at you, questions are met with sympathetic ears and answered in abundance. always willing to help when they can. however overworked, overtime is almost mandatory as well is long days. poor time management and guidelines for work completion. i did enjoy the work for it was always challenging requiring to learn new skills to maintain my work load. learning jobs and duties above my title so better equipped to handle problem solving."
good,"Over all a good place to work for."
good,Company focus is no longer a team atmosphere-  What they say and what they do are totally opposite-  Management is non existent at the local level - The hardest part of the job is the multiple sites to get information - that is frequently incorrect -  The most enjoyable part of my day is when I am able to help others and see results of my hard work
good,"The aerospace industry has been through several bad years and Honewell's response has been to cut back on the things that made it a good place to work, namely insurance benefits, paid vacation, the flexibility to work from home, and of course, job security.  We've had several rounds of furloughs and layoffs.  They are also moving as many job functions as they can overseas, regardless of the impact on customer satisfaction.  There is a push to transition into the software and connectivity aspects of aircrafts and away from the parts and manufacturing side of the business."
good,Very busy and incredibly hot in the summer and very warm even in the winter. Must be willing to work at a fast pace with an even faster ability to pick up job skills .
good,You make your opportunities.  You will have to put in extra to achieve success.  Long hours are common.  The long term people are empathetic to your needs.
good,People training here is non-existent and they expect a lot from you. at times you have to go out and fond your answers with out proper guidance from management.
good,"Good company for people who are starting their career. "
good,Communication was limited. I only had one go to and she was always out of the office or working from home. Which sometimes made it difficult tomove forward until I could get a hold of her.
good,I have mixed views about my stay in Honeywell. The technology which my team was involved was kind of outdated and we were only supporting field issue with no forward development.
good,It started out as a great job with great people. A lot of changes occur after a year I was there. Management got worst. The environment was terrible. Everyone was exhausted and always fighting. It was out of control.
good,"The degree to which Honeywell is a great place to work is predicted on which organization you are working in, and that particular leadership team.  They vary from ""5 star"" to ""1 star"", and changes with time.  Company ethics are solid.  You don't hear much negative press externally nor internally.  I've been there for 6 years, and would overall describe it as just OK.  I've worked for better places, but also much worse places.  Salary is competitive.  Benefits are ever shrinking, particularly medical.  I've been furloughed for 1 week per quarter over the last few (three total) which definitely isn't appreciated."
good,fun people to work with but the management was a bit stressful at times. I found it was a boring dead end job that I was gaining no experience from and was ready to get out.
good,"Honeywell absorbs smaller companies into their conglomerate which have a little more compassion and interface with their employees."
good,"Messy. "
good,"My typical day of work started by having a tier 1 meeting that took 30 minutes to review what went good the day before. Safety and security concerns. Plan for the day."
good,"I worked for Honeywell for the longest of any of my previous employers and the culture of the company deteriorated over the time I was with them. I got a lot of great experience with the company, but the compensation is mediocre and the benefits were terrible when I left. They are in the hire the cheapest labor possible bent (ie H-1B visa's from Asia) but they still charge customers in the US exorbitant rates -- even though the Indian's are paid out of Honeywell Indian office at their Indian rate."
good,"Pro:  Procurement Team was involved with helping suppliers be successful for 4 of the last 5 years."
good,"->I have worked with Honeywell since Nov-2009."
good,Honeywell was a very unorganized company I have gained great experience from the company. I was a temp worker and I didn't like how Honeywell made the temp works feel the work load was heavy for the temps but the permanent workers were able to be loud and very distracting and didn't have to work.
good,"Good job, poor work environment, unsafe practices.  Talked with the safety personnel about unsafe work practices, nothing ever done about any of them."
good,Tough industry to be successful in. Aging infrastructure and high standards and expectations make it difficult to excell when key elements of success are not in your control.
good,"I started out as an engineer, and ended it in logistics. The company is huge and resourceful, and has a great potential for growth if you don't mind relocating every year or two."
good,"They are a good place right out of school but growth is not a thing."
good,"Typical day starts at 08:00 have morning meeting discuss daily tasks and safety considerations."
good,"the colleagues there were kind, helpful and fun."
good,"Typical day - too many meetings - barely enough time to complete everyday work requirements."
good,I was fine with everything but just an advice that Management still needs to improve in terms of listening to employees and make out solution by taking intiatives.
good,"Good Place to work."
good,"I was referred by temp agency A to company B which used me on a project for company C to provide tech support on devices made by company D, which were installed by workers from company E. Too many channels of communication led to many unhappy customers. "
good,"The work environment is intense and challenging.  Peers at low and mid level are generally very helpful to assist you in accomplishing tasks.  Like many public companies, there is significant challenge in managing the culture against board/shareholder expectations."
good,"It's not necessarily a ""bad"" place to work but it isn't ""good"". Work there at your own risk. You may like it, you may not. Best of luck if you try."
good,"Close knit group of assemblers, quality and engineering. Management seemed over his head most of the time. Typical day was building cables, checking quality, and building inventory to be shipped to sister site before shipping to customer. Started but was not able to advance with Lean Manufacturing and 5S due to lack of commitment to stay on task and remain focused due to  management. Hardest part of the job was always working from behind when we had a very scaled down group (from max of 10 to a min of 5, including management). Overall the job was enjoyable when everyone was working together towards a common goal. When management decided it was time to ""help out"" to get the work done we worked well together."
good,"Honeywell offers career growth and development and long working hours.  The workforce includes some of the best and brightest however there is much sacrifice and efforts made by employees who work for Honeywell.  While compensation is competitive, benefits have been reduced to offset the Company's expense while increasing costs to employees."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,it's non union and the rules change daily to fit management and the buddy system. The pay was good and i met some good people there.
good,Overall you will learn a lot about yourself and your limits.  You will definitely learn time management.  It's a good place to learn and to be challenged.
good,"Metric-centric culture.  High turn-over.  Poor work-life balance.  Mediocre health care plan (high deductible plans).  I'm not an angry employee.  There's just too much work to do in too little time and the pile gets higher all the time.    "
good,"I work collaboratively with my suppliers to find opportunities, with focus to improve metrics such as on time delivery, lead time reduction, payment terms, and price reduction. Daily communications with internal cross functional teams to ensure production targets are met. I work in a remote office among a small circle of co-workers, with my direct management being in global locations.  Managing $12M of spend is always a challenge, but completing a project and reaping the rewards is the most enjoyable aspect of my job."
good,Good Place to work. They are productive. Management Supports and motivate to every employee to work.
good,"Fast paced environment.  "
good,"Gestione globale del cliente  e collaborazione con agenzie di tutta Italia. Monitoraggio  backlog  clienti tramite SAP e consolidamento dati in Excel.  Controllo disponibilità prodotti   per determinare l’ordine di approvvigionamento ad eventuali fornitori esterni. "
good,"Great company to work for. Unfortunately as they lost the contract I was involved with, they had to let me go otherwise I would still be working there today."
good,"typical day starts with a review meeting and discussion goes for an hour for the previous completed task and further planing to work on & then we start working. I have learned a lot, mostly to do the engineering and minimize the cost & risk factors for future. Management is very supportive but never supports when its actually required, good for me so then I learned to manage by own. I find my seniors and colleagues very friendly, most of them are young and energetic. The hardest part of my job was the hierarchy, as I suffered a lot to find & build up in my organization. We enjoyed most when the project is successfully completed or any designed system got approval and acceptance."
good,Job Security - Average working condition - Average management.
good,"Its a lot like working for a unioun job, they are always negotiating contracts and are being bought and sold. when the work is done, so are you."
good,"more than likely about to teach this job to a monkey, very repetitious same thing day in and out. not challenging enough for me"
good,"As a former employee I can never say I didn't enjoy the work, friends I met through the years there.  I learned many job skills and have used those skills in other jobs.  I just have to say as I read these comments from others I see alot of former employees.  I can only assume you to were outsourced."
good,Company provides good benefits to it's employees and has a lot of processes with it
good,"9 a.m to 7 p.m some time late"
good,Work hours are 7:30 to 4:30 Monday through Friday.  Some travel required although with govt budgets being reduced travel does not happen often for project managers.  Honeywell supports quality programs but this location has difficulties at times following them.
good,Honeywell Cabin Management Division is a high end electronics communications company. State of the art manufacturing to suit all needs of the aviation customer. Although it seems that there is a line between the upper management and the manufacturing employees. 
good,Fast paced.  Challenging.  Developed increase Global management style. Heavily weighted to micro management at the executive levels.  Working level teams are energized and supportive.
good,Good place to work. Wide scope of learning. Scope for learning different business work procedure
good,Working rotating shifts.
good,Hard-working colleagues
good,pay is decent with the amount of over time but upper management is in shambles
good,poor management.otherwise good place to work.Terrible raises 2% on average a year.uneducated people running the place.good job security
good,Formal training and on the job training is irreplaceable. Expectations are many hours with little return for the employee. Business is under staffed and management is driven by corporate Human Relations.
good,Daily preparation to supervise in a direrse setting to foster teamwork among staff.Convery the companies policies and work towards the goals for the benefit of the company.Supervise co-worker. The people I work with.
good,"Met a lot of interesting people. I learned more about the Quality Control by classes and training. Management did not like it when they wanted me to pass a product when it was not in speck. No sign off meant that I was not letting it go and they sent me out of that department do to that. Other than management, most people were nice and some were fun and also hard workers. I have ADHD and at the time could not focus on test taking. Very hard to focus but did the best I could. Now, I am on meds and my focus could not be any better. Loved working in quality control because I love it when a company takes there quality serious. With the equipment they had to test there product in quality control, showed me how much it meant. This review was meant for TESSY PLASTICS"
good,me gusta dar el 100% de mi persona y aprender en todo lo que se pueda
good,"Casual dress, jeans everyday, ability to work from home. Resource management was not the best, there were individuals with Engineering degrees hired technical writers, and technical writers hired as document control specialists. However lots of growth and potential."
good,"I worked with the most wonderful people to date in a large company, difficult environment for accomplishments and opportunity for growth. Medium range benefits, accentuated by benefit and health care cuts."
good,"Honeywell Aerospace restructures approximately every 12-18 months. This causes tremendous upheaval with teams. As result, teams are not as efficient as they could since they are constantly restructuring."
good,The structure is such that the company philosophy mirrors that of the auto industry.  The HOS they use is centered around operational excellence and is heavily geared toward tier boards and escalating issues to the next level of management to address problems beyond 1 day of resolution.
good,"- Management is very short sighted, all about the month/quarter, less about strategic business moves and investments"
good,"Honeywell has many good points, and for most, probably isn’t a bad place to work if you have a good manager. Unfortunately I was saddled in a department with a terrible manager. He was their for 2 decades and the root cause for many to resign yet senior management refuses to see his shortcomings. Nothing worse than to work under a bitter divorcée with absolutely nothing better to do than work."
good,Fairly treated.sometimes favoritism is  showed when promoting  on reviews.promotions is based on yearly goals achievement?jot on individual sk8lls.The company takes pride in keeping employees safe
good,"Management does not care at all about employees.Almost no trainings, but a lot of travel."
good,"El entorno laboral dentro de la empresa es malo, no comparten siempre la informacion o se hacen los desentendidos que nunca se les comento nada o tardar en pasarte la informacion necesario."
good,If you got on with your job you were left alone to get on with it. You had 25 days holiday (which you had to take within the year) and you got bank holidays off too.
good,"Very poor leadership with no training and unrealistic expectations."
good,"For 3 years i been working on the distribution center ""DC"".  I learned pretty much everything from that department. For the last 2 years a new company came in. I have to learn new sets of skills, because everything it was manually."
good,OK place to work for a large company.    Always on a cost-cutting binge.  Very capable employees.    Poor benefits.  Arizona is an affordable place to live and a lots of sunshine.
good,Change is good but too much is chaotic. Told one thing and other things happen unexpectedly. Poor communication. Hard to feel security of job lasting. Too much overhead.
good,"Pay is good.  I enjoyed the projects that I worked on.  The layoff was a bit abrupt, but I guess there is no way to do it better.  The first level managers are good and care for the most part."
good,It was a normal 8hour day. We got three breaks two 10s and a 15 min lunch. I learned how to build with my hands. The hardest part is standing in the same spot for 8 hours.
good,Ok interesting  flexible good location good variety hours flexible change staff often many changes entertaining manh duties very busy lot of work variety
good,"Honeywell is looking for their place in an everchanging market, Their primary focus has become Aerospace technology. Their Chemical and Performance material production has become a medium priority. There is no middle management from plant to Corporate. High turn over with engineers and management. Due to changes in benefits the turnover of operators has increased. Great place to gain experience as every department is short at least one person requiring experienced employees to fill in multiple positions. Training is subpar as most is on the job and the individual/ individuals conducting training are constantly pulled to assist in other areas. This creates a stop and go training plan, difficult to remain focused on task being trained."
good,"I worked first shift with Honeywell for a little over a year. I really enjoyed what I did for the company.The work I did was  the process of quality checks through an assembly line process.Most of the fellow employees were great people to work with but with any job you have those that don't care. My issue was it was a little too far from home which made 10 hour days more like 13 hr days, every other 8 hr.Sat."
good,"Hard to advance. Says they are merit-based but more seniority based. Favoritism, gender inequality. Many people are complacent and it negatively affects the culture."
good,"Prostředí čisté, práce jednoduchá. Provoz 3 směnný. Možnost cafetérie. Jídlo v závodní jídelně průměrné, spíše podprůměrné, ale dotované. Podpora vedení průměrná. Finanční ohodnocení průměrné."
good,"Get comfortable with being uncomfortable.  The ACS & HLS group is continuously changing.  Business are being added, sold and closed.  I had 4 different managers in the 4 years I was their..."
good,"A typible average exit interview.  Felt limited in advancement. Environment was overwhelming.  Overall, this is a great company, just not an environment I was comfortable with."
good,"The particular facility I worked at just couldn't get anywhere close to their competitors compensation packages. Management is great, it's just Honeywell's corporate rules that really suck."
good,enjoyed working with the people there very dedicated group of individuals. Lots of turnover in the management that seemed to slow things down. This would increase downtime due to decisions being made.
good,"Don't get personal with any co-workers and watch everything you say and do.  Once opinions are made about you, they are fixed. They don't really want you to work accurately and quickly.  When you do, they take advantage of you.  Seasoned workers hate it when you show them up.  The culture there does not practice what they preach!  Its difficult and time consuming to advance or change departments and jobs."
good,"Enjoyed the work, but did not like the traveling. It would be nice if you could stay in one area. Helping customers is very rewarding. Management was nice as well."
good,"A day is seldom what you expect or planned. New ""urgents"" crop up all the time. I can start on a Monday with 3 urgents each of which are interrupted with 3 more and each of these with 3 more so that by Friday I am back peddling to get to the ones I started on Monday. Planning, preparation and timing are thrown about by the lack of these in other people. Management allows this easy going attitude so that there is more effort put into corrective work than new work. The culture is one of trust that is unfortunately abused. The hardest part of the job is having no support. It is promised but never there when you need it."
good,"workplace culture very good"
good,Not a bad company but this location in particular had less than par management and organization skills making the job more stressful than it had to be.
good,"Typically, maintain an understaffed division and drive up margin.  Most employees are fantastic, very driven and great at their job assignment.  Bandwidth is an issue as employees struggle to meet demands with limited human resources"
good,"As a project engineer am completed my work schedule with my communication skills commitment is required for every one."
good,This job is not for someone with a young family. There is more than 60% time away from home. The pay does not reflect the commitment that Honeywell expects from each employee.
good,"Expansive company with opportunities to move around, learn and contribute in many ways."
good,I am new to Honeywell and the industry. I got the interview thru employee referral and interviewed well. However it was difficult to get a good idea of actual daily expectations during the interview process. Once hired the expectations were much higher in terms of handling multiple projects and self-training on the job. But if you have strong perseverance the company can be very rewarding.
good,"la empresa tiene una muy buenas prestaciones y salarios, pero al momneto de los objetivos estos no van acorde a las politicas"
good,I enjoyed getting to know a few of the people I worked with and my manager was great. The benefits and wages were pretty good even at an entry level job and I progressed fast up the food chain.
good,Je recherche un emploi j ai été sur machine et préparation de commandes
good,"Business needs over employees overall needs and happiness."
good,"the financial evaluation of the work is not low. to the ratio of the work done"
good,"Management constantly changed direction on schedule development, reporting needs and structure every 6 months. The process didn't seem to help, but was always 100% necessary to whoever was currently in charge."
good,"Es una gran empresa, con una variedad increíble de productos. Como sus headquarters están en EEUU la estructura y atención para America Latina aun es limitada. Trabajamos con pocos recursos y alta exigencia, es un ambiente muy retador. Poco a poco la region esta creciendo y cobrando importancias. Mejoras continuas a nivel de beneficios a empleados (lo cual es motivador)"
good,The job task at HON is fairly simple once learned.  Unfortunately it takes longer to pick up the process as the training process given is not very good.
good,"A great place to work but mostly contract work with no overtime pay or benefits. no temp to hire, not considered as honeywell employee. great cafeteria."
good,"It's a trying time.  Many jobs are being eliminated and people are in constant fear for their job.  It makes for a very tense, stressful work environment."
good,Interesting mix of government contractor on one side and corporate America on the other.  The corporate side was really clueless of the requirements of a contractor and directives would come down that made no sense and the customer did not find value added.
good,"Company was a great place to work. All indoors, paid vacation after 90 day probationary period. Yearly pay increases if you met requirements for a raise. Management was amazing when I started, hiring department was in a hurry to fill a position and hired someone with no experience and it made it very difficult. Hardest part of the job was dealing with other employees. There was a very large age gap and it was almost a war everyday dealing with the older generation of employees. Culture was very diverse at this place and almost everyone could agree to laugh at jokes."
good,I was working thru a temp agency for over 3 1/2 years unfortunately the company shut down and moved out of the country before i was hired thru the company
good,"Every year you have to write your own reviews. Talk about a time waster. Then you are ""graded"" by your review by your supervisor. Shouldn't your supervisor know how you do your job. Not you telling him how you do your job."
good,"I was employed as a contractor, so I can't speak to employee benefits or advancement."
good,Managements were excellent and learned how to make workplace run more efficiently and cut wastes. Stressful working environment but worth for the salary they provided. Clear and standardized work
good,work temp at honeywell is not a good management is very poor keep changing policys every week something new to hear from the management and timing was not good yo cant balance the work and life
good,"For the most part the biggest issues I had working there was the pay that I was receiving and the lack of management... Too much of I don't care, besides that I have no issues.."
good,Excellent place to work. Learned new things. Very helpful everyday is new to learn. Amazing environment. Big company so it has few cons as well which can be ignored.
good,"- Most management isn't the best; doesn't really care for people. "
good,Insurance options leave much to be desired. Too top heavy in regards to management. Great stock options. Working environment  is draining due to poor morale/toxic environment. Annual increases are merit based and do not amount to much (do not keep up with increase to cost of living). Not enough employee recognition with little done for the employees by the company. Only get 1- 10 minute break and 1-20 min lunch.
good,"Wrote productive requirement specifications, able to learn business processes at different locations and able to help improve them. was able to learn the defense and space industry. Most people were very helpful and helped teach others the business and share what they know. Mixed bag of management, most had very good skills but SAP management was not able to keep projects on time."
good,"Work tasks were routine in my group, but each team member did their own things independently so the rapport was not great. It was hard to know what was important to the company vs. just another employee's personal preference. "
good,Ever since the acquisition of Honeywell by Allied Signal years ago this just aint the same place as the awesome Honeywell of Minneapolis.  Chuck full of stepford wives.
good,"The work at Honeywell was a stabile environment for an Air Force sustainment contract. However, the management changed, the government customers changed and relations were stressed. Honeywell did not win the follow-on contract. As a result most of the work force left or were laid off over a period of months."
good,Company has vision of transforming itself but put in a lot of processes in place that inhibit growth. Constant management and senior leadership changes don't help with the cause.
good,i do not have much to go on as i have only been working there a few months.  working there goes against a philosophy that i am currently attempting to live.
good,"I've been here for 5 + years and started right out of college. I have learned a lot about the oil and gas industry here. The company is undergoing a transition currently to be a leading software company so there is a lot of restructuring going on."
good,"Job is pretty good, compensation could be better. Management is completely out of touch with the workers and their interactions are based only on personal preference of employees and has nothing to do with employee performance. Bad employees that are friendly with management are kept, good employees that management does not like are pushed out."
good,"Great training, great group of people to work with. I like the relaxed environment, decent pay and good hours. Also close to home. Not so great at the problem solving in regards to miscommunication between supervisors when theyre out of town."
good,"I worked on exciting projects, but the hours were long, expectations were high and employees were treated like fungible assets. Honeywell prioritizes investors over other stakeholders."
good,I gained a lot of knowledge working at Honeywell. Honeywell's culture is to help their employees grow and keep up with Technology. It is a fast paced environment.
good,"This company was a distribution division and dealt with low voltage security products.Since the company dealt with the selling of low voltage security system which had other players in the market also, so the work was very competitive.The revenue achievement was estimated on a daily basis. Often required to work quite late in office as the market generally operated from 11 AM - 9 PM. It was mostly push sell. The service team was not strong enough to give support to the existing clients.The System Integrator s who were the customers were often unaware with the security system prevalent in the, so needed lots of education while selling the products."
good,"Working with Honeywell gave me the technical exposure and insight exceeding any expectation, but the personal experience was horrible. I was able to be part of test engineering and RF design teams. Management is not good. Many good Sr. Engineers left the company over the past year, leaving the site I was working in without experienced people. A lot of high pressure on younger un-experienced engineers. Recent changes on the company like SAP and ""Unlimited Paid Time Off"" are not as advised."
good,"Honeywell has never been the same since migrating from American control to Switzerland."
good,"1. A day at work would be passing easily with vast Aerospace domain knowledge in projects."
good,"productive and very safety conscious. "
good,Honeywell is a company that pushes you to expand your horizons.  There is a fast paced environment that focuses on education vs. experience and offers limited advancement unless a degree is present.
good,"Not a great place, not bad either. Totally depends on the nature of project and deadlines for a project. Can be very chilled environment and can also be very hectic."
good,Always ongoing changes. The hardest part on the job was that sometimes management did not know what they were doing. This was ongoing changes and learning.
good,"Starting process improvement,not sure if they are serious yet.29yrs Phoenix,Plant shut down but I quit before it could happen.Did other interesting jobs in the power industry.See if they shut this down.Pay good long hours."
good,"I love the people at Honeywell.  They are always looking for each other and it's a great environment.  They are also very respectful of when you need time off, though if there is a pressing deadline they will make you come in.  IT is set up so we can telecommute from anywhere, so it's not that bad if you have to 'come in'.  "
good,Working at Honeywell Metropolis is was a challenging but rewarding experience.  I would not leave the company if my current position wasn't being subject to layoff due to idling of the facility.
good,"Casual dress code.  Friendly environment. End of the week/month was hectic.  At that time, they were under staffed and over worked.  Many lost their jobs, due to cutbacks."
good,"The working environment is good and supportive."
good,"Honeywell was a productive and safe place to work. The opportunity was knowledgeable and informative. the things that I have learned was beneficial to my career. I am qualified in operational principles and practices, Inventory accuracy, document preparation, lean manufacturing, and SAP Management. I have applied my classroom learning and work experience to successful projects in which I was responsible. I have experience working with Engineers on different tasks and responsibilities focusing on developing new processes or upgraded processes."
good,"Typical day at work included testing and configuring mobile devices of various OEMs."
good,"Empresa engessada, burocrática, e se você não é político nunca será promovido."
good,Large imbalance between senior leadership/CEOs/stock holder requirements of employees and providing emploee considerations. Mgt expects loyalty but gives very little. Mgt expects committments and assurances from employees but gives none in return. Mgt expects salaried people to put in much more than 40 hours per week and at least one weekend per week.
good,Honeywell division I worked for was sold and left town. Employees were very friendly. the last 2 years no one got raises. Required to work at Schriever Air Force Base on numerous occasions. Never got use to teenagerrs running around with automatic weapons.
good,Collaboration with global teams is an every day task.  Very politically correct company with lots of management levels.  Outdated buildings and workspaces and expect to walk a mile to your office.
good,Many issues that need to be worked out especially the division between the company and the employees need to work it out. employees want things one way and one way only don't see them gaining any ground.
good,"Although working in Honeywell is unbalance & stress.but the company have offer other benefits such as flexibility & tolerance."
good,"Management is all over the place doesn't know about the actual builds . New employees need better training. Management lacks the right communication with employees one on one. The demand for builds increase but lack too supply tool. Habor Freight tool were given at time. Senior employees feel they can't get fired files complaints to H.R , it becomes hard for new employee to grow .some people have been there sense 1988."
good,"Some great/ talented people to work with.  Personally, I had some excellent managers to work for.  The overall culture is not conducive however for professional growth."
good,"Not a bad place to work. The work is easy and the atmosphere is relaxed.  The employees or lifers, all like the company and it is run better than most factories."
good,"I worked at Honeywell for almost two years. I was forced to leave because if I didn't, I would be laid off once I hit my two year tenure. They had a policy where they weren't allowed to hire people on full time."
good,Pay and benefits are not very good.  Raises are almost non exsistent.  Management isn't bad.  The job overall isn't bad.  Good place to get into the industry if this is something you want to do.
good,Travaille en équipe agréable équipement mal entretenue
good,"Well diversified, results driven company.  Divisions include Aerospace, Performance Materials and Honeywell Building Technologies.  Honeywell Building Solutions is a well-run division."
good,"Overall Honeywell is an upstanding company that is in an organizational change mode with the new CEO. Very demanding environment to work in, but not without its rewards."
good,Honeywell was a great company to work few years back but not most of the business are out sourced and management is all mixed up and i have seen lots of iteration
good,"Due to the nature of how the business unit I worked for was established ,through acquisitions, continuity in process and assimilation of product features and functions was difficult to obtain. Many, many talented and knowledgeable individuals all from divergent backgrounds made the establishment of a cohesive culture a challenge."
good,"Honeywell is more concerned with strategy and cost-cutting versus their employees. On a positive side, the projects and people are really nice and interesting."
good,"I felt that this company gave me a very strong sense of ""It's time to make the doughnuts, again"", if you know what I mean, if was very monotonous.  I always had a sense that we should all just keep our ""nose to the grind stone""."
good,Honeywell is going through some tough times which will required a very strong leadership team in order to hire and retain top talent resulting in growth.
good,A different place to curve your career and explore the things you desire with multiple technologies and varied support. Indeed a place to enrich yourself into the world of advancement
good,"Les méthodes de management venant des Etats Unis ne sont pas toujours adaptées à la France. La fonction de marketing est bien développée et bien maintenue - beaucoup de formations, supports, documents, procédures."
good,"I have started my career in thing company after graduation."
good,Honeywell can be a decent place to work and grow but don't expect any employee loyalty. Communication is bad and HR is terrible.
good,"- It was good work culture. "
good,"Prospected in territory developing relationships with accounts and DMs. Effective communication skills on products and services to improve clients needs, goals and objectives.Management needed to focus on professionalism and employee relationships. Started great then turned to needing improvements. Fair treatment to all sales reps on the teams from mid management level. overall corporate structure, support and culture as a brand in the industry."
good,"Good experience, exposure, and team members. Ability to problem solve and pro-actively manage through customer issues, vendor issues and internal issues is key."
good,Great place to work.  Focused on employees.  Working in energy efficiency and focusing on future needs of the planet.  Provide benefits and salary is ok.
good,Honeywell is all about the money and no about its people. They do whatever is needed in order to make the board happy. Not recommended
good,"Great team of people to work with, lots of opportunities to learn and grow your skills and experience with a host of in house learning materials and courses."
good,The staff is an engineering powerhouse with high work ethics and commitment to product integrity and quality.  Co-workers are exemplary.  Exciting work and intelligent workforce.
good,Aucune reconnaissance des compétences techniques par le haut management.Le haut management pense que le process remplace les compétences techniques spécifiques.
good,"The management have changed often, unable to focus on current issues and improvement ideas. Great benefits including health insurance."
good,Le poste de RQ n'est pas toujours reconnu au sein du groupe Honeywell. Le contact avec les collaborateurs en production est très enrichissant.
good,"I stay very busy with my daily workload. I start my daily wrapping skids for outbound truck shipments, then end my day insuring daily small parcels are shipped on time, via UPS,FedEx, and DHL."
good,Honeywell jobs are typical corporate jobs. When the company has a choice between taking care of employees or saving money. They will choose the money.
good,Small very competent work group with open communications. Flexible hours. Trusted by supervisor to execute assigned tasks without any micro-management.
good,"Productive and Engaging workplace, but corporate flow downs and culture has inhibited growth and has really hurt morale of the employees and their managers"
good,"Enjoyed the work. Excellent people, constant bad management decisions leading to massive wastes of money.  Government contract job. All decisions based on politics, no efficiency, not run like a business."
good,Supervision cares about numbers not employees. Forced overtime every Saturday and it would be Sunday if it was legal. Company just revised health care plan and it is very expensive for a family.
good,"It used to be such a great to work, but current financial issues has pushed the company to sacrifice their employees. Furloughs and lay offs are constant."
good,"Pros"
good,"Everyday in Honeywell there are lots of work and less time to perform. This takes a toll when we have to work continuously on weekends as well. "
good,"Good work life balance on project related roles due to flexibility by the management, however tedious at times due to periodic reporting cycles."
good,Worked using heavy equipment such as krane.  cut steele pipes and would run through the oven so they can cut. Worked with steele production and packaging.
good,large warehouse full of friendly and helpful coworkers. monthly activities daily meetings to keep everyone informed.
good,Workload was steady. service technicians were cooperative. Learnt a lot on gas detection systems. Management was ok. Lot of help between colleagues
good,"There are opportunities to:"
good,I learned to set and pot lenses and the importance of perfection as they are placed on airplanes. I enjoyed working here.
good,"Monetary compensation is great, Benefits package is not adequate, work life balance is a struggle but I have found managers are very accommodating and  flexible. People that work there are excellent to work with all go getters. Morale is low these days"
good,The AERO group is unnecessary as far as I am concerned. I worked with customers who had a better rating of my site than AERO did as far as quality escapes. Time and money is wasted by the sites trying to satisfy AERO metrics which don't match the customers.
good,"Liked order picking and packing. Got on well with others. Even though i traveled quit a way in car, i enjoyed the driving."
good,"I have been working at Honeywell full-time. I learned a lot from Honeywell, specially in the order management area."
good,"werken bij Honeywell betekend een zeer internationale werkomgeving, maar ook zeer gedreven door procedures en regeltjes. "
good,"helpful co-workers, lot of pressure, fine management, not so good work culture, awards and appreciations given for the hard work"
good,"In Transition, merged 3 companies and has a new SAP system in place.  "
good,This facility used to be a mom and pop shop that let people do what they wanted before Honeywell bought it.  The people that were here before then hate the new system and aren't very welcoming to new people that they see as the beginning of the end for them.
good,"Honeywell, is a good place. Stable and innovative products to work on.  Schedule is a driver over quality.  Flexible work hours."
good,i enjoyed my time with honeywell it was just not the place for me. if you like to married to your job and are willing to give them 60 hours a week its the place for you
good,"Honeywell ACS has very different approach for handling an IT projects. Most of them are internal for either their customers or vendors, but they difintely have world class pillar in all the area which leads the project in a very best innovative products."
good,"UOP is a strong technical and resourceful company to innovate and support multiple petroleum applications from midstream, downstream, to petrochemical applications,"
good,"Honeywell Aerospace Chihuahua es una empresa enfocada en el mecanizado de distintos componentes de motores para avion. Las jornadas laborales normales son de 9 horas y media de lunes a viernes con 15 min para desayuno y 30 min para comer."
good,"Working at Honeywell is like working at any other large corporation.  Work loads can be intense at times but do average out over time.  Toward the end of projects management decides to get involved and help complete the project on time.  "
good,Good work place with less salary and no work load. No growth in this company if you work more than 5 years. Using old technology.
good,"The environment is pleasant, and continuing education is encouraged.  The company has too many layers of management and is moving away from a lean philosophy to save in labor cost."
good,It is extreme organization with perfect management. that working for accounting beneficial fo me. i have learn day by day new things.
good,"Perform counting and inspecting of the product during the sewing process. "
good,"Honeywell has tough me how to work and manage personnel in the civilian sector, a lot of which I am use to from leading people in the military. Achieving my certification in Six Sigma has taught me how to eliminate waste by making a process better by incorporating all who are involved with the process. Working the off shift is helping to perfect my problem solving skills by asking critical/thought provoking questions amongst my leadership on shift. This mindset is allowing my team to be self sufficient and independent."
good,"Typical day consist for 6am tier meeting to discuss any Production Expectations and Issues, Health and Safety,and Housekeeping.  Reported to management on a 2 hour bases to report any issues or downtime. Great in working in and team environment."
good,The work atmosphere is pretty laid back. Upper management is clueless. The last couple of years things have take a turn for the worst. They have cut benefits and morale isnt the same as it used to be. There is no opportunities for advancement and the salary is not competitive. .
good,i am working in this company Satisfied and better Mangaement but i want change my present Location..
good,Not a bad place to work but the benefits are not great.  Honeywell has provided growth opportunities such as community involvement and tuition reimbursement.
good,Its good to work with Honeywell.I have learned UT/SI/HSI types of testing.
good,"- Typical day consist of testing new programs that are due to be used by the users."
good,"Management is good."
good,"gestion de plusieurs sociétés, au sein d'un csp"
good,"- Good Company and job security."
good,"Lots of processes, which is partly good and partly bad. Facility I work at is not terrible."
good,"A typical day at work is intense. You start your day running and do not let up until you shut off all communications and stop."
good,"I basically take a radio based product (UMTS, CDMA, 802.11abgn, Bluetooth, RFID) from radio dev stage, build up tools to troubleshoot the radios, troubleshoot the radios to ensure that the radios work according to radio manufacturer's specifications, build up test systems - streaming media servers, web servers to simulate a repeatable environment to characterize over the air performance,"
good,"Fast moving, High pressure"
good,"Had a wonderful time with working with Honeywell though I was on contract, I never feel like I was. Surely help me to learn a lot of things."
good,"Local managers and people were good and work environment was good. Unfortunately, upper management is fixated on off-shoring as much engineering work as possible, or hiring graduates to work for minimal wages. Not a good career company to work for."
good,The lack of test equipment made many repairs a guess.  How can one check an audio path with only a multi-meter?  Even the lack of AC and DC power supplies was an issue.  Troubleshooting was a joke. One would figure that a large company should have equipment for Technicians.
good,"I started at Honeywell in 2002 and have seen it change a good amount since then.  As time went on, working a Honeywell was not fun, there were demands for hours without any compensation.  This would have been ok if we were given the ability to agree/disagree with that when we first came in.  The people there are wonderful, very fun to work with.  The management I was under was lacking, but there were certain departments that had good management.  Basically, I loved what I did, but Honeywell took that love away.  Talking with other engineers, it was the same thing . . . what was once passion for their job just became a task that brought no joy and decreased morale."
good,"I really enjoyed my job as an engineer at Honeywell. Great co-workers, great pay and working on high tech equipment. I worked 40 hours a week in a cubicle. Then one day a manager slandered my performance and all hell broke lose. I filed a complaint in accordance with company policy where I was assured I wouldn't be retaliated against. Guess what happened? I was retaliated against and lost my job. DON'T EVER MAKE A COMPLAINT AGAINST A MANAGER AT HONEYWELL. Even with witnesses, their risk management people will attack you and make you look like the troublemaker. They know how to do this very effectively. When you're accused, just take it and keep your mouth shut.  I've lost my savings, my retirement, my health and soon my home. By the way, I had volunteered to help the same person who slandered me and whose comments destroyed my life. Thank you Honeywell for taking care of me. A employee with excellent performance reviews and 10 years with the company."
good,"Complex manufacturing environment.  Great people."
good,"Stressful environment, depleated m and e workforce. Face has got to fit, yes men need only apply"
good,"I worked a lot of overtime - when ever the need was there to get the products out.  Enjoyed working with my team members, was back up team leader, helped the engineers on projects to better preform our jobs."
good,"This is a call center that deals with energy conservation.  You must be well spoken, and good with troubleshooting.  The summer can be very demanding with some mandatory 13 hour days."
good,"Since the contract is based on a limited-term law, there was always the feeling of no job security. Home office was located in York, PA, certainly not centrally located. However, Senior Program Manager tried to do the best job possible under circumstances. Didn't really mind the amount of driving necessary."
good,growing plant with lots of opertunities to do lots of stuff and learn about a lot of different stuff. Great people to work with for the most part
good,"- writing flight code for a computer display unit for a military aircraft"
good,"good wages, bad benefits,  most equipment is modern and safe with current automation. management seems discouraged with corporate decisions. "
good,"Working at Honeywell has been a rewarding experience and has taught me alot.  A typical day at work would be answering the customer phone calls and troubleshooting any issues they may have with out product. The hardest part of the job would be the calls, doing tech support for access control can be very challenging depending on what the specific job site needs and getting that to work can be quite difficult, but, making that work for the customer has to be the best part. My co-workers are all great, we all work as a team quite well to make sure that every customer is  happy. "
good,"great environment serving the US military, maintained army equipment while they were deployed"
good,"N/A. As specified. Good benefits and job security, poor management."
good,"enjoy my co-worker's, like working with people from different countries. The most enjoyable part about my job, is making products for our Fire fighters, And knowing that you are making products to save a persons life."
good,"Honeywell is a big company with the expected bottom-line is king philosophy. However, there is a reasonable long-term vision and corporate diversification that smooths out some of the quarter-to-quarter thinking and hire/fire mentality."
good,Typical work day is from 0600 until 1430. This provides the opportunity to get things done in the afternoon before businesses close for the day. I have had great experience with management systems and Projects Management. Great group of personnel to work with but difficult at times dealing with a union environment.
good,Typical day: never the same
good,Co -workers are supportive.Projects are team based .Work environment is collaborative.
good,"There are a lot of smart and enjoyable people here, just like many other places - but like any large company, personal politics can matter. Even though there are supposedly systems in place to avoid that, it only means that it takes longer for the drama to play out. Positional power matters - if you can't figure out how to get along with someone with more power, you're going to be the one looking for a new job."
good,The core of the job is to train Soldiers on maintenance. The support from the corporate level is lacking in the logistics area.
good,"They (Management) tell ya about working toward Excellence, but your input isn't valued at All!!! No incentive to work hard or be productive!!"
good,"Started out as a box maker, moved to inventory detail then became the lead shipping and receiver. Management was great. Company moved the warehouse and production operations over seas."
good,Coordination with client and 3rd party vendors.
good,"I've learned alot of jobs while working here at Honeywell. It was a real good company when it was North Safety, but since then it's been alot of changes and they really don't benefit the employees."
good,Very fast environment and lots of orders to pick for shipping. Very dusty and dark. Needed more people to pick orders. More people to ship orders. Was all day shift.
good,"At this location, you have full-time employees and contract employees.  When you start as a contractor, their are no reviews to tell you if you are doing well or if you have a chance to of getting hired as a full-time employee.  Their are some full-time employees that file false complains against contractors, to get them in trouble. Some supervisors know about it and do nothing about it.   Horrible work environment for anyone."
good,The company lacks adequate documentation for employees to learn and accomplish tasks consistently.  Lots of opportunities to visit different customer sites to see varied configurations.
good,Learned many things but there is no recognition of work you do and no salary increments as well.Need to travel to factory all the time with n consideration. Too much partiality.
good,Started as an assembler and moved up really quickly. Management is respestful but Inefficient. The other workers are great I met several wonderful people here.  I enjoyed the opportunities they provide and the work isn't too difficult to learn or understand.
good,Good place to start as a fresher. People working there from more than 10-15 years controls the work. Not much opportunity for others to grow. Management needs to focus on reducing local politics.
good,"Too much bureaucracy, too much paperwork. Hard to get things done due to lack of materials and jumping through hoops. Management is only concerned with making themselves look good at the workers expense. Very high turnover rate and can't find a skilled trades person to accept a job."
good,"Very stable work culture, exceptional innovation, IP and R & D investment in new products development.   Committed use of ""best practice"" processes across all functions.  Exceptional place to work!"
good,"First two hours walk-down of entire facility looking for and repairing problems. New facility, so lots of little problems throughout facility. Some new technology incorporated in system and lots of bugs to get cleared up. "
good,"interesting projects highly respected company, a lot autonomy, and all specialists are very knowledgeable , however progress within the company is limited"
good,"Great place to work coming out of college and becoming a engineer for first time."
good,It was a very hectic experience and safety was a huge concern. Schedule is ever changing also. Management didn't know how to communicate with employees
good,"Extremely large company always looking for ways to save money.  Benefits are shrinking fast and reasons are always to keep up with market, regardless of profit levels.  25%  mandatory overtime for Machinists at my plant, so work life balance was poor for them and injury rate was high."
good,"Frequent changes in the management and sometimes the management is partial to few employees."
good,Fantastic work projects... horrible management and pay scale.
good,It wasnt the best job. The management was okay. I learned  little more welding skills. But i had no personal life working there. It was very hot and it was alot of standing in one spot all night.
good,Typical 8 to 5 PM day with some overtime. A lot of employee appreciation awards and recognition. When conferences come around it's a long and tiring day but well worth it. Customers appreciate how they are treated.
good,"b)	Working as HR Data Administrator for the US Data Team and EMEA Data Team"
good,Mi evaluación fue mucho trabajo y equipos pesados pero los compañeros enseñan bien
good,"Overall Honeywell is a very professional multinational company with a solid working environment, A strong process driven enviorment but needs to focus on their people culture a little more. Overall I good place to work though."
good,"My time with Honeywell was good.  "
good,If you come from cerritos college welding you will pass the certification test if you are contract you can be fired anytime so be sure on coming to this company.
good,Many opportunities for advancement for hard workers.  Great place to work overall.  Would recommend to those who are interested in working overtime in exchange for career opportunities.
good,"Has systems already in order so new innovations are limited but bright side your time isn't wasted trying to figure things out. Machines rarely go down. High productivity depends on contracts. Morale has room for improvements as benefits (paid holidays, flex account, and PTO) have decreased throughout recent years."
good,Team members on the floor work well together and respect each other. Company went through a management change and the new manager is mor concerned with production numbers and not honest with employees.
good,The days are filled with fast paced decision making. The company has great technology used across a wide variety of industries which makes it a complex environment.
good,"A great brand name company, but lacking people (Human related) skills. Would have been nice to not have to work so many hours and weekends. The coworkers were ok, just some of upper management didn't care much about the associates."
good,"I was fully reimbursed for college and was excited about my future, company politics seem to be restricting me from meeting my goal and continuing to work here."
good,"Almost everyone who works there on all 3 shifts is very unhappy most of the time. Too many work days, too many petty rules and too many lies and mistruths. A lot of people are always looking to leave and those who aren't are just there because they have been for many years and are too old to leave."
good,"High stress, profit oriented take no prisoner management style. Basically, I was told to hit my numbers or they'll find someone else to do my job. I loved the job, the people but it took it's toll."
good,"Better opportunities ,Better management.Pay for what you’re work so hard for.Bire great people that will get the job done day in and out.Don’t promote someone that’s not deserving of the position."
good,FHA loans have also increased the number in their mortgage payments and a few more dollars for their loans and other workers who have not received a loan in a bmw g5 or
good,"Every morning check last day’s real production output, review changes in client requirements and material availability. Adjust daily production plan accordingly and discuss changes with production engineers. Follow-up on delivery. Have meetings with supervisors and managers to communicate plans, mishaps, problems, etc. Maybe too inclined to micromanage. A lot of learning opportunities and good chances to move within the company to best fit the team"
good,"The culture is inclusive, people are supportive but workaholics. Longer you work better you are perceived. This is based off of 12 years ago, so not sure if things have changed now"
good,If you are married this may not be the job for you. I travel constantly and there is no plan to backfill our headcount shortages so that the coverage needs would be reduced.
good,"I worked at Honeywell during a time of stagnation and cost cutting beyond the usual drive for continuous improvement. I spent large swaths of my days reassuring my team that they would not be getting laid off any time in the near future. Honeywell is a massive company, and the continental scale moves can frequently feel like a square peg in a round hole at the local level."

good,"I joined hoping that Honeywell is a great company. However, there is politics and infighting. "
good,"Had the opportunity to get a significant amount of safety training as well as training in lean management, continuous improvement, 5S, and cGMP. I learned a great deal about managing people."
good,not a lot of room for advancement but good place to work management is good and treat you well with respect. quick work pace with a lot of time behind the weel
good,"Inconsistent management, worklife balance is great, m-f. The hardest part of the job is every month they are changing the goals and expectations. Sales job has got hard."
good,"It's considered normal to work 15 hour days at times. The atmosphere is incredibly dull and it's hit or miss if your colleagues will be friendly or self absorbed. Decent pay, but not a long term career move."
good,Good experience but low pay.    Job is challenging and current manager is excellent.  Whatever rate you go in at will not change much.  Promotion increments are very low.
good,"They pay was good, you topped out in 18 months. Plenty of overtime if you wanted to work it. You could even work in other departments if it was available."
good,"The Clearwater site makes advanced navigational products for the space industry.  However, the site is very good at overlooking continuous improvements that would improve process and product quality.  More and more of the managers are promoted to leadership positions who have less and less manufacturing experience and fail to take the lead on improving quality and cutting costs.  If the site/company does not change, it will follow the path that GE is on, selling off many of it's divisions that it no longer has the ability to manage."
good,"It was a hot and demanding employment with good relations among the workers, most everyone pulled their share. The equipment was pretty old and needed to be upgraded, but never happened while I was there."
good,Specific site was well developed with HOS and lean culture/tools. Was a very valuable learning experience. Corporate culture is lacking and respect for workers was poor when I was there. Comp was good. Benefits were not.
good,Employees are look at as numbers rather than employees. I enjoyed my day to day job requirements but the lack of care for employees drove me away. I did you enjoy my direct management though.
good,came in at three thirty in the afternoon done the laundry for the employers which took about 6 hours went home at 11:30 pm. how to do laundry run machines by procedure had a good boss It had its moments some days was harder than others talking to my friends and my breaks
good,Great place to work. There is many areas within the business that allow to learn and grow in your career. There are a few areas that need improvement but that's in all companies.
good,"The job is fast paced, which was good, but the work space was very limited for the amount of product going through for one person.  You may or may not get help.  They preached teamwork, but rarely did you see it."
good,"Kind of chaotic, all work is done by contractor and its not easy to transfer from contractor to full time as they are looking for cheap labor ."
good,Overall it was a decent place to work until the UF6 market price went down and they had to close the plant supposed to have a 3 to 5 year plan to start the plant back up if the UF6 market comes back up
good,Prefer to keep comments to myself.  Thank you!  Honeywell Aerospace (Grimes Corporation) is a good company to work for.  Very clean manufacturing area with the best cafeteria of any company that I have worked for in my career.
good,"Typický pracovní den, spočívá v uvaření kávě šéfovi, následuje  podívat se co nás v daný den čeká, nachystat si potřebné materiály, informovat o tom nadřízeného. Přečíst emaily, roztřídit dle důležitosti a připravit potřebné podklady. Zvedání a vyřizování telefonátů. A v průběhu dne vyřizovat různé požadavky zaměstnanců, řešit případné problémy a požadavky. Organizace chodu kanceláře."
good,"Good to work for 1-2 years max."
good,Too many times Ive been expected to work on the weekends and get nothing in return. the new ceo is too disconnected from the company and its workers. he asks for one thing and then a week later is mad you did what was asked.
good,"Pay is average to slightly above average, benefits are below average.  Extremely fast paced and disjointed in execution.  Attribute this to the competitive culture and market.  A lot of good talent that are often not utilized in alignment with skill sets."
good,That division of Honeywell is now defunct and was a highly functional group in its day but was so proto-typical of a midwestern environment of its time.
good,Days were pretty structured and goals were achievable.  I learned a lot about CNC maintenance and Facilities management.  Has it's own cafeteria with decent food.
good,"Great pay, awful work schedule. Rotating shifts and working holidays for shift coverage. Toxic environment to work in dealing with such chemicals as phenol."
good,My position was extremely fast paced. I learned the pressure of generating revenue. Worked with sales and order management as well as providing work for the plant.
good,"Good stuff - The vision for what a industrial software company should look like in 5 years from now"
good,Good pay not big on training.It is sink or swim with limited resources the turn over for managers/ supervisors is unreal often people have several managers within the year.
good,The company was a very nice place to work when I started there and my advance over the years was steady. I started as a receiving inspector and finished as a quality engineer. The company was private at first but changed owners at the end. There were a lot of unhappy people who were laid off over the past few years. Some of the people were there 30 or more years.
good,"Again, working with Talented individuals and gaining lifelong friendships.  Although TA was eventually outsourced, we were given plenty of time by management to identify new roles in advance which was truly appreciated."
good,They will always have a job for you to go to after you finish the project your on. But they don't allow raises and underpay there employees. They are just a company that's too big to care for the little guys in the conpany
good,"The best part of my experience at Honeywell has been to develop long term relationships with Sales People and customers all around the world.  To find new customers, markets and applications."
good,Typical 40hour work week corporate america type Electronics Metrology Specialist job. One excellent feature was the dollar to dollar fund match in stocks.
good,"The work was very interesting  in aerospace.  The company was family oriented, until they sold to Allied Signal. Then the company be came streamlined and totally a cut throat company."
good,Honeywell is a great starter company to move on to better more employee friendly opportunities. Would recommend to newcomers in the industrial field. Competitive pay and decent benefits.
good,"Decent place to work, environment is friendly for the most part and you'll have help if needed in your area. Salary and benefits are sub par but they aren't terrible. Good plant to get your foot in the door."
good,"Obviously a tremendously successful Fortune 50 company.  Built on strategic mergers and acquisitions."
good,Did not fit the business model of the organization my team was placed under which was across the country.  We were not given recognition for our accomplishment.
good,As a manager I had to work 12+ hours every day just to be able to manage the work. They should at least a couple of managers running the 7 different programs. There is no way you wont get lost among all that was going on. Even so I did very good and was ranked in a block 2 always.
good,"New management has made numerous changes, some are good and some aren't. The pay and benefits are good. You can expect to be on 2nd shift for an extended amount of time."
good,"Unrealistic expectations from managers."
good,Company works on many dynamic projects allowing individuals to learn multiple platforms. The end products that we are part of helps motivate. The company is going through some troubling times until things begin to settle I would not recommend anyone to come on board at this time.
good,"I have only been in this feild a little over a year. 12 hour shifts as helper.Bad job planning, extreme heat, carcinogens enjoy working with coworker."
good,"La situacion actual para muchos empleados es inestable."
good,"It was ok, always too much work expected in that 60 hour weeks not uncommon, so watch what you sign up for salary wise, it won't be that great when you figure it out hourly. Always good benefit packages, but constantly changing methodology. Implementing  standards became corporate vision, which isn't a bad thing, but when you buy another company every other day, there is no standard, business is so diversified, unity is something they will never have."
good,"A decent place to work relaxed setting interesting people to work with. Honeywell has competitive benefits. Company paid holidays, 401K plan, and health savings plan."
good,"Honeywell is an incredibly diversified company with all its pluses and minuses. In recent years shareholder value rose to top priority, while employees seemed to become a liability."
good,"The engineering management is poor, with no direction. The culture of the company makes reaching goals on time nearly impossible. The Honeywell name has a good reputation, however this plant is stuck in the 1950's."
good,"Honeywell is a great company to work with , it gives you ample scope for development and growth. "
good,Great job to learn and began to expand your skills. Not managed properly and there is not  a lot of room for growth for individuals who strive for it.
good,A typical day at work was inserting data into servers. The hardest part of this job was showing others the fundamentals when the time came to enter data correctly.
good,Honeywell was a no nonsense company with many new and innovative ideas in terms of manufacturing.  They streamlined workflow and brought their own culture to a small company.
good,Management doesn't care about the development of their employees. They contract the employee and send it to a site for a few months to support them but the training is basically OJT. The things learned on that assignment are useless for future assignments.
good,"Intense in the pursuit of its goals (read sales figures), Hence not for everyone, but without a doubt the best learning school for Distribution sales."
good,Enjoyed thoroughly working here. This is my first job in india after my masters degree in Real time embedded systems. Work culture is good but managers are least bothered about employee satisfaction
good,"Retention hasn't been great due to benefit changes over the past several years. (I.e. not currently offering a pension for new employees). Due to the retention and benefit issue manpower is always lacking. That is to say as soon as an opening is filled a technician leaves. This in turn increases the workload with fewer people to handle the breakins and additional capital support. However, the PRO about having fewer is that OT is abundant. Especially now due to PMT expansion. "
good,"Good place to work, challenging assignments."
good,Stressful and uncomfortable a lot of pressure. It seemed like everyone would blame a different group for things that were wrong rather than working it
good,I loved working at the St. Charles facility for 18 years.  The interacting the co-workers was the most enjoyable part of the job.  Typical 8 hour workday with flexible hours.
good,"The company benefits are the bare minimum for any similar company.  They do not have a 401K match benefit and have held pay raises for last two years."
good,If you build a better mouse trap expect criticism. If an operation consumes 80 minutes and can be performed in 10 minutes expect criticism from management and workers. I left because to invest energy into a system that prefers failure is not where I want to invest my time. Several Process engineers preferred not to change.
good,"Honeywell is a giant machine that doesnt operate in a flexible way, bureaucracy and processes makes everyone life very complicated. People in our department are very nice."
good,"stable works."
good,"I like the hours i worked (6am - 2:30pm, Mon- Fri) i learned about the Aerospace industry as it was my first job in that particular industry, management was almost non-existent, mainly worked with team leads. the hardest part of the job was its location(far from where i lived)"
good,"Good company for a guy looking to work in Pune, India. Not much scope of work in power electronics. All project are embedded & microcontroller based. Overall an average company"
good,"Ambiente socievole, lavoro stimolante, colleghi simpatici, possibilità di apprendimento di tecniche di programmazione, confronto costruttivo con colleghi"
good,"I worked at Honeywell in a contract capacity, while supporting the Payroll team through a People Soft upgrade. The team was close knit and fun to work with. I enjoyed this position."
good,"Financial issue with Honeywell not meeting forecasts have lead to furloughs and possible salary reductions.  "
good,"Work is challenging and the sense of accomplishment is great, especially for individual contributors. Unfortunately, HI culture has changed to drive employees by intimidation instead of true leadership.  Good people have been forced out of the company and more are looking to leave. "
good,"Honeywell is a giant company and in my division the leadership decision seemed like dogs at squirrel farm- turning and yanking in the direction of the nearest squirrel.  At one point I had 4 different managers in the span of 2 years.  Though the hardest part of my job was the sense and feeling that my opinion and thoughts mattered very little. Additionally, the benefits continue to erode away but my salary was very competitive."
good,"great co workers, really made me feel like part of the team.  Very knowledgeable and eager to help and new grad/hire like myself.  Inconsistency from top down management.  Furlough and layoff cycles made for very stressful situation visa v job security."
good,"Good for software groups and have strong policy for organisation, have good culture and safe for diversity employees also have growing mind set for the leaders"
good,"Honeywell is always finding ways to save money, they have no problem cutting salaries and sending employees on furloughs every chance they get."
good,"Aerospace is very interesting to work on."
good,Honeywell is a good place to work at but Senior Management continually changes which creates confusion and frustration with employees & customers
good,Honeywell | Aerospace just purchased Com Dev so I am optimistic that they will bring opportunity and integrity to the site.
good,"Good Senior Project Management teams.  The company strives to better their processes. If you're willing to try, you are given opportunities to learn a lot and contribute."
good,Overall a good company to work provided you are associated with the right department. Management is very focused and knows the business very well.
good,"A typical day at work:  Your work load at Honeywell offers variety.  Depending on the day, you may have last minutes shipments that would require working late, past you regular hours to get the shipment out the door to meet deadline and customer objectives. I have learned a great deal about Lean Manufacturing Processes to reduce cost and increase production, reduce errors in shipments and increase efficiencies.  Because of the nature of the business, management is well organized to support business goals and objectives.Co-workers are supportive and team players.  The most enjoyable part of the job is having in an environment that offers an interchangeable work load, from one day to the next."
good,"flexible time, employers tolerate, good environment, place to gain experience for fresh graduate, life balance good, working from monday to friday"
good,"travailler dans un environnement de travail négatif ou les employés son prêt a t`abaisser pour que eu soi apprécier."
good,"good pay for a good job.  professional staff at the site, very knowledgeable. more more more more more more more more more more more more."
good,"high customer focus, lean manufacturing to accomplish this goal, cross training efforts are more geared toward management requirements not shop employee ability, high focus on temporary employees not retaining current employee knowledge, tribal knowledge should be acknowledged more for more focus on quality products"
good,"You either belonged or you did not. Good company in terms of products and quality but personnel management was not the best in my view. A good deal of ""nepotism."""
good,"So when I first started at Honeywell, the company was transitioning into a level of maturity so there was alot of open communication, things were moving in a positive direction.  until a year ago, management seemed to have a good action plan and be moving the company where it needed to be. However now it seems that this company has developed what was called in the military (the Good'ol boy network) which means unless your in with the right crowd, you don't have a say in how your team or you as an individual get to do your job.  As a whole the technicians are great, everybody works well together and are very open to teach or learn. But again if you are looking for a foot in the door company. it's a pretty decent plance to work. management just needs some work ."
good,"Wrapping the project up. Design work is completed. Currently dealing with product readiness for production. Vendor and part capability studies. Interfacing with QC, Manufacturing and Procurement."
good,Tons of Overtime. Management is always looking for new ways and processes. always hiring new supervisors from outside makes things difficult.  Rotational management and supervisors every 2-3 years is rough on employees
good,Mauvaise gestion au sein de l'entreprise et une trés mauvaise ambiance de travail.
good,"Honeywell is a good organization to work for. They provide good salary and hikes. Good environment to work for. Good culture, diversification in terms of role. But pace of growth is not good and work life balance is also get effected here."
good,"People there can be nice and easy to work with.  Honeywell management is not the greatest and does not provide competitive benefits.  People hiring into UOP with experience may enjoy a salary bump, but may receive less vacation.  Work life balance is pretty good."
good,This is a company that have good product and have invested well in technology. As a contractor it has been difficult to contribute effectively due to lack of access to Networks and Operating Systems. If it is possible to do your job it probably won't to the way they like it and so end up using unapproved methods to achieve tasks. The out-sourcing of Computer services makes any task stressful and unrewarding as you search search for persons to give you third party information. Sorry to be so negative about such a good company. Tier meetings can be fun and reasonably good atmosphere and colleagues.
good,"* In-charge of the Operation & Maintenance-BMS "
good,"It has been several years since I have worked for Honeywell so I'm not sure if this review is accurate for today."
good,"There are weekly and monthly reports that are due respectively. I work with a diverse team that includes management, program manager, engineers, quality, etc."
good,As a typical day started at 6;30 am ended at 3;00pm. Depending on you what you wanted to learn was on you shoulders meaning you got out what you put in to it. I always felt communications between maintenance and management could of used improvement. My co-workers always was pretty good.  The hardest part of the job was sitting back and watching my job disappear. The most enjoyable part of it was the satisfaction fixing and repairing a piece of machine.
good,The Work site was Good . There was a lot of things I learned from this site. It was a shift base job.Only problem was the salary.Hence it was an off-role job they will not offer any attractive package
good,"Honeywell Building Automation is a fair company to work for.  The work is consistent but the Overtime and Hand-outs are minimal or non-existent and performance reviews do not exist. Our Thanksgiving bonus was nothing, our Christmas bonus consist of a BBQ lunch, even though the team consistently exceeds expectation goals year after year.  Training is also lack-luster (1 week this year), and for those who are new to the Building Automation industry, this company will have you quitting in 6 months due to the lack of direction and communication. Internally, the culture is financial over quality, quick over right, and members hold their skills and training dear and will not share anything, even when asked. Leadership seems to be fully committed to meeting Honeywell's expectations but out of touch with workers and their expectations. "
good,"Easy going work place with not much growth especially in IT. HR is quite poor"
good,"Manage all non legal specific duties, including integration of technology of knowledge management systems, provided training on SharePoint technology, maintained legal department website(s), project management special projects, and manage the CLE training for the lawyers."
good,It is a decent place to work. If you are not performing you will most likely lose your job though.
good,"Great place to learn and work."
good,"Job satisfaction is not there in Honeywell company. But learned alot about electronics in there, Management was not that good, co-workers are very friendly, i love what i do so there is no point of hardest part in the job, most enjoyable part is night shifts."
good,Lots of fast paced work. Learned software processes and design skills
good,"The Accounting group is very cut-throat. People will throw you under the bus any chance they get to better themselves. My direct boss isn't professional. He lets others on the team dictate how the team is ran and he does not take responsibility for his actions. The hardest part of the job is month-end duties because of the hard deadlines. Since I am relatively new, no one is willing to help me. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work from home 2 days a week and having a 9/80 schedule."
good,"Responsible for the assembly, disassembly, modification, and rework of electronic equipment used on Boeing 717/737/747/777/787, MD10/MD90, KC10, AirBus 319/320/321/330/340, Learjet, Bombadier, Bell, & Sikorsky aircraft; performs a variety of tasks including disassembly, assembly, cleaning, conformal coating, soldering, modifying, wire wrapping, reworking, & inspection of aviation electronics; ATEC testing of AIMS II product; work 8-12hrs a day, 6 days a week utilizing a microscope; following defined procedures and processes using various equipment in order to complete tasks; utilization of visual management systems including visuals to manage cells and to escalate issues; utilization of kanban systems; utilization of Built in Quality (BIQ), Thought Process Maps (TPM), & HOS tools."
good,Got passed over for a full time position without even getting an interview
good,It's  government contracting. There are no hidden promises of longevity .
good,"A typical day at work was, Building and testing electronics, working closely with management and the engineering staff.  "
good,The shifts are rotating and can be demanding when you get drafted and have to work 16 hours.
good,"1.	Order processing on supplier and acknowledgement with delivery status"
good,"I enjoy my work life. Co-workers always helped each other."
good,"Analyze current sales order to production status"
good,"Checked customers email, answer them in timely manner. Follow up if I have to. Translate customers inquiries from French to English, then transfers them to the right Customer care agent."
good,"Being engaged and adding value"
good,"Honeywell was a challenging environment to implement the HOS. The workers were great to work with and were energized however once finances began to fail the threat of the facility moving to Mexico began to loom and results were difficult to achieve. "
good,"Honeywell has great culture and is a great to place to work. The only issue with Honeywell is you everyday wondering if you are the next work group to get outsourced. It is hard to feel secure at HW, but other than that the people are  great and the work environment could not be better."
good,"A typical day would be running tier meetings in the morning and performing periodic gemba walks throughout the day.  "
good,"I was looking after documentation of BMS (Building Management System) projects. At the beginning it was difficult for me to understand as documentation needed all the details of site work but slowly i learned everything"
good,"	Shown improvement in reduction in the pending calls on month on month basis."
good,I worked with the best of the best every day. If I had a question their was always someone that was an expert that could give me all the detail I needed to get my job done at the highest level. I enjoyed my workers and the work. A very good company......
good,A great place to work in research and development. The employees are fun and great to work with.
good,Wide possibilities in the system makes working on it a challenging task.
good,"After many buy-outs, purchases and other aquisitions Honeywell finds itself still trying to identify its true base core business. As a corporation with many fingers, it becomes hard to understand Honeywell is more than the thermostat you buy at Home Depot."
good,Contract Work
good,"Except the managers, its really a good place to work and good team to work with."
good,cant disclose info
good,"Honeywell was not investing in new products at the time, went to another company that was close to home and paid more."
good,"It is a nice facility that has design, manufacturing, and test capability. Engineering has access to modern solid modeling and analysis tool. There is a great deal of six sigma training. It has been a great experience working here."
good,In a short period of time more things to learn. I became more communicative .I can manage my team single handed.Co workers are more helpful. Hardest part compared to is travelling from site to site. Since there is lot to learn from honeywell it is enjoyable job.
good,"The work is decent, corporate is run on the cheap:"
good,"A typical day at work started at 7:15 and ended at 4:30. I learned how to store various materials, check for serial numbers, perform preventive checks on military equipment, and organize equipment. Management was average and gave us the tasks for the day. My co-workers were laid back but would work when it came to it. The hardest part of the job was when the day did not have much work to do. It was a decent job and I enjoyed learning the procedures of warehousing."
good,Check attendance. Check workload and see where I have to place employees. Check employees productivity from prev. day. Have stretches before employees start work. I enjoy working with the employees. Most of them had worked under me for 10 or more years. I only had 1 person in management over me and he was in his office most of the time. I learned how to solve a lot of problems through training.
good,It was nice working for Honeywell. I liked the pay and the hours where grate. I had an awesome boss. He was very understanding about personal issue. I wish all boss where like him.
good,They cut back a long time ago on the number of headcount and the ones left over are overworked and not compensated at market. Many of the jobs were sent to India.
good,"The overall culture of the organization, specifically the Aerospace division has to change in order for it to be a good company to work for. Management has old school thinking and is not interested in change."
good,"Es una empresa con oportunida de destacar y hacer bien el trabajo, es algo burucratica por ser una empresa grande y con muchas divisiones."
good,I just was laid off via a 5 minute phone call.   Absolutely no warning. I had been working 48 plus hours a week and was being trained to take over a position of someone retiring.  I was released as they needed to give up a body for budget purposes
good,Working at Honeywell is an all consuming experience. Not for the faint fo heart. This is a global firm and be prepared to take calls from home in the evenings and weekends.
good,"I enjoyed writing software for Microsoft OS embedded products and solving customer issues during my time at Honeywell.  However, management was very disorganized and did not value any employee in my purview.  Onboarding for new employees was very poor and disorganized as well.  No bonus given to anyone that amounted to more than a few hundred dollars.  Very little in the way of employee appreciation - no meals, parties, gifts, or extra curricular events that showed management appreciated the employee."
good,"Great people and a diverse product portfolio makes it an interesting place to work. However, constant senior leadership changes (and the accompanying strategy changes) and valuing shareholder value above all else can leave employees in very uncertain situations."
good,Enjoyed my employment at this company. Very freindly and interesting work.  Challenging on a daily basis and very detailed inspections. Good teamwork and communication.
good,Wanted to automate everything always on continuous improvement ideas where good on health and safety practices. tried to work to just in time principles but with such a varied market it wasnt always practical to do so
good,"Difficult to be noticed for exceeding expectations, but worthwhile if you can manage it. You must keep in mind not only technical objectives, but overall business objectives."
good,"During my time here, there were many changes in the management staff and the processes used to procure material.  Lots of confusion and unnecessary rushes for product to not be used for more than 9 months at time."
good,"La empresa es buena, limpia y segura."
good,"Vertical management style, Supported work environment needs- computers, equipment, team work rooms, "
good,"The is a great lack of communication between all departments at the Frankford plant location. Upper management does not engage with its employees directly, only through e-mails. Morale throughout the company is low."
good,"Good exposure in SAP Project Systems Module "
good,"Since the spin off its been kind of hectic and stressful. All the factory, DC and personnel moves have made it difficult for the customers and employees."
good,Good place for getting experience but after that not many chances to enhance your career.
good,"many career options"
good,"Overall I have a mixed experience."
good,"Good place to work Experienced Department Leader for Honeywell Commercial Security a leading global provider of access control, intruder detection, video surveillance and integrated security solutions for the commercial and residential markets"
good,My favorite thing about the job i have is the people i work with. I come in everyday to a team that cares about each other. Management on the other hand and overall job security is always in question with Honeywell.
good,"the people you work with make a big difference to the work you do and the vast majority of the people at Honetwell want to suceed, always willing to help and point you in the right direction"
good,"its a good platform to showcase your skills an get appreciated about your work."
good,Good Place to work. good culture. Flexible timing. Competitive nature. Good people. Challenging work. have to work hard to achieve goals Increments can be better
good,"Great workplace with competitive colleagues, lot of growth opportunities, fair work life balance, fair compensation and benefits, great leaders, great learning"
good,Fair days wages for fair days work . Need more leadership in management!!!! They are not very organized and often upset customers.This usually falls in Managements area . They love to have meetings often resulting in nothing being accomplished!!!!
good,Fast paced and non stop. You are constantly on the go . If I was younger it would be a little more fun. I always do my job to the best of my ability and wish the younger people would do the same.
good,It's a good old boy system and few woman are promoted.  They do offer decent benefits but they seem to be getting more expensive.  Not the best big company to work for.
good,Lots of opportunities globally.  Ability to move between business segments to support growth.  I spent 12 years in AERO and 5 years in Safety & Productivity solutions.
good,"Different departments have different cultures, therefore has had to depend which department your are in."
good,"Overall Honeywell was a good company.  The company closed down, otherwise I would probably still be there.  They closed two location. I liked working there."
good,"Conflicting HR policies with Managers flowdowns"
good,There is a good interaction between the various functions. It is a very team oriented environment with regular check ins for the progress being made in production and maintenance.
good,"Honeywell is a big behemouth in the metro Phoenix area.  It is good for something things, but is so-so in others.  There are times that the bureaucracy gets in your way.  Other times it is a good place to work.  All of this depends upon whom you are working for, and whom you are working with."
good,"As a contractor, it can seem that you will be able to get a full time position offered to you. That is not always the case however. Most offers don't show until very late in your contract. Can be stressful not knowing if you have a job."
good,Good to learn and get experience. There were interesting projects to work on. Supportive of continuing education. Travel to other locations made it interesting.
good,"Creating repair orders, quotes and return authorizations through the SAP"
good,"Great Company, Strong leadership at C Level and has found a new niche in the connected space and software as a service aligned, to Industry 4.0 trends"
good,"they took my pay down after being there 2 years, making $17.07 an hr, to $14 an hour, an force to go to another shift. so I quit, an found another job paying more."
good,Good company benefits if you are looking for a job with some benefits. Good environment to also work in and gain some work experience if you are starting out
good,Honewell purchased our company and we were doing really well until they forced us to integrate into their way of doing things.  Then the place was shut down and moved to Mexico.  Big mistake...
good,Everyone is focused on the task. Most meetings are online so it is very impersonal. There is an open seat culture where we don't get to keep any personal items.
good,It was a very strict and formal position. They were very much into safety which I appreciated. I do believe they didn't put much effort into promotion.
good,"The technologies and processes are exceptional with the exceptional work culture. Training is conducted continuously to keep employees up to date. The focus on innovation is great. Wonderful synergy between Marketing and development."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral y buenas prestaciones, en general un buen lugar para trabajar."
good,They don't allowance for fixed site. They don't give site near employees. Otherwise the working is good. Team members also good and always understand.
good,"If you are willing to relocate, opportunities are available to advance in the company.  Fortune 100 company that has a large presence around the world."
good,My boss was in charge of a region so we only had a site lead. Our boss would come in for a few days every quarter or every other quarter just to check on things and see how everyone is doing.
good,I worked at Honeywell for a contact position. My supervisor was great and the pay was appropriate for the position. The travel was far but I was committed to the position for the time. I didn't care much for the team that I worked with. they seemed to go above and beyond to make me feel excluded from the group.
good,full of unnecessary process and hurdles making role difficult and hard to implement change quickly. generally friendly but high churn of staff as senior level
good,"It was ok, management is ok, supervisors are Good, co workers pretty cool. The jobs are pretty easy but the pay is low till yove been there for about 5 years. Overall no to bad though."
good,If I didn't end up pregnant I would like to think I would still be there working. They have a strict attendance policy and pregnancy appointments don't exactly fit in that being a temp but I loved it some shady stuff but not as bad as other places I e experienced.
good,Responsible for picking orders or restocking empty aisle locations. There was usually plenty of work throughout the week. Mandatory overtime during peak season was always abundant.
good,"not a bad place to work."
good,Honeywell bought out a long standing company which valued the community and workers.  Honeywell did not share the same values.  All correspondence was done on line without much human contact.
good,At our site we had the ability to run things how we saw fit.  I loved working there. A lot of corporate decisions I did not agree with. Corporate does not seem to care about its employees. At the Minneapolis site they do care about their employees.
good,"El liderazgo del sitio es bueno, pero el exterior es muy frío y poco objetivo. Puede llegar a ser muy severo."
good,.Good place to work if you have the right people to work with. Health Care benefits offered is very expensive. A lot of work related challenges to keep you going and always on the move. Must learn to work independently as most of your co-workers work remotely.
good,Lots of manual labor. Environment is really hot. Doesn't pay enough for the hard labor. Doesn't give raises often. High turnover rate. Nobody stays here long
good,nice place to work pay is pretty good you learn a lot it is also very fast paced and takes time to learn the accurace and pace of the other senior employees
good,"developed and built interesting technology in defense of the country, but corporate culture allowed ladder climbers to benefit at expense of coworkers"
good,"I very much enjoyed the people I worked with and the work is meaningful. The high security aspect wears on you after a while as does working in ""a cave"" if you are in a production role or higher security role. There seems to be 4 managers for every associate. They are all great, it is just a little top-heavy sometimes. Engineering and technical roles don't see much advancement or raise in pay. Mid-level management pay is higher than that of the highest specialized engineer who does the actual work. They have a hard time keeping their best engineering talent. The union side of the workforce is paid very well and as a culture tries to do as little as necessary. They are all nice and are not bashful about sharing their philosophy. If you are high-energy and motivated, you will feel like the brakes are being applied as soon as you walk in the door until the end of the day. For some people this works, but it will drive you crazy if you have even a hint of ambition or purpose."
good,The Houston PDC is a decent place to work with average pay for the job. Has A/C in the warehouse with a fairly laid back atmosphere compared to some other warehouses though can be hectic at times
good,"Honeywell is too large.  There are too many divisions, too many layers of management, too much managing from the rear, and a palsy of leadership.  You would thing that a company this size would know their business, but spend some time here and you will learn otherwise."
good,"HPS software engineers are generally required to work under aggressive schedules that do not necessarily allow for enough time to follow the proscribed development processes. Expect that when deadlines approach, and schedules begin to slip, an overt attempt by management to assign blame to begin."
good,Good company but they really not want to have a new things to working Im so boring day over day and get pay go home and back to work after that with slowly salary raise
good,Site has a storied history of prosperity. It will be a mainstay at the current location for as long as they have the right personnel performing to the level of expectation.
good,I like working for the company it was an awesome job the only reason I left was because I had to relocate. I would recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a job
good,Great staff great co workers with a very competitive salary! Would definitely recommend this company to others the dental package along with the 401k make this one great place.
good,"Big company, nice working place, Aver day the same work, only sitting and assembly the same part or testing alll day, start at 6 am and finish at 2 pm,"
good,"Uber Technologies Inc. skidded into the public markets Friday, falling 7.6% below the ride-hailing giant’s already conservative offering price in a bleak debut for the nation’s most valuable startup."
good,"Work is challenging, but the opportunities for grown is great.  People are smart, friendly, and helpful. "
good,The hope for a long time career with Honeywell is not likely. Learn what you can while you are there. It can make you more talented and useful in your larger life career journey.
good,"As an entry into the work force, the company allowed me to develop as an individual and contribute to office.  Management recognized talent and compensated accordingly."
good,"Experienced Talent Acquisition Specialist with a demonstrated history of hiring for different domains like Sales, ITES, Marketing, Finance and Engineering. "
good,It was very good experience working with the company . The work culture is amazing. It helped me a lot for my professional growth and learning. Learned new applications.
good,"-No work life balance"
good,"A lot of confusion on scope and procedure."
good,"Good atmosphere to work. support projects are there."
good,Honeywell is a text book Fortune 100 large and global workplace experience.  They have high standards which push everyone to exceed and can also push the work life balance out of balance.  I respect the company's current mission to transform their legacy hardware products into connected product offerings.
good,Pésimo Director General en Honeywell Optoelectronica
good,"Honeywell provided me the great opportunity to work in China for three years, providing me and my family the opportunity to live in China and support us with expenses that allowed me the opportunity to learn the language and appreciate the culture."
good,Muy Buena empresa con mucho apoyo a los trabajadores.
good,The safety and security of employees and customer is Honeywell's top priority.  Safety first was embedded in the culture that Honeywell reinforced through training and compliance requirements.
good,"A typical day was pulling parts, bagging parts, tier meeting, and cycle counts if needed.  Manager could be difficult at times, but overall not too bad.  He did not give praise for outstanding job performance or for anything else. There is a good bit of unethical behavior among the supervisors as well as favoritism.  The best part was availability of overtime and usually free breakfast on Saturdays/Sundays. My pay was pretty good also."
good,It was a good job while I was still in school. They also picked up part of my tuition. The company had meat its goals for the division I worked in and had lay offs.
good,Honeywell provides a collaborative work environment. An intelligent group of people who are dedicated to success. Management needs to work on improving work life/balance
good,Company has a great vision but outsources wayyyyyy too much. Workload is manageable and when your a full employee theirs lot of opportunity to challenge yourself.
good,Metrologic Instruments was a mid sized company bought out by Honeywell. I can rate Metrologic Instruments but cannot rate Honeywell as I did not spend time there after the acquisition
good,Same thing day in and day out. Left because I chose to pursue my dream as a firefighter. If you have other plans for a career I would not recommend working here.
good,"I usually always had a good day at work, good co-workers. I learned a lot about myself as well as the company. The culture is diverse with people from all kinds of backgrounds. Honeywell is always trying to make sure you have everything you need for your work environment. And are supportive if you have any questions about your job duties."
good,"Straight forward factory job. I was only a temporary worker, but the work was standard and it was easy to follow instructions. The work environment was friendly and helpful"
good,"ok."
good,A typical day at work would be very stressful.. The learning process was average.. Coworkers was a  joy to work with..  Management very hard about time worked minute by minute.. Customer's contentedly looking over your shoulder..  Very stressful.
good,"I was satisfied with the internship, it was my first and only Mech Engineering internship, it is the kind of environment I would like to work at, I would be happy if the rest of my career followed Honeywell"
good,Like the people I worked with and the work I did. My experience with Honeywell is a good one. I didn't have an issue with any one I worked with or any one I worked for.
good,"I work reomote so my days normally start with a review if the numbers from the previous days bookings adn orders, then onto functional meetings.  Normally try to get out in the field and work with my team of 50 plus with 7 direct reports to visit customers so that I can coach, develop and support the growth asked for by the business.  "
good,"No communication exist on floor production between managers and engineers, quality is not priority."
good,Crescita nell'ambito della comunicazione ed eventi.
good,very competitive as soon as you walk in the door. no one will actively seek to help new employees out.forces attitude to the employees and open minded opinions are to be given rarely at the risk of your employment.
good,"A typical day at work was taking care of multiple customer emails that come in to a department email and resolving their issues. Followed up with two conference calls and taking incoming calls as well. The afternoon would entail a lot of the same.I worked for Honeywell for 22 years, which allowed me to learn all I know about account management.  For the most part, my management team was pretty hands off due to me knowing more about my product line that i supported then they did due to it being newer to them.  When they were involved, they were very supportive.  I  believe, unfortunately, the workplace culture has slowly went downhill.  When I first started with them I felt needed and wanted and the company was doing well.  However over the last 10 years or so it has slowly lost customers and has released many good employees while downsizing. The hardest part of my Job was watching the product line that I supported to slowly go away.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers that I supported and the people I worked with."
good,"Honeywell USA is a good company to work with. It has good senior management, VP who have excellent communication, presentation skills. They know how to blend with employees and try to bring the best. Company also has some very good co workers. Has good cafeteria, cafe, gym, good common area for employees to discuss"
good,"At Honeywell I always get the satisfaction from manager, supervise for quantity and quality also fast learning."
good,I worked for Honeywell for 8 years in a total of 2 countries and 2 different divisions. Very pleased to have had the experiences that I gained from HON.
good,Most of my time has been spent on individual work in my office. I was given freedom to organize my work although certain work needed to be completed within a broad time frame.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that opportunity to work with the most brilliant scientists and engineers in their field. The most difficult part was to juggle the work load as it increased despite the reduction in staff over the years. We were disappointed in management in their arbitrary decisions to reduce pay temporarily in bad times when never compensating us better in the good times.
good,My position was eliminated without notice. the company cares more about making money and share holders than families and workers. I moved to help company and they didn't give me notice of changes due to running small factory.
good,"Nice place to work. I t has its positive side which was the people. The negative was the management.Do more with way less."
good,"* Excelente cultura de trabajo"
good,"Overall a good place to develop your skills and plenty of opportunities to grow in your career"
good,Only did ohe freelance job for Honeywell 25 years ago so I can't really say much more about this job. It was an annual financial report with graphs and charts.
good,"Some of my best time I have had working. Great people, family oriented, wonderful place to start your career. They treat every one fairly but unfortunately advancement opportunities are very hard to get."
good,"Not the greatest, not the worst, awesome schedule. There isn't a lot to say about this place. You are given a task and you complete it. You know what is expected of you just get it done."
good,Honeywell is a good place to work. There can be challenges when it comes to engineering vs management however that is pretty common in the industry.Overall would reccomend
good,I goood learning experience. I never thought i would like a forklift operator position but I did and was something I look forward to doing again just wish I was there longer
good,"El ambiente laboral es tranquilo, el trabajo es sencillo, capacitación pagada y adecuada"
good,"Honeywell is a company, that deals with life safety devices. Honeywell specializes in fire panels, detectors, thermostats. Honeywell, also has a homes division."
good,"Working on meetings all day is kind of frustrate, specially late night or early mornings."
good,Nothing much to say. Bored and slowed at work. I was sick and tired of same things mentioned in the meeting of every morning. We didn't have chance to use phone.
good,"Honeywell has continued to maintain a good culture, even as they've cobbled together tons of acquisitions over the years, and driven EPS to new heights."
good,new ceo has increased pressure on everyone which makes it a work life imbalanced company to work with. office politics is too much and hence very little chances for work oriented people to grow
good,Buena escuela para todo el tema de sistemas de seguridad electronica.
good,Cool technology/nice work environment/good co-workers/management treated employees well. Honeywell is a large legacy company with many of the stagnant systems that come with huge companies
good,"Good Company to work with. Very slow professional growth as an individual. Due to some of the persons in company, cant blame whole organisation. Company is good."
good,Honeywell was a place of employment that I would only recommend to those with drive and that are well versed in there positions. They aloud me to perform my duties without any issues.
good,"gutted insurance with no salary offset. little opportunity for growth or advancement. pigeon hoes people, will have to leave to get decent salary increase"
good,"Worked at a small facility within the Honeywell empire.  Every month end, quarter end, and year end was absolute chaos (as if it came at a different time every time) in an attempt to meet sales expectations.  Never really set up for success, impression was corporate never really invested the site."
good,"Starts with meeting with every level "
good,Work with professionals. Company cars are provided although  you as an individual contributor have to pay for that vehicle out of your own pocket.  Insurance is included.
good,"Honeywell has a well working environment, at Honeywell I expanded my knowledge on high level testing and low level testing. I also worked on model based requirements."
good,"Typical day starts with a few stand-up meetings followed by Quality tasks such as issuing QNs, creating or repairing QIRs, initiating or follow-up on CARs, loading part numbers in Net Inspect to support FAIRs, etc. From a Quality standpoint, Honeywell talks the talk, but doesn't always walk the walk when revenue is at stake. Is very focused on Stockholder returns instead of employee benefits, such as compensation or education or flexible hours. There is often more emphasis on petty interpersonal issues than job performance. Does not promote from within or give all employees a fair shot at opportunities - relationships often trump subject matter expertise."
good,going to work and getting my job done in a fair amount of time. A lot of microscope work with small parts. Always willing to learn new stuff and a team player.
good,My review about Honeywell is that it is a good company to work for. There’s a lot of changes that happen with no expectations. Hardly any opportunity to grow.
good,"Was tough to do my job, you couldn't work up to your potential, your peers took offence to you working above and beyond. Other than that it would have been a great place to work."
good,"It is a good place to work, but they have no loyalty to the employees. Worked there for 34 years and was laid off when I trained an outsource person to do my job."
good,Good Place to work with. multinational company witth right working culture. i have learned troubleshooting experince in honeywell. workplace culture good.
good,"not stimulating enough. bad benefits. no mentoring, no work remote policy. a legacy company still stuck in their past ways of doing things. A great engineering company but haven't embraced technology yet."
good,"good working ethics, good people management, safe, perfect place to learn new skills, close to home, clean facility, friendly environment,"
good,"Need better management, lots of overtime, not far to temps. easy work, great pay if you can do all the overtime worked every weekend. lots of paper work"
good,We started work at 6:30Am and worked until 18:00 Pm. The pace was not to fast and the environment was friendly and relaxed. The hardest part of the job was getting to meals on time in a combat zone
good,"Worked onan assembly line"
good,"Definitely enjoyed the people that I worked with, but due to downturn in economy financial benefits were non-existent. I worked in a new and innovative dept but the workload kept increasing without adding the necessary resources to match."
good,this site has different groups you are in or your not. mainly listen and follow simple directions and read the write ups. watch your hour to work ratio.
good,"Biased management, have to know the ""right people"" kind of organization at Franklin plant, the coworkers were made up of half of the team being level headed individuals and the other half being people you want to steer clear from to avoid any trouble even if you didn't do anything trouble related"
good,"i worked at Honeywell UOP division in Des Plaines, Illinois.  I worked there for one year at their facility in Des Plaines, Illinois.  UOP stands for Universal Oil Products."
good,Honeywell was my start and I enjoyed management and moving up in a better position. Like the program I worked on and enjoyed the people. Good place to work and have a career
good,"Great environment for recent graduates students, the company provide trainings.  work and life balance. Some fictional areas promotes the career developments and promotions some not. "
good,"i learned too many thinks in injection mold  "
good,Not sure where Honeywell is going...lots of edicts by upper leadership that do not make much sense to the worker-bees.  Seems to be a lot of people just following orders without questioning logic.
good,"Fui estagiária e nao tinha atividades delegadas, precisava ficar procurando atividades."
good,It all depends on what COE you are working for. Honeywell has a new CEO and drastic changes are talking place. Morale is low and no one is thinking on improving existing processes.
good,"loved the job paid for my education.Work for Honeywell for 8 years."
good,Honeywell requires 100% compliance with all applicable EHS regulations & laws so you stay busy every day working to meet or exceed these requirements.
good,"Having come back to Honeywell 3 years ago after a 10-year employment (1997-2007) with Honeywell, I had noticed the engineering expertise had fade deal to the fact that too much focus being placed in outsourcing. I came back to Honeywell to take a Project Engineer job, and found there was not enough technical challenge."
good,"The coworkers are great, the best I have ever worked with. The corporate management is terrible. The company is continually taking benefits from the employees and asking them to work harder with less. promotions and pay raises are rare.  When employees leave, many are not replaced, the work is spread amongst whomever is left. "
good,"Tough work, High expectations with minimal resources."
good,"Very structured group"
good,Enjoyed working there due to the friendly astomphere. No body really stressed one another out. Relaxed environment. Everybody knew one another and would help each other out if needed.
good,"Most of the people are great to work with, but there is NO work/life balance. There is a need for a lot more people to be hired but are not hiring enough to fill the roles."
good,"Honeywell purchased the company I was working for and told employees there would be no changes in staff. Layoffs started within 30 days of purchase, keeping only necessary employees until location closed"
good,I went in expecting to get hired on after a year. Found out that some of the guys spent years as a contractor. Didn't want to be one of those guys. Found another opportunity. Decent company though.
good,"... with many projects going on simultaneously, not only in CT, but all over the world. I was responsible not only for training in North America, but I was also covering anywhere from San Diego to India."
good,"I enjoyed the company making me step out of my comfort zone to learn new things and new ways to do the job."
good,Fast paced work environment... good overtime... terrible benefits... there is not many options or room for growth within the limits of employees... the pay brackets are also a little strange
good,It was slow but good experience. People are relaxed and work at their own pace. Not strong enough upper Management.  Work was interesting. Too many employees.
good,Many times in my position was your quality checked. A flawless rating was required when most instances it could not be done. Space level work is very intense with little room for error. Your job can be threatened even when asked to do impossible work. Even the supervisors threatening your job won't do the work because it is so difficult.
good,"Hard to determine what you'll do day to day as the underlying process changes nearly constantly.  To be fair, my department is ""new"" and still not clearly defined.  However, ""new"" is characterized as less than two years."
good,The aerospace industry provides exciting work using high-tech tools. The job provides tasks that require thoughtful efforts and that you take responsibility for your decisions.

good,"inconsistent hours offered , and last minute requests make the"
good,"A professional organisation with well defined procedures, however this can be frustrating at times as there is plenty of red tape."
good,I have been employed at my current job for seven years.  I was thrown under the carpet by my own Sales Manager to obtain a project from my customer.  The sales management team created new accounts (mostly bankrupt companies) to achieve a unsustainable quota.  What was once a great job turned sour overnight.  The company offered no explanation for this cause of action.
good,I did well in my years at Honeywell but things changed. The effort to to reduce or eliminate the US head count changed the employee environment in a very negative way.
good,I enjoyed my time there. Not a good place to work if looking for work-life balance. There are a lot of expectations with little respect to your personal life. Benefits are good.
good,"Challenging work life with an exposure to get lot of industrial knowledge."
good,I am no longer with the company but I am thankful I got the opportunity to grow and develop my career as an engineer. I was employed there for over 17 years.

good,"Typical day included coordination with multiple military commands and assigned inspection teams, in preparation for computer network security inspections."

good,"Naučial jsem se práci s big daty - Cassandra, Azure, JIRA"

good,Great job enjoyed working in the environments they put me in. The job puts your mind at focus and keeps you thinking constantly about what your doing.
good,"The Honeywell Process Solutions unit was a tough place to work.   With numerous ERPs and management that seemed to be against change, it wasn't the most ideal place to begin your career.   It seemed like I was being pulled in multiple (contradicting) directions at once."
good,"Honeywell invents and manufactures technologies that address some of the world’s most critical challenges around energy, safety, security, productivity and global urbanization. ... HBT includes Honeywell’s Environmental & Energy Solutions (E&ES), Security and Fire,"
good,Must be a self starter and willing to participate in a ONE HONEYWELL atmosphere where you do whatever is needed mostly due to satellite office consolidation and business mergers and acquisitions
good,"Was treated okay during my tenure, the organization has decent work life balance. The people are friendly, pay is decent. It not the worst job in the world."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is recognizing employees for continuous improvement ideas.  The hardest part is motivating other functional managers to embrace quality and drive continuous improvement with their direct reports.
good,Very stressful required to perform with limited resources.  ISC management challenging to meet customer requirements with minimal workforce and resources.
good,Its good place to work and has good employee friendly environment to support with. Also i see proper segregation of duties among the employees and they know what needs to be done.
good,"Depends on what department you are in and if you are under a contract whether you will enjoy yourself at Honeywell. Honeywell as a whole is a great place to be, and everyone is nice."
good,Honeywell is a very good company to learn. I learnt a lot during my tenure at Honeywell on project management. Here you get the opportunity to directly interact with customer and learn about their needs. Its a place where you get enriched with knowledge by working on the job.
good,Honeywell is a great company to work for. Worked at Honeywell 37 years. Honeywell has proved a great place to work and provide me a great life style. I encourage anyone to work at Honeywell.
good,"I was working there as a contractor, so got no benefits.  As such, my experience is not typical of what regular employees would have.    I liked the work (satellites are pretty neat) and people and thought I was paid fairly."
good,"Workplace culture can be stressful. Layoffs, furloughs, and pay cuts have become commonplace. Merit increases average as low as 1.5% for many employees on a team."
good,"My employment at Honeywell occurred during a lockout."
good,"Honeywell's corporate strategy is to buy up competitors, take their technology, and customers, then layoff the staff. The jobs are then moved to China. This is a slow process, but it eventually touches everyone. "
good,working with clients and engineers to ensure that the oil refineries worked properly was very interesting. I dealt with a different companies around Latin America so it was interesting to speak with different types of personalities. It was a great job to see how different industries operated.
good,It Is a good place to work there you need to work fast so the time go fast. The team production train very well so you learn vey fast you work with dangerous chemicals so you need to b alert
good,Low Paying with Good Work-Life Balance. UOP has excellent and very experienced team of people all around. Very good learning environment and policies for new grads.

good,stopped being honeywell in the 90's due to mergers and buy out's so no review of current co can be made.  even my product line no longer exists .......
good,"working at Honeywell you must always have your listening ears on and thinking caps on. customers call in to request product information , product availability, statues on their orders and information on replacement products to products no longer available."
good,"I worked 5 years at the company and I am indifferent. They finally gave people raises that deserved them but still only work the bar minimum to get by so they don't get in trouble, I was skipped over multiple times for jobs I was qualified for. I'm not bitter just moving on to a company that values all employees instead of a select few."
good,"Honeywell is a good company to work for.  It has its positives and its challenges like most other companies.  Overall, it is a good environment to learn and operate in."

good,Company representatives were slow to reply online or by phone for issues related to the staffing service and did not promote contractors for permanent opportunities with company.

good,"The difficult part about working here is there is constant change, the systems are discontinued and it's difficult to receive help.  It's very difficult to do your job when it takes months to get access to certain tools and systems.  Also, management is always changing- which makes it difficult to keep up with business acumen.  You can learning a lot working for Honeywell but it is self taught.  You have many opportunities to produce more learning more."
good,Small ideas. Mainly SBIR efforts. Always scratching to make payroll. Personnel come and go weekly. No continuity. A lot of nepotism. Harsh HR Dept. Did not enjoy working there.

good,"Contrôle qualité des compteurs d'énergie électrique"

good,"Provides great opportunity to learn.Lot of work load, very less flexibility, no work from home option, shift timings are bit painful, good for freshers"
good,Had a hard time managing their identity during the various acquisitions that occurred while I was working there.  They were more concerned with preserving management than they were taking care of the rank and file.
good,Good bunch of people to work with and great experience in working inside a larger a large Multinational. Good pay and hours of work
good,A typical day will vary depending on your position/organization.  Most days start with understanding your assigned work and deliverables for that day.

good,Assembled a good team of buyers.   Training scheduled to insure MOP could be followed and understood.  Flexible hours available with management approval.
good,A lot of work! Is a place to get all the experience for the position you work. Management aware of issues and willing to solve them in the long term. Although is not an employee company.

good,I spent 18 years with Honeywell and was very happy with the knowledge given to me and the talent i gave back.  Management was the issue.  Their name was more important to themselves then the growth and employers in the company.

good,Good environment to work and very good people to learn from. Management very professional and willing to train and listen and empower to get the job done. It's a nice place to work if you want to begin your career in the aerospace community.
good,The work is interesting and usually fairly rewarding. The pay is pretty average but you're expected to put in more hours/more work and assume more responsibility than comparable positions at similar companies. The company is definitely driven from the top down with concerns for stock price and responsibility to shareholders and executive bonuses at the forefront.
good,"Great atmosphere to gain experience and branch knowledge to different disciplines.  Difficult to advance in place, need to jump from position to position to advance.  Managers are not truly allowed to manage and poor accounting software and matrices drive all and mire all business decisions.  If it's not green on a spreadsheet, it's frowned upon and affects reviews."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of multiple phone calls, and emails.  I responded to, and handled requests from the project managers, as well as account rep's.  I had good professional relationships with all of my co-workers.  I learned a lot about contracts, both standard contracts as well as Government contracts.

good,"Instrumentation & Controls"
good,I choose not to publicly review this company.  My personal opinions are not a public matter and I have nothing further to add.
good,I got my lean expert certification at Honeywell. Honeywell has great Technology. I worked on systematic problem resolution project which addressed customer issues that are common at Honeywell sites.
good,Medium to high level of pressure to meet objectives; which were set by management directives.  I did not feel that there was effective upwards communication or engagement of the human resource. To be fair the business was disrupted from the introduction of a totally new Business System.
good,"Conservative organization with Average with pay."

good,Not easy to get hired or even placed as a contractor unless you know someone or have a relative working there.  The people are great to work with and most direct hire employees are very knowledgible and helpful.  Seemed to be in a constant state of workforce reduction.
good,"A great place to learn technology as Honeywell UOP employs technical experts in Refining, Petrochemical and Gas Processing Industry"
good,Enjoy working on the parts I work on but management is horrible and I feel for such a highly certified\ educated employee that I am under paid.
good,Honeywell is a stable company with record profits over the last 5 quarters. The practice of force reduction to expect more of a reduced force has taken its toll on the employees. More and more full time Honeywell employees are actively searching daily for a new position at other companies.
good,I have the ability to work at a even pace. Training could be improved. I do enjoy my co-workers and other staff members. There is a sense among some of the staff that we are in this together

good,In case you need to build your career in a BPO industry it is one of the best companies to start with. The long term career is not well suited here due to prolonged night shifts that does not help with the work life balance.
good,"Honeywell was at one time a company that I would have considered to be preeminent in its desirability as an employer. Today, the company has been in a long-term cycle of driving results in a low growth business environment, which means it increasingly relies on reducing cost to drive operating income. This essentially means off-shoring jobs and reducing staff, which has resulted in greater workloads particularly for US staff."
good,Long time employer with ability to promote within. Internal postings given first concideration. Experiance is value.
good,"It is necessary some changes in the managers to avoid extra work, and complete schedule."
good,Neat technologies.  Hard-working people. Proximity to Clearwater Beach makes for fun in the sun.   You will enjoy working here.
good,"There is no work life balance at Honeywell, it is expected that you are available 100% of the time. Missed family vacations and  expected to respond to emails/phone calls at all times of the day. Benefits were well above average. Compensation was inline with industry."
good,"The work is challenging and the problems faced very unique. The local workforce builds upon one another. Lower level management is focused on producing for the customer and getting the job done, which is good; upper level management seems more focused on setting an example for investors than improving their work force, however."
good,Good place to work I only left due to moving states. Typical Day would include loading and unloading chemicals and tape production
good,"We would have a saftey meeting to start the shift off. Sometimes it would be relevant, other times it wouldn't be relevant. I enjoyed working with my co-workers."
good,Management is not very creative with regards to innovative ways to move the company forward. Development and R&D lags behind industry leaders.
good,Honeywell is a great place to start a career. Very advanced and challenging work invironment. Products are very sophisiticated.
good,"I loved working at HoneyWell as an shipboard mechanic! The culture is wonderful and the in-office perks are cool. From my experience on the ship, I can see that there are lots of opportunities for growth!"

good,learn many skills in air craft overhauling the landing system but moving up in the company want happen. worked there for ten years and had to make a choice to move on. Management was not good at all and the company gets worse every year.
good,"During my tenure at Honeywell, I was able to develop and grow as a leader.  Being responsible for a unit was challenging and gave me the opportunity to exhibit my leadership and problem solving skills.  I developed a camaraderie with my employees and co-workers that I value to this day."
good,"great people to work with, management helps out on machines, good pay decent benefits. Very family oriented. It is a french company so sometimes its difficult to understand some of the management. The owners take pride in this company and make visits quite frequently."
good,"Honeywell is a great company to work for.  They have very competitive salaries, benefits and opportunities.  They will help pay for your schooling as long as you are performing at work on your yearly reviews.  It is a very goal/task orientated environment that has little to no time for horse play or loss of focus.  When you work at Honeywell you will work your entire day and it can be a very draining environment as many departments are very high stress roles.  Many of the jobs have great opportunities for travel across the globe.  If you are able to position yourself correctly you can have a long lasting career with Honeywell."
good,"Fine. nothing special. I recommend to people who like a big company. Very global, and the work can be demanding. The bosses can be good or bad depending on your luck"
good,Nice facility but terrible schedule and hours.  It is a long day full of pointless checks which do not impact security at all but asked to be done by management.
good,saw a lot of people working hard and some others walking around doing nothing .overall it was a good place to work at until I got layed off.
good,Fortune 500 hundred company. Great benefits and career opportunities. Equal employer along with supportive management. Empowers employees to succeed.
good,"A good mix of age groups that can learn from each other. Most people are set in their ways but can be suspicious of change. It is part of a very large organisation and therefore some policies/structures are for different cultures which can lead to hesitancy to changes but overall policies, especially safety orientated, are subject to acceptance. Changes to work practice for organisation restructuring requirements are usually smooth. Changes in management,either by promotion or appointment, usually brings it's share of suspicions and fears due to the culture of the workforce which is to be expected. New ideas/structures or policies take time to accept and implement but are for the common good for all. It is a very interesting place to work which in itself brings it's own challenges and the mindset to deal with them but overall an interesting place to work."
good,I was employed by Honeywell for 35 years and I'm very grateful for the opportunities that were provided to me.  I now look forward to applying my skills and experience in other areas where I might make a difference.

good,understand requirements and proceed to solve the problem or design the required part(s). schedule and run 3D printers for the necessary job. my plastics knowledge improved with understanding how molds are designed and what is required of the parts. I would say the hardest part of the job was the pressure to get product designed and ready for production in the scheduled time frame. most enjoyable would be seeing the finished parts
good,"Same concept everyday. Great coworkers, hardest part of the job is communication. The most enjoyable day at work is the free lunches."
good,"Honeywell follows government policies, and is a very diverse work place. I enjoy the people I work with and the people I am still meeting on a day to day basis."
good,Honeywell is a contemporary American Corporation that features a large blend of Aerospace and industrial technologies and products.
good,The company suffered from a clear direction and overly inundated with middle management. Products were often pushed out to production with out having been put through the proper first article procedure. Which led to rebuilding units multiple times.
good,good job for the pay and benefits. too much overtime due to being understaff at the facility.Not enough employees to get the job done in a timely manner
good,"Good products"
good,Employees were told on a weekly basics that when china could produce a spark plug at 6 cents every line in the plant was going to be shipped out. What a nice place to work for.

good,"I am very much thankful to my previous company, as I learnt a lot of things about management at there, and also I got various experience regarding how to make coordination between the employees and management. But I felt that there is not more space for me to enhance my career, that's why."
good,"Uma misto de gratidão e decepção..."
good,"I'm thankful for the contacts I was able to make, improvements I was able to perform, bringing new process documents to be used, convert paper files to a server, design water systems in the plant.  My work spoke for itself as I was promoted twice holding three positions while working for Honeywell.  I was published by the company for an improvement in performing a Process Hazard Analysis that was missed for the 63 years of being open.  I was sent out to receive my EPA Universal Refrigeration License which I did earn and have.  I was also asked to take part in many different management training courses and I'm now certified in those specific management styles."
good,"Working for Honeywell is much like working for the government."
good,No chance for advancement.  Co workers are some of the best I have ever worked with. No annual increase this year. No room to grow.
good,"I coordinate a interdepartmental team consisting of engineers, assemblers, and schedulers to build innovative products in the aerospace field. I also manage the procurement of materials and the budget for those materials on a daily basis.

good,"Honeywell is an multinational company that produces a variety of products, engineering services for a wide variety of customers. Work culture is very good."
good,Lots of projects.  Some non-related to your department.  Too much travel.  Sometimes you get tied to a project and cannot move on to other projects for career advancement.  You do learn a lot within the projects.
good,Every day starts with a stand up meeting to ensure projects are on track. Each and every elements of Six Sigma and HOS are given utmost importance.
good,"A lot of work that needed done, but a supervisor that was not willing to get it done."
good,"No bad company to work for, the only downside is that the company is not hiring permanent employees anymore. Overall it is a huge and positive learning experience. The environment is very technical and people that works at this place is very knowledgeable. They spend a lot of time in the details and their product is superior to standard."

Models were tough to sell in a very competitive field. Some of the models were scrapped and again more people were let go. However, core business of avionics is always strong."

There may be various conference calls, either with internal business or operational teams or to negotiate terms with suppliers.

good,"i inspected, packed, run vaious machines, computer work did 5s every day, ran tester machinery, i learned new things every day, management was good, my co-workers and I got along very well, the hardest part of my job was when things did not follow in order, the most enjoyable part of my job was when everyone did there job and I did my job to the best of our abilitys"
good,Was a supervisor and after our o700 meeting did reports for the most part of the day.
good,"learn customer service, learn trouble shooting skills problem solving"
good,It was a great learning experience.
good,"Positive,very good Environment.Good Managemnet,Coordination and training"
good,• The work day was never typical.
good,"Decent job, just not much room for advancement, good people to work with, health benefits are terrible"
good,"Team building and mentoring. Driving key initiative to support customer requirements, quality, and delivery. Supplier management and material cost take out."
good,Input PMCS information onto spreadsheets that I created per UIC for accountability purposes. Assist with any other assigned tasks from manager.
good,Pretty fun place with a lot of attention to detail. SAP training was great. AC controlled facility.
good,"A typical day at work for me is chaotic. I will work with the international group of Gear bids for Dubai, or Peru, then it may be working with the US Military on specs for their gear. I will often work directly with the bidding and contract dept reviewing bid documents and executing same. I have 15 internal Sales people, I work with on daily basis and numerous Distributors. I will interface with IT dept directly managing data, developing a external Web Spec Writer."
good,Everyone here keeps to themselves and there is very little team building or morale activities. They give regular reviews and increases.
good,"Overall flexible in working hours, good supporting teams in all aspects."
good,"working as part of a team in the process of aircraft wheel repair and overhaul I worked in severl areas of the process, including incoming inspection, dismount and built as well as assisting logistics with in incoming and out going of product. I gained skill in team work and working as a individual as well as computer skills with the SAP program and hand skill of using tools in disassembly and assemble of the wheel."
good,"stock inventory in the morning, and package products for shipping in the afternoon"
good,Very interesting place to work. Would like to see the administrative department be a part of more trainings and job advancements.
good,"Great place to work, clean, friendly and benefits........."
good,"I was brought in as a contractor to schedule the PWB test bed just after the actual manufacture and assembly of the PWBs was outsourced to Mexico and China. Calculations had to be done to create safety stock due to transit time from China and Mexico. Made decisions regarding extra outside processing for certain models based on customer specification. Created, documented, distributed schedules and priorities for all associated operations from receiving through final testing. Fast paced, challenging and fun work environment. My position was supposed to be eliminated after 6 months. My stay with Honeywell as a contractor extended to 2 full years. During my last month of employment I created a desktop work instruction for a veteran employee that was assuming my responsabilities. The manual provided pictures or printscreens and instructions regarding the use of Oracle 11i to create schedules as well as the calculations needed to maintain safety stock."
good,I liked the people here because we were all ex-military people and you can't go wrong when you work with others that have done the same thing as you.
good,Professional team setup.
good,Hard working days
good,"It used to be a great place to work with end of year bonuses. Unfortunately at this current time there are no bonuses or overtime. Since Honeywell had bought our company, positions have been eliminated."
good,This company had been completely restructured when I arrived. It was a very painful merger and the management was precarious at best.
good,"Attrition rate was to high, but after revamping the screening/hiring process along with leadership training that number decreased."
good,"Good people. Coworkers were great. Management changed about every year and got a new org chart more often than that. Never was able to ""settle in"". Really liked the work we did, but never got to finish before the ""next big thing"" happened"
good,"My 1st line manager was an excellent mentor.  Not only a mentor but he showed a great interest in the investment and the happiness of the staff.  He made sure to provide all of the tools necessary to succeed. However, at times progress and morale was damaged by upper management due to failure to make decisions in a timely manner as needed, running the organization too lean and making abrupt decisions to show a better bottom line that was not beneficial to the day to day functions.  Its hard to juggle 3 full time jobs and maintain all 3 at a level of excellence."
good,"While the entry level pay is great, the excessive overtime makes it had to recommend. Large turnover rate and lack of necessary tools and information to properly learn equipment."
good,"I worked as a contractor for Honeywell Aerospace for 3 and a half years, and in that amount of time I went from a temp to hire, to a contractor, to another contractor, and all in the same department. The relationship between Honeywell and the contractor I worked for was strained and it permeated everything in our location. It became a tough work environment, you might even say a toxic environment. A lot of forced overtime due to increased, dare I say unreasonable, demands. Now, not all of this is Honeywell's fault, but much of it was. I loved the work, I enjoyed most of the people I directly worked with, but the management team was a whole other story. Needless to say, I was both heartbroken and relieved to say goodbye."
good,Lots of good programs and platforms in place to help find answers quickly; but they're also constantly changing.  Part of the challenge is learning how to use them as well as making sure everyone else is on board.
good,"was a nice place to work, hours were nice, i had a family emergency and as a result i was told not to come back, the management could be more considerate"
good,"The environment at Honeywell was predominantly fast-paced so you must be able to multitask and pay attention to detail to give good customer support to customers throughout North America.  Also, my office provided 24/7 support so I was always on-call to help if I could."
good,Overall a good place to work if you can get hired on.  A lot to learn if you aren't familiar with building valves.  Lots of people with years of experience.
good,"Company is so large it fails to recognize some of its measurement systems which impede production and quality."
good,Opportunity to work with a leader in the process and industrial automation projects field.  They look for people with technical knowledge and software programming aptitude.
good,"I worked there for 3 years, while it wasn't a bad place to work everyone in middle management was so scared of losing their jobs they wouldn't think things through before doing them, lots of unsafe practices. But overall it was decent job."
good,"work night shift , operated die cast machines, work with aluminum at high temperature  from 800 degrees to 1200 degrees , operate different types of die cast machines."
good,"I enjoy working at Honeywell, the staff is very helpful the managers are strict and deadlines are crucial. The environment was great for testing. The hardest part in the job was finding the stuff needed for testing since everything in the Lab was a bit messy and all over the place."
good,"I enjoyed my position at Honeywell as a test technician. Hard working ten hours a day the job require longer hours and the stress level is very high, the management team I worked with was lack of experience and professionalism. They push people to work more overtime to get the products done, the hardest part of the job was making sure everything was up to spec and would be shipped on time to the customer. Benefits are ok, high deductibles, Poor raises only 1 to 2 % a year."
good,Honeywell is a good company with a diversity in employee’s.  Management at the Cartersville Georgia facility is rather poor. I personally enjoyed working on the floor with all the working line personnel but found dealing with management to be challenging and unreasonable.
good,"The people at Honeywell really made up for the low pay, long hours, and hard commute to get from my town to Renton. I was incredibly grateful for the training and experienced team."
good,"Worked 12 hour shifts in a production facility, had to work unpaid on days off to cover for other people's vacations, received small bonuses despite being rated highly (most of the bonus money went to management), very hostile work environment between company and union, the business the plant practiced in was tanking globally"
good,"Typical days work is very interesting and challenging.  However Upper Management makes too many decisions that lower level people should make and benefits continue to be taken away form the employees."
good,Amount of time in office is less than told. Onsite work is long and usually out of the way causing longer commutes than anticipated. Company utilizes foreign workers more than local engineers which causes large communication issues that could be easily avoidable.
good,"Pros"
good,A empresa é americana e a cultura é muito boa. Tem educação EAD muito boa.
good,Enjoyed my 14 years @ HON.  Promoted twice.  Above average benefits.  Good online/self-pace learning program.  Nice 401k with matching + pension.  Would go back
good,"Great place if you're starting a career. Wealth of knowledge and support from the division and corporate levels. The bad thing is very little opportunity for raises. Advancement but without increase in pay. Medical benefits are atrocious. Great if your starting out, learn to run programs the right way, but don't stay. Learn a great management system and take the tools and leave, because you will never get a huge raise or bonus."
good,working is interesting as new things to learn and new system are going on development for better options. Sytems are smart and intelligent. New development are as demand of this era and future also.
good,"we was not allow to speak other language other then english this was  termination for Managment to the workers , not enough training when is about forklift operator, you have to learn fast and practice in your own until you get better, this is not really honeywell this is the contractor side KUENE-NAGEL ."
good,Good growth opportunity and compensation. Unflexible life and work balance without telecommuting option. Diverse job options to select from and training opportunity provided.
good,Job security sucked numerous reduction in force with not knowing who was next to go. Saw some senior managers and engineers let go. Pretty much gutted the whole supervisory staff in a 1 year period due to reduction in force programs.
good,Friendly people.  Everyone willing to help.  Liked to go to work everyday.  Paid for my college tuition until I was laid off.  Great benefits.  Good place to work.
good,"Challenging, fast paced can be rewarding.  Working hours are many, stress is high, often assigned goals are unachievable.  Overall a good place to work though advancement is tough unless you are willing to change roles."
good,"Stressful, layoffs every December, high turn over in management, they hired unqualified people that slacked off and did not do their jobs.  High pay.************************************************"
good,Honeywell corporate finally made it's way into safety product business and it became all about Wall Street. Turnover is/was extremely high and customer service has become dismal.
good,Honeywell was struggling with the business where I worked and it made for a stressful experience that didn't feel like it had much of a future.  They had some good process and I did learn some things while there.
good,"Busy, too much to do, stretch goals were daily based on the work initiatives in front of you. Expectations were high but so was our results. We achieved but we had to if we wanted to survive the culture, the driving force, the environment. Hardest part of the job was work life balance, the best part was stretching beyond our means and realizing we can do more than just a job at any company we work at - if we care enough to try."
good,"The Hardest Part Is Working In Certain Neighborhoods."
good,"Very smart and capable work teams, leaders are aggressive to achieve business results.  Strong culture of process and continuous improvement.  Heavily matrixed org structure with multiple stakeholders."
good,"Had a great experience working for Honeywell, benefits are great and people too. Their set processes are difficult to change.  I'm all about the customer, however, working for this company i was mentally obligated to choose customer or internal bureaucracy, I chose customers!!"
good,"Needs new management but did learn a lot of stuff got certified om forklift and cherry picker, learn more things become dependent lead more employees learned more stuff"
good,High passed work environment were financial goals need to be met even though financial constraints were in place that caused delivery of program forecast very difficult and changes could not be made inside planning timefence.
good,une grande lattitude au niveau décision mais aussi un grand manque au niveau des évaluations et des améliorations.
good,"As a contractor, I was dismissed without a given reason. There are management problems and a person I speak with regularly reports that there still are. Not a relaxed environment -the atmosphere in Redmond Honeywell feels rigid."
good,"Management has drove to an on-site collaborative environment.  The ever changing world requires teams to be more agile which is enabled by implementing ""sprint"" type activities in the development process."
good,Fast pace job that can be stressful at time. Safety comes first. coworkers are very friendly and hang out outside of work. You have the opportunity to learn a lot of skills.
good,Came to Allied because 40 hours of annual learning was REQUIRED.  I stayed because of the many opportunities to improve the company's performance for the benefit of customers and shareholders alike.
good,"Retention of talent is of no concern and no realization that constant departures creates stress and workload problems for those who stay committed regardless of the excessive workload.  Talks about work/life balance is honored when your work, aka the workload for two departures, is completed."
good,Extremely stressful environment but learned a lot of credit issues and negotiating  contracts and getting clients to payoff their credit lines in exchange for releasing shipments.
good,"Good support of career growth, and diversity of work.  However, overall benefits have eroded significantly.  Also, there is a sense of fear around job security."
good,Honeywell creation company is developing factory. after 2 year company become the all fit in man power and correct work flow. There is no some mind relaxation.
good,Honeywell still has some changes that need to be implemented. Employees are still underpaid & underappreciated. The CEO & higher ups are more concerned with money in their pockets than the employees.
good,"Honeywell has one of the worst workplace environments that I have ever seen. All cubicles are open (hot) seating, you are not allowed to personalize a cubicle and must leave it empty at the end of every day. This was in force up through the first level of management. Eventually 80% of the engineering workforce was working from home if possible. To combat this the corporate management decreed that working from home was no longer allowed. "
good,a typical day was the same activity each day so it did not challenge me because of my previous career which ended due to company closing due to outsourcing.  Most enjoyable was working with people there.  Management was good but as a temp that was the hardest part of the job.
good,HoneyWell is good  company.I learned so many things in this company .like troubleshooting the backup failures and fixing the problems .Nice management in Honeywell .Workplace culture is good..
good,"you are expected to give 120% so the project manager can get the bonus, but you don't  get to share in the bonus. After job is done, you have to reapply to other Honeywell locations to get your job again."
good,"Fortune 500 company, renowned brand, growing significantly in its own domain. "
good,"Stressful, with minimum rewards.  Every job was behind schedule and over budget.  The prime contract was with Boeing, who was very demanding and changed requirements often without adequate compensation."
good,"Team together as a whole are very dedicated and work together and get good results. We always commit what we have made."
good,Honeywell is a great place to work where Engineers are put to work on highly demanding and challenging  projects. Honeywell aerospace deals with providing solutions to Aerospace industry.Great place to learn concepts of DO-178 B/C. The  work place culture is highly work oriented. Hardest part of the job is that it gets really crunch at times when milestones come. The most enjoyable part of the job is the varied range of tasks you get to do as an engineer for the organisation. You get to involve in various steps of the product certification as an V&V engineer.
good,Overall very good work life balance. Very good job culture. Management and leadership needs a little more focus on future oriented planning. Job satisfaction is good.
good,"Following a decade of outperformance, Honeywell's new Five-Year Plan focuses on continued innovation, enhanced customer value, ..."
good,OK place to work; benefits are constantly being trimmed to follow industry trends and the company seems to always be in state of reorganization.  Product development take a long time.
good,"Started working here directly after college. Loved my coworkers and group. Eventually there was a management shift for the group, and a general downsizing. I would have stayed, otherwise. Enjoyed the work, but was a little too compartmentalized, so a little unfulfilling."
good,"Best place to work, Flexible Timing Friendly environment (varies according to Line of business) Much better salary compared to Other IT industry."
good,Work life balance not great if you're linked to manufacturing. Pay is ok but the hours are expected on weekdays and weekends almost all the time. Specially for quarter end.
good,"Talented workforce, dedicated and hardworking employees.  Little work life balance.  Long work hours.  No raises or opportunities for advancement.  Too many reorganizations, RIFs and furloughs."
good,It is really suitable company for the freshers to get qualified training which will help all to get job confidence at any cost.
good,"Pros:"
good,"I have earned multiple certifications within the plant in units such as Tankfarm, Waste Water Treatment, and the new Apollo unit currently being constructed. A typical day includes primarily writing permits and preparing equipment for contract or maintenance personnel to perform work tasks on. Didn't receive much formal training as most of the training I've gotten has been self induced."
good,"Honeywell at Toronto has great location, great management and nice people to work. Benefits are not as good as other companies. Salary is just average."
good,"Day starts with the meeting with the team to review the status of tasks, discussing issues and escalations where issues need resolution."
good,I learned alot about responsibilities. I managed a group of people to build and ship out c300 cabinets. Management was not were i expected it to be for a fortune 500 company.
good,Great company to work for.  They are fair and willing to help you outside of the work environment.  Work day stars at 0600 and ends at 1430.  Majority of personnel really enjoy this concept.
good,"The work and the work environment are excellent.  The new supervision has no knowledge of the business, most have never worked aircraft or electronics.  They care way to much about getting products out on time instead of the quality and MTBF.  They also care little about work life balance.  That is only in one shop.  The company in general is a pretty good place to work.  Benefits are not the best but they are good.  Pay is good but a bit below national standards.   Co-workers are GREAT!"
good,"With Government Contracts to last for many years to come, job security is practically guaranteed (unless of course you are a contracted hire). However, with management focused on achieving goals for the month, work-life balance is hard to maintain as you'll find yourself at work for 44+ hours a week (this is expected of you)."
good,"Overall work experience was ok for the most part, great co-workers and manager. As a contractor the pay was borderline minimum wage."
good,Honeywell in Groveport Ohio is a great place to work. They offer plenty of hours for those who want to work more. The pay is in the range of the regions average pay. A typical day at work for me is I would go to the department I was needed in and work there and perform any task that was given to me in an efficient amount of time. I learned many things working for Honeywell. I learned how to use and apply many transaction codes for SAP. I learned how many of the processes of the warehouse function. And I learned how to operate new pieces of equipment. The management in the company fluctuated frequently. Leads and supervisors were transferred from department to department. The overall workforce within the warehouse had a negative response to not receiving a pay increase this year and the constant 50-65 hour work weeks which dropped moral withing the facility. The most enjoyable part of my just was the self satisfaction of getting the job done faster and more accurate than most and getting the chance to learn new things and getting the opportunity to apply what I had learned.
good,I enjoyed working with the engineers and staff at.Not bad place to work at all.Good company and nice environment with more opportunity to work
good,"Your words or comments about working conditions or things to be changed is always heard and considered."
good,"Worked with other buyers to procure parts, audited and reported financial numbers.  Assisted in building a software to better request quotes."
good,"HoneyWell always has advancement oppertunities, very fair wages and a great level of team work on hands. Working in previous factories HoneyWell was a great experience, always having advancement oppertunities and great learning expereinces the people at HoneyWell were great people to become friends with."
good,"Since retiring from the military, this is the best job I've had.  Hours are great and coworkers are on the same page and have the same get it done attitude."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is really just having a good old time and being around different people and getting know them more
good,Mentally challenging place to work. Learned volumes of knowledge in the assembly of circuit cards and loved every minute of it. Dedicated manufacturing workforce with a lukewarm leadership running the show. Job security is shaky and advancement is stagnant.
good,"Typical day is never established as there are always hot issues that consume most of your day.  Management in most cases have a grasp on the going ons of the company however lack discipline within their teams."
good,"very good day at work.good communication on all levels,good management and good pay also and very good times to work fits in with school times"
good,"Pricing department works hard and co workers are great to work with "
good,"Although when hired they speak and talk to you as though you need to know electronics repair and its capabilities of equipment operation for Marine Corps type of comm/shop items; the truth is, that you will be no more than an installer of radio equipment to military vehicles. Also management tries to plan maintenance which they always prove they are not so good at doing, then rely on the personnel to make up for their mis-management. Somehow its always the workers fault things did not go as they planed.  The work is not hard, hours are good (6-2:30) pay is generous, but o-boy the management is not employee friendly; they play favorites…… Good luck….."
good,"Contract was up, and the company was getting slow at that time. They had temp workers, but we were all eventually let go. Nice air conditioned building to work with, and great people to work with also."
good,good people good supervisors this right here is easy nothing hard about it. the only thing is the training they dont give you the proper training how is suppose too.
good,"Honeywell acquired what was Vocollect inc. in 2013."
good,"it is easy work but management is not good, decent place enjoyable when the management is being managers and not friends. the most enjoyable part of my job is working on base with all the shops"
good,"I really enjoyed working here, all of my family has worked for this company at one point or another. They use to do a lot for their employees. Seemed like every year I worked there the company got worse and worse to work for."
good,Ok type. Good work life balance. Good for embedded skill. Not much scope for application development. Good for freshers to join this company
good,"I liked working at Honeywell. Unfortunately my position was eliminated after the financial crash (and also losing a major government contract due to an incompetent move made by corporate sales). "
good,"This job taught me how to be patient , how to drive different types of machines safely, the pay wasnt that great, but learning new thingsthat  will take me a lot further in life is priceless"
good,"fast paced environment, hours and location is great as well including positive people who help make a difference in working as a team."
good,"I worked for Honeywell for 23 years. That job helped me raise my family and I am very thankful for the time that I was employed there. There were several things that I wish had been different in the company, but there are many things that made it fantastic to work there."
good,I've been at Honeywell for 5 years now and have learned a great deal more about distribution by switching industries.  ADI has polished off the skills that I learned at Ingram and I am very grateful to have spent 5 years with such a good company.
good,"A typical day at work consist of computer work, customer service. Working with LGE customers. Managing payroll for our office and field employees"
good,"You will learn a lot and be presented with ample opportunity if you are a strong performer, but environment is demanding on your personal life."
good,"high stress, immediate boss may know nothing about your job and provide worst possible advice.  keep excellent documentation, people get thrown under the bus.  "
good,"Extensive cleaning of trains and train yard, stocking trains with necessary toiletries and making train accommodating to customers. Training of new hires. Shampooing of carpets as well as a special assignment."
good,"Honeywell is a great company and my work is related to Honeywell Security Systems. I help technicians to install, wire, program and troubleshoot these devices. That also require me to work with these devices and test them in real time scenarios."
good,The job isnt to hard and have plenty of work to do. The money is not that good for the amount of work you do or knowledge it takes to do it all and to many inside work politics.
good,"My daily routine consists of reviewing my projects, follow up of orders that are due soon, place new orders, update the share point site, review the forecast with field service leader and identify risk or opportunites for each."
good,I learned a great deal during my years at Honeywell.  I started within the Customer Service arena and when business product lines increased a need for Traffic with the York site was needed.  I took the position to lead the Traffic team and embraced the Import Export Movements/Documentation as well as Domestic Moves.  Ten years ago I was asked to train on the Trade aspects and have found my niche with Trade Compliance and Import Exports.
good,Very large organization with many processes and procedures to follow. Not a sales focused company knowing it sales that drives their business.
good,"Journée de travail typique: réunion de type scrum de 30 minutes, développement de fonctionnalités de thermostats, résolution de problèmes."
good,The work -life balance is good. Friendly and productive work atmosphere.
good,"It was a great company with very lively collegues."
good,"learned machining of aerospace parts."
good,"My day starts at about 8:35, I am working at the sales counter answering phones, dealing with customers coming into the branch to order and pick up product. The environment is really busy and there is not much down time, so any time that it may be slow is a good time to catch up on things that need to get done. We are there for 9 hours and have a 1 hour lunch time. Many days we have online training that needs to be completed every two weeks, so most lunches are for 30 minutes and the rest is training. We are about  8 people that work together in the branch."
good,"Developement of Softwares"
good,"start work on whatever 12 hour shift im on do to a mandatory meeting each morning or evening and get design my strategy for that day and start work . working the go-getter in maneuver racks containing porcelain forms around within a space so that the rollers who roll beads on them can have access and for those who dip these said forms can have access also when its time for the machinist to go on break I relieve them and take over their jobs until they return from break.   the whole entire time that im doing this I have on a gas mask a hard hat , steel boot shoes and safety glasses it gets up to 130 degrees in this dip room"
good,"Winning Cost preparation for NTPC in tight schedule is challenge,"
good,Middle and Upper management are focused on the Kaizan program looking for ways to make the work flow more streamlined and faster moving with an appropriately sized staff to handle the workload. The crew chiefs and coworkers in the cells are receptive and helpful sharing knowledge at all times. Overtime is very sternly requested of everyone often but nothing is forced.
good,"Very professional non-micro managing, over all great place"
good,"Well run and managed place to work for and also very good training"
good,"I love the technology part of the job. But the compensation part is not comparable as my involvement. "
good,It very useful for me because i learnt a lot. may not be of great value for experienced professionals
good,"highly sales driven no organisation ,great place to work and learn"
good,"The company went through a lot of up's and down's while I was there and it got to the point where they were pushing us out the door before they closed. Especially there were a lot of lies being told from management to the employee's. But altogether pay was good, got hectic at some points but managed to do my job according to standards."
good,"easy place to work, no benefits but top pay so if you're looking for a place to get a pay check from until the economy comes back this is your place"
good,Working at Honeywell was both challenging and fun. I was in involved in many aspects of finance which was challenging and rewarding. The most enjoyable part of my job was the company sponsored fun events
good,"System operator, and maintenas, project , shift enggg, Iam control -cctv ,fire panel, smoke detector, access control.,Vesda, rpdent"
good,"Typical work day if full with demand, priorities, projects. Time sensitive paperwork and reports to generate. I am organize which works best in this atmosphere. Management is far too busy to scrutinize anyones work habits as long as your work is done and no one is complaining. Little contact or relationship with co-workers unless required. Everyone has a heavy work load."
good,"Honeywell é uma conceituada empresa do ramo automotivo, com bastante tecnologia e muito bem estruturada"
good,A manejar personal a micargo y el liderazgo.
good,"*Control room operator monitoring a complex chemical reaction on DCS, with several field inspections throughout the shift."
good,"A good place to work. The jobs were fast paced, but fairly easy to understand a do in a short period of time. Supervisor were easy to work for and to talk to."
good,"Honeywell is a large company that has a lot to offer their employees. There are multiple locations in the Phoenix area.  It is a good place to work, has decent benefits and opportunities for advancement."
good,Plat moc neodpovídá náročnosti práce. většinou 3 smenny provoz
good,"individual contributor role make impact on decision making ability, Global position role will help in flexible work hrs, but some time meeting at night. Very good work-life balance."
good,"Competitive work culture."
good,I typical day has 6 meetings will a few hours of day to day activities. Unrealistic stretch goals. Great stock match. Health care has a high deductible.
good,"Honeywell provides many opportunities for training and development. The home/work life balance can be difficult, but the variety of work you do is satisfying. Compensation is very good as well."
good,Procurement to Receiving and the Accounting Staff at Sister Sites helped in getting things resolved and being proactive to prevent problems from occurring.
good,"The colleagues are lovely and it feels like a family. "
good,"Honeywell was, I'll stress was, very supportive of a work from home environment however, changed course and does not allow any work from home anymore. That's when I lost interest in working for Honeywell."
good,"I like the supervisors they were very understanding. But a lot of turn over here. One moment we’re good the next day overtime with no warning. A lot of people have families and don’t need these working conditions are somewhat unfair. "
good,"They seem to change commission structure every year. Unless you close some big deals, it's difficult to make quota. Only people that have big accounts actually make it."
good,"People in Honeywell is the reason why I choose to stay and work with them during my years in Honeywell. "
good,The company is not financially buoyant and old and experienced staff is forced to resign out of frustration. The administration appears not to be interested about staff.welfare.
good,I only worked for Honeywell Aviation for nine months. I therefore did not get a very solid understanding of what was available to me. They seem to over emphasis lean practices even in areas that have low throughput but very high variability in products made or repaired and overhauled.
good,You walk in expecting to work 10 hours everyday and mandatory 8 hours on Saturday. That was the biggest issue. Other then that you got to pick the people you wanted to work on a truck with if you wasn't working by yourself. You're constantly working so you're never bored and the management was fine.
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo solo que nos faltaba motivarnos mas y que reconocieran nuestro trabajo.
good,Working at Honeywell is not a surety.  You have to take a lot of inbound and outbound calls  from utility customer's. We hardly get any information or  help from  Management because they're  outsourced. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people that I work with. Management only thinks about money and where they can outsourced there  jobs for less money
good,"Honeywell was a great place to work and I tried multiple times to get back into the fold, after I voluntarily separated.  Found many problems with advancement due to being located in one of the more productive satellite offices within Aerospace.  Still desire to work there again someday, if time permits the opportunity but I won't be holding my breath.  There's an upper level management plan for the business that is deeply safeguarded from letting the minions know the full plan.  This is normal, but it is also disastrous if your location is not near the corporate office for that division"
good,"For the most part Honeywell is a helpful, teaming environment. Pay is competitive, benefits are average, and work life balance is good. Stock performs well."
good,"Cito a constante mudança como positivo e negativo."
good,Good place to work but a lot of stress goes with the job.  Honeywell does try to be worker friendly but because of workloads this is not always possible.
good,"I liked the hours 6-2, no lunch but you receive 10 and 15 minute breaks. the people I worked with was very good to me. Good training, relaxed atmosphere"
good,"Unfortunately, not a good place for work life balance or growth in salary, there is a good opportunity for learning through training's."
good,"I arrived at Shreveport after the departure of some senior management. The new on site management struggled with the corporate management style also. Soon after my departure, they was more major changes in both corporate and on site management.The site was in a cultural flux and I moved on."
good,"Not as customer focused as in the past. Very strict internal metric measurements vs, customer satisfaction metrics which are really not looked at as closely. Autonomy to the point of getting little or no guidance from a manager and then being reviewed as if they had full knowledge"
good,"Fast paced environment, Team building and on the job training. On the job advancement. Competitive wages and Holiday pay. Open door policy. Benefits package needs improvement"
good,Reduction in work force happened so quickly with in a day that there was very little time to prepare to find another job ASAP. The job training was very intense but very through.
good,Large company with a dynamic workplace found in almost any country in the world. Pay is great plus benefits. Management is poor though and needs revamping.
good,"Honeywell offers a decent work culture and good career opportunities. Depending on skills, one gets opportunity to work on cutting edge technologies. The work life balance is not very good. No much benefits other than salary."
good,"intense scheduling environment"
good,Good exposure to some of the latest technology.  Good global exposure.  Work days were always different which kept it interesting.  Great people to work with always willing to help each other out.
good,Honeywell automation india Ltd is a leading company in the industry and has a great reputation for the quality of the work and working environment is very nice
good,"Door entry and access control install carried out without any interference from other contractors."
good,"Honey will provides quality products a person can be proud to represent and for the work you do, the results can be seen. The work is high paced, but there is good opportunity for placement."
good,Really enforced employees contribute to new ideas such as continuous improvement of various processes throughout the plant. That was very encouraging and also gave employees a reason to engage.
good,"The majority of my day was spent creating forecasts, inserting information into SalesForce.com and in meetings with sales management.  My Federal Govt. manager and collegues were wonderful to work with, hard working and highly productive.  The engineers that worked with me were the best in our industry.  My customers, once a relationship had been built, were loyal as long as we kept our promises and met their requirements."
good,"working with HONEYWELL was a great opportunity to learn, learn is all ways a great thing to learn even if you are not getting pay enough for the job you are working for"
good,"My direct manager was good but remote. The manager I performed work for was arrogant, rude and highly emotional. The project I was assigned to suffered from lack of senior management oversight."
good,"Job security began going down and quality of life began going down soon after the CEO decided that the company would be moving towards being software focused. Too many projects with too many managers, and too little workers to keep up with the work load. Furloughs and sudden change of stock matching being only matched at the end of the year, instead of by check, is making workers feel absolutely no need to be loyal to a company that wont care for them. They are trying to force loyalty for stock options, and I can't stand to stay anymore"
good,"So large, it is hard for senior leadership to understand what is happening at employee level.   Changes are massive and not precise.  Make sense from the c-suite but results are often not what they expected.   Easy to get lost and complacent."
good,overall good..need to see the profile you work in..need to be specific about what kind of work you want to do in the company. overall good work culture
good,"Enjoyed working at Honeywell, if materials department not been relocated would still be there. During my 26 years of employment I worked 9.5 years at Tijuana plant before transferring back to San Diego, Working south of the border is nothing I would have done on my own but enjoyed the experience and met some really nice people and few forever friendships."
good,"Quality of work is good."
good,"As a packer your required to stand for long periods of the day and breaks are short. Many of the managers are pretty laid back, however their are some pretty rude ones who catch attitudes when seeking help. After a day worth of training they expect you to do the job without failure in a week worth. The hardest part about this job is standing in the same cramped space and lack of employee who seem to quit every other day. They do offer a lot of overtime for those who don't mind. Ps. You do have to clock in and out however you hours are recorded mainly through a time sheet which your responsible for if you want to get paid. For cherry pickers the life is a little more harder if your willing to be away from your families for 10-13 hours a day. I recommend this job although it can get really rough."
good,"Hired as Coldfusion devleoper, when I arrived there was no Coldfusion just taking over other projects none related to my field from another company. I did the work and left for a job more dedicated to Coldfusion"
good,Fast paced with high production requirements. Performed multiple change overs of machines to meet orders for customers. Quality checks including different measurements to produce the best spark plugs. Could be a dirty job at times but pay was very good. The hardest part of the job was machines down while trying to meet customer requirements. The best part was working with people who became family. Always time for family with company parties which included the children. We were given opportunity to have input on changes and develop new processes with approval. Great benefits with competitive salaries.
good,I tested civilian and military generators for this company and I enjoyed every minute of it but unfortunately I got laid off due to contract loses. The workplace culture was good due to the fact that they pushed safety and situation awareness quite a bit.
good,"Too much work pressure, depending on the team"
good,A typical day at work would be pretty busy and consisted of a rapid pace work environment. In which things change on a daily basis. i would rotate through multiple stations on a shift to ensuranse maximum   alertness and preparation.The day definitely kept me on my feet but made the time go by fast.I would double-check connections to ensure they math and record any discrepancies in assembly log.so mentally i had to remain focused at all times.Ienjoyed the challenge on an every day basis.
good,"A leader and innovator that started 100 years ago.. Typical progression to growth, maturity and complacency. Inward focus on operations and loss in touch with customers and partners. "
good,Work is good.. But lot of politics in the workplace. I was able to perform well in the company inspite of that the was not able to get proper rating in the company.
good,"Company had to implement several furloughs (company-wide) and layoffs due to inability to satisfy contracts with its customers.  Senior executive instability as well as confusion on program performance all the way down to engineering not meeting demands.  Unless you are willing to ""marry your job"" it is an unstable culture."
good,"a struggle to get things done due to culture, tools for getting job done  there was a strong focus on finance management. Very week in project management due to young or still learning work force."
good,Good place to work. management is supportive.Too many processes makes the work slow to finish.Good brand name. hard work is appreciated.
good,I worked as an intern in this company. It was a great experience working in the actual field. I gain a great experience doing cost analysis for the project that we were working on.
good,"Buen horario y respeto entre compañeros de trabajo."
good,"As an entry level employee I have learned a great deal of skills applicable to my field. It is a very flourishing environment. Highly interdisciplinary and multi-cultured. Have worked with internal and external customers, fast paced and results-driven tasks. We are encouraged to go above and beyond customer expectations and most of the time we deliver."
good,"Great place to work until 2001 when Allied Signal bought Honeywell.  It's just not the Honeywell ""family"" we all knew and loved.  We felt solid 99% on time deliveries.  The customer loved us.  Now there are so many furloughs, lay-offs and no increase in pay in years - Aerospace-wide across the U.S.  They want people to work hard yet there is no incentive to do so.  The worker bees make all the money for Honeywell even with all their impossible policies and procedures that only throw roadblocks in front of people.  As rich as the CEO is, he still manages to get his annual bonus while people are still making the same they did 4 years ago."
good,It's a good work place and learn a lot of knowledge. But if you have ideas that would be plus for your carrier with honeywell to get good salary hikes.
good,"Average Company."
good,"The people are fantastic, but the company is not so great. They don't compensate employees very well for the cost of living increases, are laying off often and cutting hours. All of this while increasing health insurance benefits."
good,"Lots to learn as it is a growing company. "
good,Honeywell operating plan works very well. Employees have a lot of skills. Management does not listen as they should. Management needs to be changed out.
good,"Good business processes and easy to acclimate to the environment.  "
good,"Most people there are good awesome people to work with except for a couple(husband/wife that work in the same department). They used to work on the assembly line (with no knowledge or education in the quality craft like GD&T) for the previous company that was bought over by Honeywell. QC Management was notified by other previous inspectors other than me regarding their ignorant attitude and  uneducated perspective on GD&T but it seem like favoritism kick into effect over new comer(maybe job security for both party). I'm still shock something like this could accur in this age and date especially in a reputable company like Honeywell! Any how, I took my talent elsewhere talent needed."
good,"SGS has many faults and poor communication internally."
good,"commute is fantastic, good people to work with, work overload, pay is ok, non supervised working environment is great, good managers, nice working environment"
good,The company has excellent work culture. Lot of scope for learning. The personal development and the professional goals are being met.
good,"UOP is a well respected company in the Oil and Gas industry and there is a lot of room for growth and development as most promotions come from with UOP or Honeywell. UOP was purchased by Honeywell around 2006 and has had a heavy influence ever since. "
good,"This will be completed at a later date in time."
good,"work can be exited on daily occasions, I learned how to become a better operator by participating in kaizen projects and I also do a lot of hands on. The management are a very good romodel because they can guide me to achieve my goals. Co-workers can get along with each other very well and are fun to work with, the hardest part of the job is training new people and to keep the production @ the rate. What I enjoy about my job is doing the job."
good,ran and set up Ochuma three axis lathes with Fanuc controls.
good,"At Honeywell, one can balance his work and life very effectively."
good,with them your nothing more than a number. ther is no loyalty towards the employees.
good,"A Honeywell, grupo multinacional com cultura organizacional definido, possuí processos, procedimentos, métricas e condutas admiráveis. "
good,"Honeywell offered me my position as Sustainability Service Sales Representative with the mindset that I was to focus on Sustainability and Energy Services. However after a few months went by, the focus shifted to sell all services provided by Honeywell including Building Automation, Fire, and Security systems. Every opportunity we came across would require a different skill set, understanding, and background. This was a challenging and rewarding learning environment. My mentor assisted me with these challenges and made me appreciate the many moving parts of commercial buildings. It was because of this position that I have a passion to continue working with Commercial Buildings and ensuring they are constructed, operated, and maintained efficiently for the years to come. Our territory included New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming which was also challenging. This was the toughest when my husband and I started a family. If issues arose during the sales process, management was hard to find for assistance. When these situations arose, I depended upon my local team and mentor."
good,"Health benefits are not good. Do appreciate the corpate casual culture here. Enjoy multinational facets of working with people throughout the world."
good,Work fluorine plant. All procedures and safety guidelines followed by sops. Enjoy problem solving.

good,"i learnt more"
good,You have the ability to have time off without question if there is a family problem that needs to be taken care of. A typical day is generaly slow paced. I learned a lot about how to treat employees and working in a team oriented work place. Co-workers are fun to work with and usually have good knowledge on what they are working on. The most enjoyable part of the job is the Flex-Time allowed for show up to start your 8 hours of work.
good,"Great co-workers and local management OK, A semi-professional work enviroment repairing aircrat electronics."
good,Amazing co-workers and excellent leadership team.  I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,"Great place for a newbie."
good,"# there is no typical day in sales, you can start in Paris and finish in UK, you can do emailing all day or all day in meetings ...very much depends on your agenda."
good,Audit order's from 100wt to small parcel order's. Make sure that order's are 100% audited before being shipped to our customer's. If I have downtime I go down to LTL and will help them with their auditing. Right now on Honeywell's Planning Committee. We organize and plan food potlucks/carry-in's for employee's and plan different group activitie's and set up fundraiser drives and donate money raised by employee's to local and national charity's.
good,Money was good that was about it. rotating 12 hour shift. The people on my shift were great to work with
good,I process whatever is asked of me. I've learn a few new jobs that are interesting to me.My supervisor and all cell leaders are great to work for and with.I have some personal connections with some of my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is not having anything to do to keep me busy.I enjoy being a part of a product that saves lives.
good,"Productive & Fun Workplace, but with lesser Salary. Company is very good with very bad Human Resource Management."
good,"The team works well to support eachother, we all have key accounts to look after and we liaise with Head office in france, the external sales force and internal logistics and warehouse staff, to provide the best customer service to our customers, answering queries and enquiries, logging and scheduling orders, arranging deliveries, reporting on weekly figures product sales, back order reports etc. Communications via, email telephone and face to face.

good,Areas of Experts:
good,"Honeywell CPG division and the Fram Clearfield facility was sold to another company in July 2011 and the facility was closed October 16, 2011"
good,"Vím konkrétně to, že supervizor Bartoněk na divizi elektro CCCE kryje team leadera Honzu Ločárka, který šikanuje nejednoho zaměstnance."
good,Great place to work with good challenging projects and opportunities. Management always make sure that all the employees had a relaxed and fun environment to work.

good,It is a place that was nice and exciting adventure. People that I have gotten to know we're  and still is very close. The work was not hard nor stressful.
good,"As a temporary contract employee, rating Honeywell is not especially relevant.  However, the culture and working environment is enjoyable, the work was stimulating and new knowledge was gained in products I had little previous experience."
good,"As a younger employee, Honeywell provided a good amount of opportunity and exposure to different projects and people. Growing with the company became a challenge and I did not see a ladder to climb and sought out better benefits such as healthcare, maternity leave, and 401K contribution elsewhere."
good,"Good Job with great benefits.  We supported Idaho Power for the energy efficiency programs.  Plenty of work, Plenty of fun.  The best part was the benefits.  great!"
good,"I would not no what to write about this company anymore, I have not worked there in a long time, I like working there with everyone, would maybe go back"

good,Si volvería a trabajar ahí lastima que sus contratos solo son por un año por políticas de la empresa no los renuevan
good,"Honeywell is a company with an identity crisis. Many new acquisitions of other industries have left them unsure of what their function is other than""improvement""."
good,"The work life balance is good, very good depending on your manager. The intern pay was good as well but the full time salary offer was not at all competitive with the market."
good,Work was very demanding and sometimes quite stressful. Management was good and both bad. Compensation was excellent. Benefits were great as well as the various advancement opportunities available.
good,"everyday you are learning about new device, always have to be ready to learn something new..it a fast pace job, always be ready to be sent station. the managers are term players, the co work are very nice and willing to help you with anything related to the job. need to be a quick learner. the most enjoyable the job is the co-works the manager and for the job it self..it challenging but I love challeng"
good,"I was hired three years ago by their lead project manager in charge of eastern seaboard Federal division to run a project in Harrisburg, PA. I was told that I would be full-time and agreed to salary and benefits. Because of timing, I agreed to work through a temp organization for the first month to start the project, while Honeywell caught up with the paperwork.  Two years later I was still working through the Temp.  When I was hired directly, it was as an assistant project manager and this year, a reorganization deleted my job description.  Acknowledging these facts I would be hesitant in referring Honeywell as a safe place to work."
good,"Slow paced. Work depends on government contracts, which may or may not happen. Employees are expected to find work for themselves in order to fulfill the expectation of 6.2 hours of direct (project) charging per day on average. Work is not always available. They tend to over hire based on forecasts, which are usually overly optimistic."
good,"You work with your mind and your hands. Trouble shooting keeps you alert. You are in charge of huge machines."
good,Good to be part of Honeywell. Typical day will be manange the onsite team co-ordinate with them. Lots of technical discussion. Lots of stuff to learn.

good,"Boa empresa para que quiser aceitar novos desafios. . "
good,"High demands, poor technical support, and work overload. Pay was less than average for Electronic technicians in The DC area. The marines didn't get enough money to upgrade old equipment, but it kept growing at Quantico Marine base."
good,No work structure. Management is horrible. Horrible union bringing company potential down. Communication failures company wide. Avoid at all costs unless you like red tape and playing the game.
good,Enjoyed working there. Wish to have longer contact.Excellent coworkers.The culture is amazing too. Each employee does not mind helping the other out if they are stuck.Learned a lot. Good management
good,A typical day at work was satisfying the customer with an overall completed product.  My co-workers were good to get along with and some received what you had to say to help everyone achieve the best.  The most tedious part of the job was management understand where we as hourly employees were coming from.

good,"People and management are friendly. Although the smarter you are and the harder you work, the more is expected of you while people that are less productive get away with murder. Making the rest of us work harder"
good,Management is very supportive and co workers are also good. Good work and personal life balance. More HR activities and celebrations.
good,"Honeywell is an interesting place to work. Although engineering takes a long time to release product, once they do the products are solid. I travel throughout the USA and Canada and the extensive travel is beginning to wear on my family and me."
good,Honeywell is a good place to balance the personal and professional life. But there is no scope to understand the system. With respect to the task assigned there is no need to do much brain stroming.
good,"Well managed corporation, continuing to grow through the recent recession. Diverse portfolio enables overall growth even when some markets are down. "
good,"Actuar como enlace entre la compra y la interconexión organizaciones para planificar, coordinar y aplicar estrategias que todas las actividades de la cadena de suministro relacionados con el cumplimiento de los requisitos de fabricación."

good,"Wurde zum Schluss immer nerviger zu viele Projekte,"
good,"The division of Honeywell I worked for used contract employees in  general and did not pay top wages.

good,Working in the Aerospace field for the past 20 years handling a superior customer for all their orders through Honeywell Aerospace division for the OEM production for new aircraft and aftermarket orders for aircraft already in service.
good,"Good paying job,good safe working conditions.Hardest part of job,holding Aerospace tolerances.Meeting critical hardware deadlines."
good,Technical Support Engineer taking care of system hardware and software related issue.
good,Not a bad place to work. Decent benefits. Only thing is they don't like to give pay raises every year. Starting pay wasn't so bad but an eight cent raise for the year is not going to keep me happy working there.
good,Needs a better attendance policy. But other than that it's not a bad company to work for an to become part of you learn alot of interesting things of how aircraft brake system works.
good,Was a good place to work until the young lad in charge of Aero decided to shut us down even though our facility produced more product on time and without defect than the Memphis facility does  I give Memphis five years and they’ll shut them down too
good,"Hardworking specializing in forklift operator, efficient loading of merchandise and on- time deliveries."

good,"Working at Honeywell has been a valuable experience.  Unfortunately, much time and effort is spent reacting around suppliers not being able to deliver in full on time and how that will affect customer deliveries.  I have learned to control what I can and try to not let the things I cannot control get me down.  Management is very aware of these scenarios and helpful in any way they can be to help minimize the effect these events have on production."
good,It was a very pleasant job I enjoy very much you got along very well with people they're very considerate they would help you when they could they are very nice including the boss.
good,"Typical work day consisted of coming in reading and answering emails. Every Thursday we had team meetings to go over progress on certain projects. Very flexible hours and time for family. Honeywell is a great place to learn from experienced individuals, who provide a minimal learning curve for its employees"
good,There is required overtime on off days and no paid off holidays. Insurance sucks. But the money is good. Not real sure why this is forcing me to review honeywell but here it is.
good,"I worked there many years ago and it was a good company. My manager was great, the products were good. Overall, Honeywell has a good work culture. I'd consider working for them again."
good,A typical day: good; Learned a lot; management is good; workplace culture- good; hardest part- lack of mentorship; most enjoyable part- the work. I would work there again.

I enjoyed working with many of the people and they appreciated that I would go abve and beyond to help them."
good,"Every Morning we have TAM : Daily meeting for 15 minutes where we discuss project related issues at common place."
good,unfortunately was only able to spend a years time together with this company. During this period the majority of my day was spent on the road working in low income neighborhoods attempting to establish relationships with building owners and senior homes. Was also responsible to create workshops and events to provide information to the general public. Supervised the energy audit teams while visiting work sites.
good,Great place to work at but unfortunately the location at Golden Valley MN is relocating to a different state. Bad things are that the higher up folks don't really seem to care much about employees but if you just do your job and careless it'll work out somehow.
good,This is professional place with career development opportunities. They provide work flexibility; continuous internal trainings; good benefits and very professional work environment.
good,"At repair and overhaul, everyday was something new to work on. Every year is an okay pay raise, but there are caps to each position. So the only way to get more pay is to move up in position."
good,must have liquid filling / bolwmolding experience in order to be successful. I acquired some green belt training while working there . The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the temps .

Provided documentation and reports to internal and external customers to support their product line. Worked on teams with the goal to develop and streamline processes. Worked daily to meet or exceed company goals. I enjoy working with people and getting them the best product, the best solution to their requests. My co-workers were an essential part of getting projects done, we all had our own expertise. At times one of the hardest parts of the job were finding the correct person to get data from. This was due to Honeywell being an international company and my department serviced worldwide programs."
good,"aprendizaje constante, empleo exigente al aporte y soluciones de averias y optimizacion del desempeño laboral, trato con clientes directos, supervisor de instalaciones trabajo bajo presion, buen abiente de trabajo en equipo."
good,"Not a typical here, learned something new everyday. Management was hands-off. Some co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was the long lead time on parts. The most enjoyable part of the job was the travel and all the different people I met."

good,This was a temp job try to make it a full time by showing them I was a quick learner and team player. Wanted to learn all I could and show them I would be worth hiring full time. My manager was always there to show me how to achieve a job well done. Nothing was really hard. Keeping busy was the best part of the job.

I learned how to operate machines in a manner which they could run above and beyond the call of duty, with quality parts.  Management was great, they would let me run my area, and assist and support me if needed.  Co-workers helped create a safe and pleasant work environment.  Keeping the floors clean of transmission fluids were the hardest part of the job, and the gratifying part would be understanding how important it was to deliver quality merchandise to the customers."
good,"A typical day for me at Honeywell would be me coming in and meeting up with my team on time and going over the day before to see how well we did with production and what needed to be done the following day."
good,"dispatch showed favoritism too much , every month drivers were getting something taken away , no family time , push push  push,had to use personal days just to spend time with family"
good,"I work in a professional environment with a lot of training to deepen my knowledge, in the different fields of management of finance and contract, the group is really professional as well as management"
good,"Nice and friendly people. Benefits were excellent. Great location.eyeglasses and sunglasses in some 100 countries, including the hottest names in fashion frames"
good,Work too long for the wages they pay.  However many oppotunities to advance your career.
good,"Worst leader ever, job is easy, work with amazing minds and it’s a very conservative culture with outstanding attitude. Contractors are treated like outsiders."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, buen sitio para aprender."
good,I enjoyed working with cars. I learned a lot new things about different cars. I use to drove them back and forth. It was a fun loving job for me.
good,"Honeywell es una compañia que demanda mucho tiempo del empleado pero el trabajo exitoso es reconocido. Su marcada verticalidad y poca estructura en latinoamerica hace que los reconocimientos, promociones, aumetnos de salario etc, dependan mucho de la relación con el gerente de turno.,"
good,"Tangible, rewarding experiences have been my career story that can be applied to many facets within the field of project management and applied to this open position throughout.  Logistical analysis, problem solving, 3PL, omni-channel facility design and activity (REI Facility Goodyear AZ) with measurable outcomes are what can be related to professional experiences.  "
good,"Honeywell on Botts road has too many employees for the number of desks they have. They actually are renting out other buildings to deal with the overcrowding. BTW, the bathrooms are not enough and always full of people doing their business."
good,"Hardest part of job was I had to get permits on every aspect of the job, usually spent more time on permits than the job. Spent 3 hours doing a permit to do a 30 minute job.Honeywell was a very well clean enviroment. I was able to design fillers, clean room door openers to let products in and out automatically."
good,"They have great product offering. Too any managements changes. Very poor local management and support. They are definately practicing age discrimination."
good,"No problems.  Decent place to work...if a little insular.  Lots of older techs from the previous company's merger with Honeywell.  Still, a good company to work for."
good,"Worked in many different roles over the years, growth potential is very good, I cant tell you how many great extremely smart people I had the opportunity to work for and with. Overall a great experience and a good company to work for, just like all large companies benefits continue to get cut in order to keep up with the global economy."
good,"Easy going job.  Excellent pay rates. Swing shift. Standard benefits."
good,"self starter, did what needed to be done,"
good,Great company with a lot of training and people to coach and mentor.  The benefits are okay and in line with some of the other larger companies benefits.
good,Just wasn't the right fit for me culturally. Too much of the old way of thinking about young blacks makes you feel awkward and out of place. The pay is great.
good,Not enough time to learn there S.A.P. internal software required management system. Unpredictable managers. We had two managers when I worked there. The second promoted manager was worse.
good,"An excellent work place, great facilities, excellent co-workers, great culture. Professionally demanding, challenging, however, stressful to most employees. Good management, good support. Mid to high management turnover."
good,Slow paced and knowledge sharing is suspect. Management does not get involved with people's training or do any follow ups. Co-workers can be down right offensive towards everyone. Hardest part of the job is having consistent work. The most enjoyable part of the job is that for the most part everyone leave you alone.
good,Working at Honeywell proved to be rewarding and challenging at the same time. Providing services for our military was the most rewarding  part and knowing were are helping in saving and protecting the lives of our soldiers.
good,"Honeywell was a great place to work.  It afforded me the opportunity to meet new friends, provide financial stability for my family and grow both personally and professional throughout my tenure."
good,"Good MNC in saudi Arabia"
good,"It is a place that employs a lot of temporary workers. But slow on the hiring on permanent. its 90% immigrants and refugees from other countries.  There is a big difference in how the shifts work. It was nice to meet people from other cultures the holidays were a blast with everyone coming together with their own countries food. The sewing is fast paced and professional, lots of over time."
good,Never join this company on contract.You will never be permanent
good,"Military Contractor."
good,It's danger zone contract work. There's it's about supporting the troops. 12hour work days with 1day off. There's no time for games. one must stay active with sports when ever you can find the time.
good,Is a great place to work just need more out of supervisors to take job more serious and be more organized and need to keep up getting tools to the job
good,I don't mind this job. But at the same time I would like to find a batter paying job. One that I would like to turn into a career. And even advance in. I am a very hard worker and a fast learner.
good,"Hard work in this capacity with minimal breaks.  Worked as a temp, but full-time employees were unhappy with wages, benefits, etc."
good,"Mucho por mejorar, pero no les gusta escuchar y dedicarle tiempo a las mejoras. No aprovechan la experienci de empleados que vienen de otras empresas con mejores procesos."
good,"A day at Honeywell, start at 8 and work till 3:30 and had 15-30 minute lunch no breaks."
good,"Learning is good, opportunity is more for engineers.  "
good,I worked for Honeywell for 34 years at which time I retired from that current role and took on the role of an HSE Manager. The benefit package that is offered is not a good package and someone would be better having their own then using the provided.
good,"Unfortunately, in a global company, some management decide that their staff need to cover all areas of the global at all hours of the day and night."
good,"No se tienen una direccion estrategica, dada a los cambios de la direccion tan frecuentes se tiene una inestabilidad en el campus."
good,Sales that I cannot control govern my merit.  I have no influence over the quotas I'm given nor the time it takes to meet them. Great pressure is put on us to meet these for the holy shareholders.  It's a shame we can't focus on doing a good job for our customers.
good,"I loved  to work here. You learn many new things.how process an"
good,"It is a good place to work at, I just love the outdoors and this job is an inside job! Management is good but needs to look at all employees and not just a chosen few."
good,Typical MNC. Nothing to write home about. Middle and upper middle management lacks vision and strategy. So it does not help even though senior management is great
good,"My colleagues were amazing to work with. The company itself does not appreciate those that actually do the groundwork that earns the income."
good,Honeywell is a very busy place.  Customers call inquiring on orders and wondering when they will ship.  Most customers needed their parts yesterday but we try to work within our means to provide them the best possible service.
good,Good compensation but questionable upper management decisions.  Not a lot of opportunity to move up within the organization.
good,"•	Interfacing with various departments to resolve problems with timely delivery, rejections, etc."
good,Honeywell is a great company for individuals who are looking for contract or short term work. The pay is good and the jobs available are specific. Plenty of overtime.
good,i am very honest for my work. I like Software testing. I written hard test cases.I am working on Honeywell products(Scanner) with different types of firmware.
good,The company is always keep putting pressure on the employees to be more productive and they always talk about the cost cutting that bothers each employee.
good,"Daily work includes reworking old pages on the various brand websites. Monitoring of the website statistics and feeding back to executives on the trends that are happening. Maintaining of the whole marketing automation process and responsible for looking after lead nurture and PPC. "
good,"Recently, a lot of management changes.  Some good, but many changes were not productive and were more harmful then helpful."
good,"En esta empresa existe un ambiente muy estresante, las exigencias y espectativas son altas en todos los niveles. El trabajo se hace siguiendo los lineamientos de manufactura esbelta y el Sistema Operativo Honeywell, dicho sistema fue hecho para estandarizar procesos y procedimientos en todas las empresas hermanas."
good,"A typical day at work is Customer communication and ensure data is accurate and update in diversity system.  I understand practice is a must; however, I would like to be thorough with statistics transformation.  I really don't care to comment on management and co- workers.  Since writing macros  is the hardest part of my job and they are need for efficient  data process  and my reporting.  I generally end a at day with ensure customer satisfaction and completeness is accomplished."
good,Honeywell looks ahead and supports established technologies with the highest quality.
good,Design engineers are tasked with many different projects at one time that all need to be completed. There is a lot of communication and cooperation within different groups of the design organization. We are required to be self motivating and to stay organized in order to complete all the required and assigned work.
good,"At this facility favoritism and nepotism is king. If you dont have a degree your a nobody. Most of the work is fair except plant 25, this is a dangerous slave shop. They dont spend money to make money so their is a lot of manual labor that should be automated."
good,"Honeywell bought out Callidus and changed the entire atmosphere. We went from a company of less than 100 to over 60,000 over night. As with most large companies, they focused on training and checking the box, instead of letting us do our jobs."
good,"Ambiente bom , trabalhos para promoção e confiança do cliente"
good,"Se ofrecía un buen salario y ambiente de trabajo, pero no había tantos beneficios como fondo de ahorro, no había antigüedad, ni bonos"
good,The company's work culture was kind of OK. The training was very hectic and no learning time was given for students from a non computer science background to understand and work work coding concepts.
good,"Not a bad company to work at, the rotating shift work gets old quick with only one weekend off a year.  Not a hard job at all with plenty t of overtime opportunities.  Benefits are ok, like everyone else with high deductables.  Vacations accumulate depending on how many years of service you have."
good,"I enjoyed what I did at Honeywell. I was not always happy with how I had to do it. A typical day was clouded with meetings. Many of those meetings gave conflicting direction as to how things would be accomplished. I can say that this level of turmoil made me better at problem solving, negotiation and communication. I enjoyed the comradery of my fellow peer engineers but not the tutelage of my senior managers."
good,"There were many corporate activities including 5s, HOS, Gemba. continuous improvement,  tier meetings, team building etc. Technicians worked with assemblers, management and engineers."
good,Contract position in a warehouse setting 8 hours a day with a flexible schedule and ample breaks. Work was slow paced and equipment not available to perform tasks sometimes.
good,"Job is very demanding. However, it is a rewarding career. There are a lot of processes and things get dragged on because of analysis paralysis and various trade studies that needs to complete before a task is officially undertaken."
good,"everyday is busy"
good,"Good place, but didn't want to hire anyone full time and my contracting agency didn't compensate me nearly well enough.  I was told upfront that it was fairly unlikely I'd be hired full time, and the lack of benefits was a major downside."
good,"Typically it's similar to Rockwell Collins that deals with Avionics Product.The hardest part of the job is also committing deadline"
good,"Honeywell is a very large world wide organization which is sometimes challenging to work with colleagues in other countries due to some issues with communication. There is constant change in Management as they are moved from region to region, and position to position. Job security and benefits are somewhat lacking and the attitudes of many employees reflects gap."
good,"answering phones, customer service, taking orders, daily to weekly reports and vendor classes filling us with knowledge of new products as well as rewarding us for our hard work and daily dedication."
good,"Se obtiene muchos beneficios y se aprende demasiado."
good,"If you cannot say something nice, say nothing at all.  Lots of really good people that help and also are there to make things better."
good,come to work at 7:30 am do our meeting then you start working on the job you are given  and we go home at 16:00 you work on different equipment
good,The days events were only set when the work day started and ended.  After that you were subject to the events that took place in the day.  Any work plans made could be altered and often would due to the dynamics of the job.
good,I enjoyed the working with the people that are there.  Despite the fact there was a lot work they made it fun and easy going no matter what happens.
good,"You get to pursue your interests but work pressure is equally taxing. The best part is the pay, pay is very good."
good,"1.    8 hour actively working"
good,Was a great place to work at until it was bought out by a bigger corporation and then relocated to Mexico. Some people who were older still to this day have not been able to find employment
good,"Fun work place with supportive management."
good,"Very busy"
good,"higher techs highly approachable. easier to  troubleshoot when callers are more knowlegable regarding system, techs able to point in different / correct direction to rectify problem"
good,"Swing shifts, Foul odor, great pay, quick advancement, processes are fairly easy to learn"
good,"Target driven"
good,They were downsizing when I started with them. A lot of my co-workers were moving to different positions with in the company.
good,"Good start of my career, exposure is good, culture is satisfactory, management team is encouraging"
good,"Temporary workers have to work a lot of mandatory overtime, and full time employees are not required to work any."
good,"Connaissance de la fonction RH sur site industriel."
good,I worked in this organisation more than 7 years.It is a great place to work.
good,Technical consultant - Did not engage in company's culture
good,"Working hours used to be 8 hours/day. Learned many things about automation and security systems such as CCTV systems, Access control, Fire Alarm System, Intrution System and Building Managment System. Management was good and co-workers were co-operative.Hardest part is doing complete day jobs and field service jobs in somedays. Enjoyed working with them."
good,"Good and lovely people around,"
good,I am still getting adjusted with how this company operates.
good,A typical day consists of takng calls from customers and engineers . Either logging jobs or dispatching them. Also if updates are required these ar performed. Checking E mails and actioning them asr required.
good,"The best thing about Honeywell during the downturn of 2008-2009 was that they didn't layoff very many people. We worked fewer hours, but they kept most of us on."
good,The hardest part of my job was knowing the job was going to be over and moved to Mexico. The people are respectful and encouraging. I loved working there.
good,"For high performers, Honeywell offers many growth opportunities across businesses. Change is inevitable so the best employees will be able to adapt easily."
good,I would not recommend working here longterm. Management does not want to see you move up they rather higher cheap labor to take your place when let you teach them and then lay you off
good,Bonne experience dans un groupe en constante evolution
good,Más oportunidades para entrar de planta a su empresa
good,very heavy metrics driven environment. decent amount of stress but it can be exciting if you're really into the purpose of what this company is about which is changing the world on a macro level. if you are into aeronautics and space type of environments and Artificial Intelligence then this is a place to be.
good,A career-type job if you select the right line of business to work in. I worked with a great team of guys that supported each other well. High tech-type knowledge is a must and it certainly helps to be a team player.
good,en general  una empresa  regular  con buenas  prestaciones laboralea
good,Good work place but it's run by polish they get preferences on everything plus they will fight you out of the job if u r progressing so their own can take positions available.
good,"Lots of work, good environment. Great place to work. Pretty good management. Take pretty good care of the work environment. Very good about the quality of the product they produce."
good,"Typical work day at for Honeywell in Afghanistan was 12 hours long, but you got to work hand and hand with the Marines. As a former Marine that was a little different to see things from a non uniformed side, but I felt like I was serving a purpose everyday."
good,"For being an on-call crew member the pay was decent. However, due to the nature of the on-call position getting hours was not easy. The work itself was generally labor intensive because everything was so fast-paced due to accommodating the show schedule and also the natural labors of being a stage crew member working traveling shows. I would say the most enjoyable parts of the job were the crew members (both traveling and local) and also just seeing everything come together at the end for showtime. The hardest parts of the job were getting hours and then working with people who weren't trained or were becoming to elderly for the demands of the job and picking up for their missteps."
good,My location performed energy efficiency testing and installed energy saving products. The workplace culture had a relaxed atmosphere. I spent the majority of my day reviewing the employee's job paperwork. I totaled the hours worked and compared it with the hours submitted for their payroll. There were times I helped the customers with their problems and concerns. That could be stressful at times. I learned a lot about energy efficiency while working there. My manager was very nice and understanding of the daily needs of his employees.
good,Great place to grow experience. Opportunity to work with fortune 500 companies. Expanded on various entities such as Technical Support and project management. Exposure to various products and cloud based applications
good,"I am responsible UK & Nordics Sales Business for Honeywell Building Solutions responsible for delivery of the Annual Quoted Order Plan of $80m USD in sales."
good,"Daily 10-15 mins meetings, fast-paced workplace and lots of overtime, If team success will get lunch or token to reveal for some other perks that they offer. Mostly morning shift might get into 2nd shift if prefer. Overall good place to get your experience and go somewhere else unless you know how to kiss a... You can volunteer for other types of activities such as quality, safety or 5S champion."
good,"Work life balance, benefits, equality and scope of growth is good. It provides equal opportunities to all its employees irrespective of gender, race, religion etc"
good,The day started out with contacting the customer setting up their appointments. Every customer was different every house we walked in was different. Management was sometimes mediocre at best. Workplace culture at times were cutthroat but for the most part we were cordial with each other. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customer's.
good,"The Job was easy but a lot of safety requirements. Management was not all that great in helping workers. Pay was not that great."
good,"Honeywell has offered many experiences, but has a high turnover rate for leadership.  I would like to see more attention focused on the local management team."
good,We often had to work overtime with no notice until we walked in the door. Often had to work Saturdays with only 1 day notice making it hard to plan anything on the weeks
good,"This was an exciting job....opportunity to develop a process from scratch. "
good,"A typical day at work  -  Many many meetings, planning, planning, and planning to ensure that there were enough parts staged and available at the right time for the B-52 Gyro builds. At the same time taking into accountability working with many people and different department all together to get to the end finished product."
good,"A large company that seems a bit disjointed, not very good at translating forward planning to workforce practically, always chasing orders at the end of each month."
good,I worked at this Company for 4 years. Good culture and conducive work environment.There are great people at all levels of the organisation. A lot of opportunities to learn.
good,Global MNC operating in over 100 Countries. Great work environment. People work as a good team. The company has a good policy of continued learning via online courses. Is a good place provided you are set in the right team in MEA region.
good,"Overall management was exceptional"
good,"Honeywell is geared at mass production of it product."
good,The  most enjoyable part of the helping others by improving or solving IT issues and leading productive projects.  But this can be difficult when working in such a large company with so many varying businesses.
good,"The team I worked with was great. The culture is a little dated and they don't offer temp to perm positions within the company. As a contractor, I went above and beyond when I started but was never offered to join the company. There was also alot of turn over there which made morale seem low too."
good,The typical day was ordering supplies and visited employees' offices to perform repairs. Performing daily task with minimal support was a challenge.  The contract ended and it was a challenge finding employment in the area.
good,It's been more than 10years working here now I don't see any scope of growth. Had been working hard and don't see any results in compensation and any other benefits. Sometimes you are forced to loose things on your own. Work life balance is not their anymore.
good,"Good place to grow in your field of expertise, good local team and good benefits. All of which have changed the last few years and are no where near where they used to be"
good,"No ""set time"" to come into work, come in at a reasonable time and put in your 8 hours.  A lot of opportunities to learn new things!"
good,"Empresa boa, dinamica. Depois que foram feitas algumas modicações na estrutura da empresa, alguns ótimos profissionais forão despedidos."
good,"hardest part is getting there because the hours are awfull its swing shift so you go from night to second to first shift you work 3/4 weekends a month, pay is decent"
good,"Aqui trabajamos tranquilos pero se nos deja ser es decir los operadores son ingobernables y RH no nos ayuda a mejorar la situacion."
good,Over all Honeywell is a good company to work for. It's unfortunate they are currently going thru a reduction in workforce and furloughs.
good,fast paced and constantly changing.......growing larger everyday and creating many new adventures.  Will continue to grow in the future
good,Plenty of room for advancement by applying for internal jobs. Salary jobs work mostly without supervision. Honeywell has an excellent training center to improve your skills.
good,"Comfort Partners, A great team was built, unfortunately the work is Grant Dependent, the money can run out in an instant.  Work is done in neighborhoods that need it the most, consequentially these neighborhoods are not the safest, nor are the working conditions the cleanest. A clear dedication to the work and helping the client is paramount or burn out and bad work product will be an issue.  Anyone hired to this job has to be a team player and have the ability to play a version of 3 dimensional chess i.e. answering questions on the phone while crawling through an attic or slogging through a basement while accurately capturing the information needed and teaching the client about how their house or apartment works and what they can do to save energy and keep warm or cool depending on the time of year."
good,"Not much job security, but thoroughly enjoyed working there for the short period of time as a contractor.  Would love to have worked there longer, but there was budget cuts and the contractors were let go."
good,"This company has a lot going for it but the biggest downfall is the way they treat career paths. In order for you to move up in a position, 1 of 3 things must happen. 1. the person holding the job title you seek gets fired. 2. the person holding the job title you seek quits or ""decides to seek other opportunities"". 3. the person holding the job title you seek retires!"
good,"Dia a dia com atendimento ao cliente, ligações e envios de cartas."
good,co-workers are good nice working environment. learned more about fire systems. i like the helping nature of my co-worker.
good,"Answering calls creating backlog, and confirmation reports. Training new hires on all aspects of prgram also. I enjoyed the work enviroment very busy and cowaokers were always smiling and cheerful"
good,Honeywell is a good place to work if your permanent but most of the time you have to start as a temp and sometimes you dont get hired and it takes 6 months to go back but its worth it if you like working with your hands and building engines.
good,"Work in a very dynamic and fast pace MNC."
good,"I enjoy the work and like the people I work with.  "
good,Strong focus on safety and no lost time incidents. Good contractor to work for.
good,Big company with the global workspace. Flexible work hours.
good,"good work opportunities"
good,Love working here but benefits are terrible for whats required. No medical no dental no vacation and no holiday since I am a contractor. The possibility of moving up in the company is almost non-existent. I am qualified for a better paying more challenging position and yet I am stuck in my current position. Too many talented people are let go and replaced by worthless workers because they don't like to hire contractors to full time associates.
good,"era llegar saludarnos , y a tomar cada quien su despeje para empezar a trabajar eramos parejas, aprendi todo muy rapido la con  la dirrecion y gerencia casi no hubo contacto, mis compañeras eran unas personas muy accesibles, lo mas dificil de trabajo a mi no me toco, pero era darle salida al producto, y lo que mas me gusto fue que todo lo que haciamos era facil y si no podia hacer las cosas todas estaban disponibles para ayudar ."

Handle all Suppliers with < than $100k spend port-folio"
good,"Had been with Magna for about one year. Found managerial staff and officers caring and responsible. Helpful to its employees. Lot many things to learn and grow. However, job security is the main issue. It can be enhanced by helping their employees to get re-employment."
good,"The hours are long and the the working conditions can be brutal but the pay is good and the local workers are very friendly."
good,"Used SAP to create production orders for products to ship. Processed returns, receiving them into inventory. System and manual count of inventory. Ordered supplies from UPS and Fed-EX. Ensured proper placement of supplies within warehouse."
good,Working at a customer facility and with the customer program team was an effective and positive environment. Morning group meetings identifying projects and potential additional work activity was successful. Softball team included customer and contracted personnel. The toughest part was knowing their was an acquisition coming and having to releive personnel from their jobs.
good,"Served as engineering manager and technical leader to multidisciplinary R&D teams of engineers designing, implementing, testing, and validating GPS augmentation and landing systems for commercial aviation."
good,"shipping, receiving, warehouse order picking and packing. trailor loading with electronic or manual pallet jacks. working with box packing taping machine and maintenance of equipment. occasitonal training and supervision."
good,"Enjoy working with customers and resolving their problems, learning new solutions every day, progressing in manegerial duties, sharing knowlege with and training younger workers. The hardest part of a job would be becoming familiar with a new piece of equipment. The most enjoyable part of a job would be having a satisfied customer after their crisis."
good,I get to work on commercial aircraft air flow assemblies. Piping is in place to simulate the aircraft and flow air to Fan assemblies.

good,"First, let me just say that I do like my job. I've got a good boss (When he can make it out to see me), and the people I work with are some of the best folks you will ever meet. "
good,The current leadership is good to work with. The location is good. Commute is not long. Facility is striving to upgrade equipment. Most of the employees have been working for the company for many years. They are very helpful and want the company to do well. Overall it is a good company to work with and for.
good,"Motivational team Leader, facility management ad a whole to the company standard. Job success is a good experience for the future. Better  challenging potential prospects."

good,There was a reorganization every quarter at Honeywell. There was no clear career path identified. They change the sales bonus structure for the worst.
good,"The atmosphere of honeywell is so competitive, healthy  and friendly environment.  As a personally i will confidently assure the organisation is good for who are really looking for develop their personal growth is good to furtherly"
good,Easy work and great co-workers. Team meetings every morning. Quarterly and annual updates on business. Shift work and plenty of overtime to sign up for.

good,"I love the culture at Honeywell. I have enough time at home to spend with family, I don't take work home with me, I get opportunities to learn and grow in the company. However, I worry that I will have limited advancement opportunity within the company and may need to look elsewhere to further my career. I also see Honeywell tends to try to please shareholders by buying back stock, increasing their dividend, etc, when they could be raising salaries, making our healthcare more affordable, or including more employees in the bonus pool."

good,"I received nothing but good report about my performance but it never add up to my pay or experience or continuous improvements. We were reward with pizza not money. If you trained new people and this was a expected y there was never a promotion and incentive. The people I worked with were awesome, great team work. But the company rarely acknowledged that."
good,"A corporation that is built around its stock holders, employees are treated fare but expected to lead the charge and be self driven / motivated, the days are always busy."
good,They paid for my masters degree.  There were lots of opportunities for advancement and to take on more responsibilities.  Managers were fair for the most part.

good,bad company for internal improvement they do not appreciate the worker and prefer to buy in new people for higher wages than pay internal personnel on job changes the proper equivalent. other than this a good company to work for
good,Not a great for career advancement. Lack of understanding what they need in industry. One can say it is not an employee friendly organization rather it is their stock driven organization.
good,"Productive and fun workplace with all infrastructure and cool work atmosphere."
good,"It was a limited temporary position, Fine for what it was. I have nothing further to add. I would gladly add more if there was more to talk about. I answered phones and set up technical responses when needed."
good,Learned a lot of new aspects regarding Honeywell products and their vendors and how these products are used and calibrated. Enjoyed my coworkers and schedule.
good,"Serviced Clients in City and surrounding area"
good,Good benefits and good pay . Management is could be better and under going over a year long security background check is stressful especially when you cant do your required job without it.

good,"Honeywell taught me to be an excellent professional, very capable.  They are fast paced and can be a challenging company to work for however, they pride themselves on great talent and will push you to the limit to do and be your best.  I was promoted multiple times and allowed to develop and recruit talent as well as promote/elevate my team. "
good,"fun and vibrant work environment, good people to work with."
good,I found the working environment at Honeywell to be stressful but yet rewarding.  It is impossible for one person to have a completed understanding of the work environment at Honeywell since it is such a large corporation with many independent divisions.

good,productive not a bad company to work for would help if pay was better for long term employee overall  the the job was not bad and the team members are great.
good,I was managed with unskilled eyes.  I was pushed very hard to make unreasonable deadlines.  Management did not understand the complexity of the work I performed.  I never worked fast enough for them.
good,good place to work for with good management team....deferential work ethic and multicultural atmosphere where you can find employees from deferential backgrounds.
good,"Very productive, but work long hours and weekends. The associates are very knowledgeable and will help when project help is needed. Sometimes work will be placed on top instead of holding accountable of person's actual work."
good,"Top leaders has great vision."
good,Job consist of working at various client's facilities so there is certain amount of freshness to each day.  The pay is fair and the benefits are  good except for the health insurance which is abysmal.
good,Good team environment with many opportunities for professional growth. High standards are expected but assistance is provided if needed. A top quality company.
good,Honeywell provides great career advancement opportunity for people who are willing to work hard and ambitious.  A lot of new initiatives every month and everything has to move at lightning speed in order to meet Wall Street expectation.  Sometimes the aggressiveness makes decision making based on short-term gain instead of long term sustainability.  Many times the greed of management could lead decision to walk on grey fine lines.   Is not a place for ordinary people who wants to have 9-5 jobs or work life balance.  They reward well those who are high performers and have no mercy to those who are no longer needed.
good,This company is a good place for anyone looking for a challenging position with talented management. Honeywell Aerospace in Greer is ahead of their time with lean basics.
good,Very busy place to work due to very lean teams supporting a heavy workload.  There is a lot of opportunity to learn and spend time in areas of interest to grow your skills to support career interests.  There is a lot of turnover and culture is very investor and customer focused.

good,"En general está muy bien, pero no te da un proyecto tal cual para escalar dentro de la empresa o poder desarrollarte en otras áreas. "
good,"Fast paced and very dynamic organization.  Generally high demands are placed upon individuals and teams.  If you are seeking a peace and quiet role, Honeywell is not for you."
good,Solid company with good benefits and growth. Strong market presence. The people are great. The products are cool. Opportunities for advancement. Strong work ethic among employees
good,Overall it's a good company to work for. People are friendly. Open work space. Unlimited time off. Career advancement opportunities. Benefits could be better.
good,"Good place to work for and learn & discover, apply , test and develop better capabilities in work areas."
good,A day to day at Honeywell can vary week by week.  There could be a project to build for a customer at the office.  You might be going to a site to fix something high priority.  Or you may be going to another customer site as routine preventive maintenance.
good,"I worked at Honeywell for twenty four years and learned a lot along the way. I believe hardest part of the job was seeing everyone be laid off and having work loads double, sometimes triple. The best thing was meeting some amazing people that have become lifelong friends being in a family style work environment."
good,"Honeywell, a manufacturing company gave me ample scope to understand and expertise in the budgeting and financial analysis sector. It also helped me to develop my professional abilities."
good,Have traveled the world with this company. Many changes since the oil and gas downturn. Some of these changes have been unpleasant. Immediate management is good. Middle management and above will take from the employees to make their bottom line.
good,"houve uma grande mudança interna o que ocasionou uma queda na qualidade de trabalho interno, mas continua uma otima empresa para se trabalhar."
good,"Empresa con limitado potencial de crecimiento, pero con muy buenas prestaciones y alto sentido de capacitacion"
good,"I've been @ Honeywell for over 28 years, but now the future of the Aerospace market for Honeywell is unclear.  Compensation and benefits has always been the selling point for Honeywell and up until 4 years ago, I would agree.  Now, with the uncertainty of the market and benefits declining, associates are now leaving, pursuing other opportunities locally and afar.  It was once a great place to work, but it's now time to move on."
good,"This was an eight hour a day, Monday through Friday, position with possible overtime hours. The co-workers were like family as this was a well established company. It's too bad that it is now closed."
good,"Honeywell was a great place to work at, the pay was okay also. They were very great about safety tips and make sure people were safe on bad weather days."
good,It has been over 20 years since I worked at Honeywell and cannot give it a fair/accurate review that would be useful today.  Being forced by website to put something in here
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job were my fellow co-workers. I was under a microscope for most of the shift, but it kept my attention because I am a very analytical person."
good,"The work place is good , to learn different different types of  fire  system connection , to ability hole side managed, the work side is international airport such as a big side in this fild."
good,"Honeywell is a good company. But I was working as a service engineer on ITC ltd ranjangaon,  Pune. In fire system  access control system, CCTV , and PA system"
good,Nothing really stood out to me while interning here over one summer. The site I was working at didn't seem to be taking its acquisition by Honeywell to well.
good,The first five years was great. We had more work and lots of activities throughout the year that made work enjoyable. The last five years had not been so good.  Took away all the fun activities we use to have. In order to get a raise you have to bid on a higher level job that they move down a level when they post it. So basically its a lateral move. They also have a pay range for each position that they do not go by. Benefits is ok just like any other company. Job security is ok as well. Not a hard place to work.
good,"A company where we can see many domains and lot many opportunities for freshers as well as new joinees."
good,"Great room for growth. "
good,The people in the high demand leadership positions are good communicators.  They respect their employees and are considerate of their work and personal life needs.

good,"Honeywell is the place to build our skills and enhance skills, lot of training is provided to the required person. work culture and respect among eachother is good."
good,"My typical day was spent preparing customer invoices, checking customer accounts for credit limits and past due balances.  At month end I was responsible for booking AR and cash flow journal entries and reconciliations.  I worked closely with customer service, our customers, and other Honeywell associates both in the USA and globally.  I had a great manager and mentor.  He taught me other finance functions other than AR & cash flow and kept me informed of company policies, changes, etc.   Our department was small, but we were a very functional department.  I enjoyed the cash collection process and making sure that our accounts were not past due.  The hardest part was leaving after 22 years.  Our department was laid off December 2013 when our site converted to SAP."
good,The company has undergone many internal changes in the 3.5 years that I have been here.Nowadays it is mainly all work and no play and the work from home policy was recently taken away.I would say the work experience was much better earlier on and had steadily dwindled
good,"Honeywell DSES in Albuquerque, NM is a nice facility.  As a temporary employee, I was treated fairly and included in the day to day activities in and out of work."
good,A small development group focused on the development and introduction of cutting edge home patient monitoring device solutions and clinical monitoring services.
good,"Honeywell is a challenging company that emphasizes developing employees and promotes organic growth. I've learned the philosophies behind project management and the importance of collaborating with all departments within an organization in an open and tolerant manner.

good,"Productive and fun at workplace. "
good,"I strive to make what we are doing better.  This includes actively seeking better ways to develop, test, integrate or field our product.  I have developed products extensively in C and Java and a little in C++/C#.  My forte is to figure ways to break the product and or processes (Testing) , then offer constructive ways to fix them."
good,"very difficult when any visit occur"
good,I found the job challenging enough.  I was disappointed in the ability to move up or around at times due to constraints on certain job needs.  Had to adjust to a culture of the squeakiest wheel gets the attention.  I was not used to that; I was used to just doing my job and not announcing it to the world.
good,"good company"
good,"Good benefits, bad management a lot process to complete normal activities, nice people to develop work activities."
good,Very detailed oriented workplace. Working environment was very positive and productive. Management team was very supportive in achieving company's success.
good,"I was only an intern and most of my work was top secret, but I got to be involved in some really awesome things. The people here are very nice and want to see you succeed."
good,"Tolles operating system (DMEAC) Six Sigma, gute visualisierung der Operatieven Prozesse"
good,OK.  No issues... all good.   Great place to work on all shifts. It's a union house so... Don't know what to say other than this survey is getting on my nerves INDEED.

good,"the workplace is involved and technical, the co-workers get along relatively well. i would say the the hardest part of the job would be navigating the procedure and its many associated texts."
good,Honeywell is a global company. It has many divisions to work for. These divisions are synergistic. Most production is offshore. Must sustain global force.
good,"Honeywell is a good Company to work for , however with the Aerospace industry in a decline job security is scarce and in question."
good,"Company provides very good support for improving my procurement career. Learn a lot such as Six Sigma accreditation."
good,"I enjoyed working at Honeywell.  My patients complaints ranged from seasonal allergy/cold to more severe stroke, DM, or heart problems.  The facility provided adequate support for patient care."

good,"Its very use full website for everyone, really who is looking for a better growth in their career."
good,"I enjoyed working for Honeywell. I worked as a machinist in their research and development lab. My previous experience consisted mainly of production.

good,"Honeywell offers good advancement opportunities for those who understand, support and work proactively towards change management and continuous improvement.  Their plant at Minneapolis is an excellent example of applying the Toyota Way to improve company bottom line.  In addition to the leadership opportunities, providing  technical on the job coaching for incoming, new hires, about the day to day 'details' will help ease transfer of knowledge between long standing employees and new hires.

The world’s corporate/business environment is changing and Honeywell is not immune. It is currently going through a lot of its own changes."
good,Large Company. A lot of different areas to work and a lot of opportunities to grow and develop in your career. It is easy to be lost in the large company but the ability to grow is there.
good,"Much of the same from Honeywell in that Honeywell was sold to Atmel Corp. Another excellent company to work for in that the company was very professional and organized with very good training. Manufactured semiconductors in the clean-room and work was busy and challenging. Cleaning some of the machines was very hot and demanding but again not overwhelming."

good,"Honeywell Integrated Supply Chain  had a fair amount of issues but is / was no different than any other large corporation."
good,"Maxon Corporation is dedicated to serving the combustion industry with industrial burners and valves.  In a typical day as an administrative assistant consisted of providing support to the sales director, and the inside and outside sales team. Duties included making flight & hotel arrangements, ordering company cars,  preparing agreements, and maintaining monthly sales reports. The employees were supportive and focused on a team approach to exceeding customer needs.  The hardest part of my job was prioritizing and accomplishing requests from the sales director and 9 sales offices. The most enjoyable aspect of my job was planning and coordinating annual sales meetings."
good,Working as a government contractor for NASA was interesting and stressful. Every 5 to 10 years the contractors had to compete all over again for the contract. This caused extreme friction with the employees and wore me down. When my kids left home for colege I changed jobs and eventually moved to the west coast for a position at Ampex.
good,Great leadership and management.  Overworked to the max but still tried to make time for employees.  Technical procedures were a little vague and there wasn't enough manpower to properly run the program but overall it was a great job.
good,Company is good in it's segment. Good people. Generally work life balance is good. Good Opportunity. Processes are overburden.
good,"Ever since i have started working for Honeywell, my experience and capability increased alot. Main role was to deliver material to production line. Never the less I have received training for every other possible duty there. Goods in ( book in ), picking, packing, put aways, aswell as goods out. I also was one of the few people who gladly stayed  for overtimes if and when needed. On top of that the staff i had pleasure to work with was as professional as amusing and fun to deal with."
good,I only worked for this company for a few months but from what I gathered the people were really nice and the warehouse was incredibly clean.

good,"Highly Professional Technology System"
good,"Honeywell has a very good atmosphere.  Everyone works well together and cares about getting the job done.  However, it is very difficult to move up in the company.  The managers are more keen on hiring managers and engineers from outside then promoting from within."
good,"Very mature company and functional excellence.  You can learn a great amount from the people at Honeywell.  The base pay is usually pretty good competitively at the outset however meager annual increases result in eventual below market pay for employees that stick with the company for 3-5 years or more.  The business is at the point where there is functionalization overreach.  Best practices stifle productive and creative thought.  Most people are only interested in meeting their own metrics which in many cases are removed from business sense.  The most recent example is 'de-banding' where previous managerial positions are being 'de-banded' to a lower level of employment (ie lower pay, because you're not a 'manager' despite doing exactly the same or more scope of work)."
good,"Pros:"
good,"I would would here again.  The work requires clearance, so there is nothing I can tell you, except I program CMM's in Calypso, both online and on the cmm."
good,"Some exciting times for the first 4 years there. Engineering teams were engaged with continuous improvement, Manufacturing with Self Directed Work Teams, and new products were being created which kept everyone excited. Then, it was time to be sold, and the new owner did not value structured continuous improvement as much as maintaining their ISO 9000 status."
good,"Supply proper materials to system as and when required"
good,"Productive and fun when worked in complex projects. As a professional, you can learn what you want. Freedom to learn. "
good,"great place with open mindset people, encouraging continuous improvement and growth, good environment and intercultural exchanges, continuous learning, good dynamics"
good,"Assisting the army with property book issues "
good,Big company culture. Too slow to react to changes in products and marketing by competitors resulting in licensing of name to one of the competitors.

I make every attempt to complete these. However, priority B items can be somewhat negotiated if not completed. Priority C items are those maintenance things that should be done but won't affect operations much if not necessarily done that day. Sometimes priority C items take care of themselves.

I was able to choose the hours that best fit my schedule as long as the work was completed. I would load and install software for computers as well as work with other employees to troubleshoot the issues they were having with their computers.

good,"A typical day at work consisted of a couple daily meetings. Routine work related to global planning along with troubleshooting problems related to supply and demand.

good,"P&L focused"
good,"Demasiado stress, constantes cambios administrativos"
good,"Unbelievable place to work from the free snacks and lunch with the ability to utilize any technology from react to c#. "
good,My department manager was promoted from a CSR to Export Customer service manager.  He was on a power trip and picked on his team members.  Not a very well verse when it comes to work ethics and responsibilities.
good,This is a difficult place to work because there's always layoff talk.If you are not secure in knowing you have a job next month then it makes life decisions much harder.
good,"Good culture with strong management and opportunity for growth, that could be limited depending on the function of the job. Very technical company so having engineering background will help a lot."
good,Non-existant. Work and getting the product out the door is more important than employee's time off time. Many 12 hour days. Employees left or removed and not replaced. Others leaned on to pick up the slack at the expense of their own jobs.
good,The engineering gets blamed for everything and the floor workers get away with everything. The responsibility all falls on one group and needs to  change. That being said. advancement and flexibility is possible here.
good,"Honeywell is overall a good place to work but with some high demands of employees. Junior level positions still need to plan on 50+hrs per week with more time required the higher one advances. Director level position need to plan on 70+ hrs per week. You can and will get calls after work/on weekends. However, do not immediately let this scare you off. There are some really good teams to work with. Some of the best friends I've made both personally and professionally I have made at Honeywell. While the expectations are high, the camaraderie in ""finding a way"" is excellent! The benefits are competitive. Note that as in any large company, your work day depends greatly upon who is in your management chain. Both some very good bosses and some not so good ones exist there."

good,"Honeywell is a good company filled with great people, great environment surrounded with motivational people that want you to do your best, opportunities for growth aren't always available but they do come up every so often."
good,"A typical day at work was 12hrs a day, 7 days a week. I worked overseas under a government contract. I loved the work but was burnt out after the first year and decided to come back to the states. Management had its ups and downs, there were some issues but it was fair and professional. The hardest part of the job was the location, it was in the middle east and being close to a war zone was tough.The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to serve the troops and make their transition in and out theater smoothly as it can be."
good,"Good on-site management with support and training."
good,"Since our group supports customers throughout the Midwest, travel to customer sites is often required.  Working remotely from home for controls programming, HMI configuration and teleconferencing is allowed."
good,"I worked there for 5 years. Was making good money while I was there. Overtime every other week normally. There was a family environment do to a small amount of employees working at the plant that I worked at. Ppe was provided, lots of physical work and you worked in the heat alot"

good,"At the time of this review, the Honeywell plants that I've worked at have been spun off and are now AdvanSix plants. The day to day grind will keep you busy and will stretch your multitasking skills while exposing you to much more than just Chemical and Mechanical engineering."
good,"no hay ""sangre nueva"" la dirección no es adecuada a los tiempos que corren, no al cambio digital"
good,"there is nothing more left to say. The evaluation speaks for itself. Why you think you need more, I don't quite understand. So I will type this to fulfill your requirement."
good,"The Redmond facility emphasized teamwork, a carry over from the Sundstrand days decades ago. The new Honeywell culture could not kill this, its too strong. Still a good place to work."

good,"Being a non-engineer or scientist in a company chock-full of them meant you had to earn your stripes if you were in a different role."
good,"Great pay, although high stress and unstable operations. If you apply your best you will move up through the company. Transfer from site to site is not necessarily easy."

good,"Nothing to complain about the work environment. Moderately interesting work, with a few very interesting projects. As always the case in Bangalore, they take no interest in matching people to work profiles. Any team will take you on as long as you have some software skills - they seems to be agnostic towards any real engineering or technological skills."
good,Typical place to work. Good workplace and fair management. Customer contract job. Night shift worst part. Enjoyed the people there. Typical day was PM's and work orders.

good,"Honeywell is a great place to get your wheel and brake aircraft mechanics experience. Great place to work, very stable and they have great communication skills."
good,"Good place to work, new products to work on every few years. They strive to pay within the average pay range. They are transferring as much engineering capability to Eastern Europe, India and China as allowed by US technology restrictions."
good,Micro Management at it's finest. Not much room for advancement. Merit pay increases are very low. You are very lucky if you can receive 1.5 - 2.0%  a year. Some years they give absolutely nothing.
good,"Overall nice place to work. The company has struggled over the past few years due to the downturn in military spending.  fortunately, it is starting to make a comeback now."

good,Honeywell provides good careers for many people.  I had many wonderful opportunities and experiences there.  I was able to hone both technical knowledge and management skills.
good,"Supporting client with their technical quires, learned Six Sigma, presentation skills, MNC culture. Management is good but very much person specific. Workplace culture depends upon your manger. Maintain the MIS sheet is the hardest part. Activities which involves employees"
good,"Great company to work for, most departments provide great work/life balance. The ones that dont are drowning in more work than they have people/resources. The people that are there end up burning out from being overworked. Pay is reasonable if coming in from a different company. Starting from an entry level there though, pay raises are tough and subpar (especially considering the poor benefits)"
good,"- Good work life balance."
good,Good overall company to work for. The aerospace industry can be very stressful but also rewarding. Also most aerospace companies are in a volatile time in the industry. Be prepared to live and breathe Honeywell Aerospace or you will not be successful. Great job for new college grads or single employees.
good,Great people to work with. everyone is very helpful and willing to teach. offers overtime to those who wants it. Best part about the job is how everyone works together.

good,"the job was great but sometimes you just felt like another name on a checklist, I would work for the company again if the chance arose."
good,I am contract but trying to get permanent is impossible.  Its fast pace and I learn something everyday.  The culture is good.  the hardest part is being in production but its the most exciting.  I love what I do and I do a great job.  People recognize that here but its unfortunate that I wont be made permanent because there just isn't a budget to support me.
good,"I worked there for 11 years in several departments , customer service ,shipping receiving quality and help out where I could, learned a lot the the plant closed and moved to mexico"
good,People that work here are usually good but leadership frequently changes over causing a lack of consistency in strategy and focus
good,Honeywell service team is a great team to work for but like any team it is only as good as its management and if that changes the whole team dynamic can change......
good,"Leuke firma, echter met 140.000 werknemers vaak te onpersoonlijk."

good,"This is typical corporate job where you are just a number and everybody is replaceable."
good,"I learned how to calibrate, modify and repair thermal chambers and vibration equipment. I interfaced with several different groups to schedule planned maintenance of their equipment and worked closely with the maintenance department. "
good,It is a very fast paced manufacturing environment in Defense and you must be able to juggle several priorities.  Management in recent years is not as experienced as they used to be.  There is a lot of good people who have worked there a long time that makes the work easier.
good,The people at Honeywell are wonderful to work with. Proposal writing in this specific group was challenging due to understaffing.

good,"As a Production Coordinator at Honeywell I was able to be hands on with the product I was responsible for, not only coordinating schedules but  actually moving product to different departments, discussing priorities with department leads. I enjoy interacting with people and this position allowed me that opportunity. My position consisted of many different duties which utilized my exceptional organization skills and ability to multi-task which was also important to me. I was responsible for creating and maintaining reports, attending meetings, reviewing documentation, consulting with engineers on quality issues,  production improvements and much more."
good,"Coworkers are great and the heart of my desire to work. It is a huge campus and company so it naturally has a political atmosphere and sometimes too much effort is spent to complete a simple task. In a nutshell, there wasn't ever a day where I woke up regretting that I had to go to work."
good,"Fue una experiencia muy buena, comencé trabajando cuando no era una industria muy conocida (Musitani) y con el tiempo creció y se transformo en una de la mas conocidas e importantes en el rubro. Con el tiempo la compro una multinacional (Honeywell) la cual creció mucho mas, haciéndose mucho mas productiva."

good,"Fast paced"
good,"I came in on contract to fill for the Buyer as he was recovering from surgery for only 2-3 weeks.

good,"In a typical day I would start early, catch up on any overnight emails and activity, read the reactive and security reports."
good,"Work is easy and the management is helpful. Advancement is pretty decent. Coworkers were mostly knowledgeable on jobs, and easy to train. The hardest part of the job were the hours, and the best part was knowing you were helping people."
good,"A great experience with great people, and I was able to interact with several Syracuse University and SUNY ESF faculty members.

good,Great employee relationship. Management will be management the company doesn't care about it's employees. Learning new an different jobs was well. There wasn't anything hard about working for this company. The most enjoyable part about the job is the employees working together as a team.
good,You get to work with other military personnel with like experiences and the same mindset. Training received in the military prepared me for the work associated with this contract.
good,I left this company becaus ethey really didn;t have any flexability at the time. no room for advancement either in the area I was in.

good,"Honeywell wasn't a bad place to work. It was indeed a big corporation though. It was not personal. Honeywell was not a bad place at all to work. I can't speak about all management by my manager (the manager of production in Richmond on Dabney Rd) was a great person. He made sure you got your work done but he also genuinely cared about his employees. He was a great guy to work for and because of how much he cared about his employees, he made them want to work that much harder."
good,"The environment in the head office is relatively laid back, a culture of appropriate work/life balance is available. The campus buildings are a little dated. Pay is on the lower end of the scale for the industry but options in the Chicago area are limited. Cost of company health insurance has been rising while benefits have been decreasing."
good,"Honeywell Security Group is a nice place to work. I have learned a lot over the years with time management, bringing customers up to speed on new products and initiatives.

good,My day starts at 6:00 pm and ends at 6:00 am. I am a machine operator producing personal protective equipment. My management is easy to get along with and do not micro-manage us. Co-workers are a blast to work with. Not the ideal job for everybody but it pays decent and has good benefits.
good,"This position allowed me to gain additional knowledge of supply chain.  I have never worked in an actual production plant, so saw first hand how complex a production plant is.  Have a much better appreciation of how a stoppage in production at any level of a build negatively impacts the ability to move product out the door."

good,Overall not a bad place to work. Will be better once all open positions are filled. Benefits are lacking.
good,Upper management wasn't good job was very easy employees were great
good,Working hard to be able to meet schedules to airlines. Everyone is dedicated to doing a good job they understand the importance of this business and major companies need their product ASAP.

good,"I am happy for the work profile, I would like to have similar profiles in any company."
good,Great learning experience.  Trouble shoot laptops and workstations as well as resolve hardware issues with servers.  Open and close Job tickets

I learn to be more attentive in making sure that the paper work and the product is completed correctly are good before it gets to the customer.Management are focus in to making sure that the customer are satisfied. Co-workers are transparent and the hardest part is to stay on top of everything and the best part is when we accomplish our goal in each month.

good,Unlimited resources and on the leading edge of technology in their particular product categories.
good,"The kind of work I did there was what I like to do and have done. They were 8 to 10 hour shifts with plenty of overtime. Each production cell had different cultures, some were friendly and supportive, and fun. While others would make you feel alienated not really help, train or support. The hardest part of the job was being a temp to hire."
good,"Com certeza diante das diversas ferramentas utilizadas,no dia dia dentro do processo de produção torna se uma grande escola com exemplos práticos."
good,"This would have been an awesome contract had it lasted the 9 months I was told it would. To add to that the dept I ended up in decided to outsource the work to an Indian company which meant over 100 regular employees were going to lose their jobs. Not a very happy environment to work in. All in all it was what it was. The money was great, but the length of the contract left something to be desired. I wanted to be their longer and in a department where people weren't disgruntled about losing their jobs. It was a sad assignment, but I made it through and a few weeks later I'm looking for another contract within Honeywell that hopefully will last a whole lot longer than this one did"
good,Honeywell Aerospace is an excellent place to work.  The people I work with are very professional.  I enjoy being tasked with creating new setups and fixturing.

good,Typical day for me was to check emails and pending issues that may have arrived towards the end of my shift or while I was off. Giving status on material received in inventory as well as troubleshooting all problems and issues that may arrive on the warehouse floor. The most enjoyable part of my job was to be able to help solve multiple issues in a timely matter.Educate and teach employees how to be more efficient in their daily duties through proper training. I learned a great deal of professionalism as a Honeywell employee.
good,Very fast paced environment. Getting invoices into the system so contractors may be paid on time. Co-Workers enjoyable to work with. Hardest part of job is ordering appliances that ALL customers are happy with. Try for 100% satisfaction.

good,Management was good and allowed me to work as an intern for short period
good,Most of the electronic tech work I did took 10-20 minutes plus 10 minutes of paperwork and stamps approved by the FAA. per module to be tested and repaired if it did not pass. It was a bit repetitive after even 3 months but the money was fair and I had a 1 hour drive.
good,"Its good company to work with, good work culture and values, employee centric."
good,Not a bad place to work but the management needs to spend more time concentrating on customers needs and not numbers put together by Six Sigma Black Belts. Numbers and needs don't always agree. Where I come from the Customer always comes first.
good,Challenging and learning working environment that encourages you to be a better employee. Company offers competative wages and even better benefits.
good,Continued to learn controls side of engineering. Worked with great group of people. Work was consistent

I have learned a great deal from the past eight years of my employment at Honeywell. Management is fair and for the most part, they will answer or help me with most of my problems. I work with some really good people that are friendly. The hardest part of my job is that a lot of the instructions for our work orders may require us to do certain things for our parts that I may not know how to do or is written to where I do not understand what is being called out for me to do. The most enjoyable part of my job is my relationship with my co-workers."
good,I started my career in computers at this company testing circuit boards and soon ended up in advanced manufacturing and then Hardware Quality Assurance. I stayed a little over 16 years. I would probably still be there if they hadn't decided to effectively get out of computers. I still keep in touch with people I worked with there.
good,"I would get to work and have a vehicle assigned to me. I would install the electrical euipment needed. My co workers were the best, always willing to help and show me new tricks. the hardest part of the job would have been locating the vehicles to service."
good,"Great environment for applying technical and management skills. Lots of pressure to meet schedule, however they typically let you do your job. Environment is often stressful due to expectation for everyone to respond to unplanned emergencies leading to lots of unplanned overtime. The stressful environment exists for managers and line personnel alike due to unplanned tasks requiring additional effort and time to gather, analyze and validate information. Global teams are usually responsive to unplanned requests due to time differentials."
good,Metric-driven organization with high standard for success.
good,"Operating forklift, moving pallets and materials to and from storage locations inside and outside of the warehouse. I enjoy Inventory management but wasn't thrilled when entire plant went to shiftwork."
good,"Facilities/cubes are old so do not expect a cutting edge office.  But with cube/office structure, it lends for senior leadership to be integrated into more meetings.  Helping to resolve issues quicker"

good,The company is great for up and coming young engineers. Honeywell is showing more diversity in upper management along with promoting more woman into VP and Director levels
good,"Its a place with a lot of Overtime Capabilities. Their isn't really anything difficult about the job. Supervisors are always nice, Its where i learned a lot of the new skills i will be taking to other jobs. The most thing I enjoy about the Job is the amount of shift opportunities they have."

good,"Lot of learning opportunities"
good,"I learned alot the people were very helpfu"
good,"Buen lugar de trabajo, falta un poco de equilibro de vida personal vs laboral"
good,I have not worked at Honeywell for nearly 5 years. It would not be fair if I rated them today as I know there have been many changes in management since I have left and I do not know what the culture is like today.
good,I didn't like working 12 hours shifts and 4 days work and 3 days off.                                 I learned a lot there about HVAC Controls. I never saw my managers because i worked a 6pm to 6am shift
good,Honeywell büyük bir şirket bundan dolayı yönetim matrisi de karışık. Bir anlamda iyi bir şey ama yükselme olanakları net değil
good,Good place to work and learn but the environment is not very good. You will have to be very alert so that you know what is happening around you. Very dynamic environment.
good,Dans l’ensemble cela a été une expérience très enrichissante sur le plan social et ma aide à avoir beaucoup d’entregent et avoir une capacité de prendre des decisSeul et éclairer
good,The engineers were great to work with    I loved doing whatever I could to make their life easier  and they were so appreciative   Best job I ever had
good,Allow to work autonomously to achieve agreed objectives. Working in a complex and diverse environment encourages creativity and team spirits. Need to be patience to adapt to its unique culture and be accepted.
good,"много бюрократии, очень тяжело развиваться внутри компании"
good,Corporate was too far removed from the issues and looking for short term gains rather than longevity.  Several Furloughs followed by eventual plant shut down.  Local management was good but needed to hold the team more accountable.
good,"Clean plant with lots of overtime opportunities. On Call frequently. Good benefits and advancement opportunities."
good,I work from home and the work is feast or famine. Sometimes it is really busy and some times there is nothing to do. Peers are accomplished and professional. Need more sales people to drive business.
good,"My work for HW took me away from the office and into the field for most of the time, but the time spent in the office was always nice and educational, during the monthly training scheduled for my type of work."
good,"High stress fast pace high performing teams, lots of learning opportunity and great visibility. Great pay for hard working high performing team members. Rapid promotions for educated employees willing to work hard and perform above expectations. Time off as needed without much question as long as your assignments are completed on time and budget.

good,"During busy months the work can be overwhelming, but they do promote quickly if you are a hard worker and keep accurate paper work. The staff and management does a good job with what they have to work with."
good,"Just use your common sense and you won't get injured, You'd go in see how much the team should be making of a product then go make said product, Pay attention to were things are at and you'll be out in an easy 8-10 hours"
good,"The people work together very well.  People from all walks of life.  There are opportunities to learn new things.  Fast pace environment.  Need more team building and appreciation events, and feedback on what is going well, and what could be done better."
good,"This place is kind of a stepping stone for going to Boeing or another Aerospace company.  It is not uncommon for people to work in the same location for long periods of time and not get cross trained in anything else.  When people try and get something else to do it is because they asked to work in another department.  "
good,"The culture is set up for the management and engineers, the traditional work force has to struggle a bit to get ahead. They did offer tuition reimbursement that a lot of employees including myself took advantage of."
good,"Generally a good working culture but being a corporate american company, there times when it i frustrating and you feel the coporate policies and rules are very American centric not considering other cultures around the world. "
good,"Great team workers and management, company has great environment and culture. People are friendly and supportive, training is also provided. A lot to learn!"
good,Overall good place to work. Heavy work load but doable. Seems upper management likes to change things that are working just for they sake of doing so. They are relying on survey scores too much.
good,Company offering excellent and varied opportunities across a global structure.The overall commitment expected is significant however the rewards offered are very good.
good,"A good company with nice working environment "
good,A safe work environment but with little chance to progress with a career opportunity. The facilities are ok with on site canteen. there are three car parks so parking is ok if you get there early enough as it does fill up by seven eight am.
good,"Vorteil weitestgehend unabhängies Arbeiten innerhalb der Zielvorgaben."
good,"When I was there, the leader was excellent. He has since gone on to other roles. Marketing focus was great for product management. As such, there was plenty of opportunity for training and, in fact, they have a strategic marketing program, which was lead by the CMO and was great."
good,"Me divertí mucho en el trabajo con mis colegas, incluso cuando el departamento estaba cerrando y no estábamos seguros de si tendríamos la posibilidad de obtener puestos sustitutivos dentro de la empresa. Logramos a finalizar nuestro trabajo de manera profesional y nos apoyábamos mutuamente. Sí, el café y el té gratis era genial"
good,"I worked in R&D for a few years. It was a good place to get lots of experience in many different areas, but growth is limited unless you have a PhD. There were also way too many administrative hurdles to get anything done. It got to the point where people just accepted it and shrugged like that's how long it takes."
good,"Management is disappointing. Promotes people based on time and not experience.  as a result, ambition or success is withheld. Too many people doing too many tasks. not efficient."
good,"Good work life balance, The team is motivated at Honeywell and the business leaders encourage the technical team to come up with innovative solutions."

good,Quid pro quo kind of place to work at your job do your job right. Be on time and you will have no issues with the company. Manafers are very relaxed and easy going.
good,"Honeywell is everything you would think a big company will be.  See Dilbert cartoons for reference.  The scale is immense, the pace can be frantic at times.  Our group has gone through 3 major restructurings in 4 years.  However, Honeywell does like to promote within and has great opportunities."
good,Good company to work with for those looking for a steady  job with  good workplace culture where continuous  improvement in performance is the criterion
good,good company have good projects in hand they are recruiting for short term projects now. company has good organusation structure and reporting culture
good,One of the finest companies to work with for anybody & get enough opportunities to learn. I still remember the way how a team performs to meet the daily to year metrics (SQDICP)
good,"Una buena empresa para crecimiento profesional, pero aun falta mas dar mas oportunidad y confianza a los empleados para ocupar puestos mas importantes."
good,"I worked at Honeywell for seven years and enjoyed my internal team, however, had hoped management back East would’ve invested more in origination, engineering and project management in states such as California.  Making these investments would’ve allowed Honeywell to continue to build their brand with other well-known CA ESCO’s."
good,I like my position though there is a lack of work that concerns me. The job itself is very good and has the benefit of working out of your home with a company provided car.
good,"Day starts with the checking mails and followed by stand up meeting.In stand up meeting issues of work , issues of safety and any concerns are discussed."
good,"Honeywell is starting to take the risks needed to move into the modern, software-centric product universe. There are many opportunities across the globe if one is willing to relocate."
good,I came in as a PP&C Analyst and was told it is a Ace of Spades type of job. I would have multiple different job duties and a lot of responsibility. Trained for about a month before being given 3 different programs with 3 separate different program managers. All having a different way they liked to run their programs. Difficult but not overwhelming. Although I was able to get a handle on most of the job duties I had a hard time getting one particular program manager to stay on task. Eventually we had a lot of long tenured coworkers leave and we were bought out
good,"If you love what you do then every place or work is fine for you."
good,"Great people mostly."
good,"Worked in Iraq as contractor/temporary employee.  Honeywell was sub-contractor to Northrup Grumman. Prime/NGC lost contract and so ended employment. Northrup offered more benefits, but much lower pay rate,"
good,"Falta de oportunidades de  crecimiento debido al bajo perfi de liderazgo de la gente encargada del area de caseline 2018, por lo demas las prestaciones estan bien, es una buena empresa..."
good,"It's a great place to work, it's inclusive, culture diversity, treat employees fair, feed them lunch everyday. A place where you can unwind, play some ping pong, foots ball and even Xbox. I enjoy coming to work."
good,"Good company, great benefits. It is a great multi-national company. Depending on what department is how the management is available to help. Very responsible as for government compliance part. More of an Engineering site in PR."
good,"Fun workplace with good colleague, good managers, good salary and benefit but not to secure because anytime can be retrenched although permanent position."
good,A great Place to work if we did not loose Large Contracts. This is a truck based service company. The Main office is South Denver. There  a long commute back to Northern Colorado.
good,it was a decent job my duties included all aspects of Accounts receivable & collections. I had to do numerous spreadsheets for different departments and it was a very interesting job.
good,"Great coworkers. Management was difficult at times. Constant outsourcing was in motion, not much work at the current time.  Hopefully aerospace sector will improve"
good,Proces gestuurde bedrijfscultuur. Rapportages belangrijk onderdeel van dagelijkse gang van zaken.
good,I would recommend working for Honeywell if you are able to contribute a minimum of 50 hours a week and are open minded to new concepts as Honeywell requires all their employees to be open minded.
good,"The organisation is full of learning opportunities. The trick is you need to keep your eyes open and have a zeal to take initiatives."
good,"Buena empresa en mi tiempo tuvo muchoa cambios lo que genero inestabilidad, estancamientoo en sueldos y posibilidades a nuevas posiciones."
good,"I loved working for Honeywell, but they outsourced me to Bucharest, Romania. Money talks. Otherwise I was given every opportunity to develop my expertise and leadership style."
good,Just do my job and sometime do other job according what superior want. Good envirionment which no push from superior and happy doing a job given also easy to understand what job we do.
good,Honeywell is a great place to work. The only complaint that I would have about it is that there is hardly any room for employees to grow. if hat were not an issue I would stay there until my time would end.
good,"Honeywell was a good company that afforded me a great opportunity to learn and advance within the company.  At time we had a manager that was not good and caused a bad working environment.  "
good,"Depending of which business do you work, you can have a great team, great direct supervisor, as well as great career development. With recent changes on CEO and some Business presidents, Company has shifted from long term vision oriented to short term."
good,"Clock in and check e-mail.  "
good,"Hardest part lately we lack capacity to meet MPS, we are falling behind in aged wip."
good,Culture is interesting and lots of people to learn from. Learned a ton about large company life. Management structure is HUGE. The hardest part of the job is the mix of conflicting processes.
good,It's a good company to work with. The working culture is okay to all staff. I have learn so many things with Honeywell flourmills plc. Have gone for trainings.
good,"Most of my knowledge of Honeywell is now obsolete, as I worked for them a long time ago."
good,"Strong management, good employee training and strong market positions. They invested in employee growth. "
good,Given real challenges - have learned a lot here. Work for some great leaders. Global teams and projects. Great technology. Mature operating systems to drive performance.
good,"Talented people to work with and challenging projects to manage. Cost Point and Deltek systems for procurement, accounting, and Materials Requirements Planning ( MRP)."
good,High Turnover Rate at executive levels but overall a good company.  Great use of technology and resources to work with customers and the salesforce.  High pressure environment that holds people accountable if they do not meet plan.
good,"Great if your face fits but as soon as they have what they want, you're dropped like a stone. Management is patchy at best & often the so called managers are full of their own importance. "
good,As subcontractors Honeywell did not get a lot of assistance from the prime contractor but outstanding assistance from the Honeywell Team. Great company to work for.
good,Best place for the people who wants to gather knowledge. More opportunities to work with different people from different countries. Exposure to different technologies.
good,"Lots of action.  Very Challenging.  Very good on training.  Invests in its people.  If you are willing to relocate, the opportunity is there.  Works with suppliers and customers."
good,"This place can be a great place to work or it can be problematic. I was there during the difficult years when the stock price was dropping and management all the way to the top were losing their heads. In three years I had 6 managers.  Depends on the time and who your manager is. Otherwise, good processes."
good,"Easy job with good pay and great benefits, but less then satisfaction management. I’ll recommend this job to anyone who can put up with nonsense for a easy paycheck"
good,Honeywell is not a bad place to work the people or great and some of the upper management is ok.problem is is lack of experience people there and cant get good training
good,"Professional environment with great people.  There are some management problems.  Good benefits and fair pay, but raises are small.  It's a large company with many opportunities if you are willing to relocate."
good,Excellent in managing cash cow businesses. HOS is an excellent system that drives the culture for process improvement. SMT is outsourced. Needs to look beyond Aerospace for growth.
good,"Typical 8 hour day. Company culture/management varies by site location. Overall good company. Company allows a lot of employee freedom. If open to relocation, vast opportunities across US."
good,"Alrite current worker through agency "
good,"Great mature global corporation with enviroment of continuous improvement for all processes, supported by Six Sigma methodology adopted by Honeywell globally. "
good,Employees had periods of unpaid furlough and repeated RIF cycles/organization restructure which ultimately affected employee engagement and satisfaction.  It's hard to keep high caliber talent in that environment.
good,"good job, good people, potential to become permanent employee but Human Resources/hiring is extremely slow."
good,Excelente estrutura física e operacional.
good,A good company to work for. Name is internationally recognized. Benefits were competitive and management very reasonable. Plenty of opportunity to transfer among other divisions.
good,Honeywell started to develop a new healthcare line dedicated to supporting DOD Initial Outfitting of medical facilities with limited success and the division was eventually closed.
good,"The culture of Honeywell's new Atlanta Software Center is very awesome, but it's not without its growing pains. Top executives are concerned that the software center isn't yet making money after slightly less than a year of being open. Almost all projects are new endeavors and there are no real contracts like you would have in a normal IT consulting firm. As such it takes longer to realize the value. "
good,"The Customer Service branch relocated to Mexico.  The organization was a good organization as a whole. Unfortunately, Honeywell decided that they will perform better in another country."
good,I my role I managed the distribution operations that serviced all the global production facilities that produced control systems for the Oil and Gas industry.
good,"I manage a portfolio of over 100 projects (ESPC, energy performance contracting) with a team of engineers. Total portfolio brings in a revenue of over $10 million per year with a healty margin of 50%."
good,"I worked hard on making sure my program met Program Objectives. This was accomplished by working the Orion Team, coordinating changes thru the planning processes, SIOP and OTTR meetings and when needed coordinated immediate changes with the Master Schedulers to resolve these issues proactively. I worked a lot of hours and weekends during the early build planning and production cycles. "
good,"Defensa contractor outfit, a unión Shop where not everybody das motivated to do a days work. A lot of good people to work  with, das hard to e ver get any overtime."
good,This is a company with a lot of history and a much older culture. Home office is great but the sites and other headquarters are not as nice. Looking forward to seeing a change ahead
good,"Good benefits"
good,I love my job and my customers.  I have learned a lot working at Honeywell.  They have a pretty decent training program and classes that you can sign up for.  I learned SAP and a couple different phone systems as well as working in a safety first environment.
good,"Worked closely with engineers to work out project issue, which help gain more knowledge about the job your working on...Also having a great relationship with your manager and other employees on the site......Working to together as a group is the best thing about it.."
good,"I enjoy working at Honeywell, but the management team can be very risk-averse to a fault.  The benefit aren't very good and there is trend towards worse offerings.  With that said, the work has been very rewarding and they reward top performers well."
good,"pick orders, wrap orders, off load freight, verify freight use SAP to put in orders in the system. off load parcels from UPS, FedEx, and DHL. verity everything as everything that comes in has to ship out that same day. At the end of the day load skids to trailers and wait for paperwork at the end of the day to release the trailers."
good,"Working at Honeywell can be described as competitive and fast paced.  The salaries are competitive, and the benefits are adequate.  However the company suffers from poor management structure."
good,Great opportunity to show what your made of. Customers dont lie. Learned all manufacturing processes to produce quality products. Cost cutting I think has gone to far. We went 6 mo without supervision and product went to customers without any drama.
good,"Good place to work , clean ,5+1 status, employees are friendly and work together as a team . Good benefits if your a perm . employee! Guarded gates , so your car is safe. Can get a drink whenever you want because they want to be sure you're hydrated, so you're healthy and working at comfortable capaity."
good,"Honeywell has such a diverse portfolio.  They have sites all over the world in Specialty Chemicals, Electronics, Aerospace, and Automotive Parts...I'm sure I've forgotten some.  The company is very stable overall since they have divisions that offset one another with the swings in the economy.  The site associated with this review (only part of my tenure with Honeywell) converts uranium ore into UF6 for shipment to enrichment plants.  That particular site has been plagued for decades with labor and management issues, and has been in the national news for such over the years.  Aside from that site, I'd recommend working for Honeywell."
good,"Fast-paced and high stressed environment. Above average benefits and pay. Smart and great people, but don't get too used to your work team because things change quickly and often."
good,Honeywell has a well matured team known for its strong program management and technical innovation capabilities. Some of the process requirements and bureaucracy tend to pull down the otherwise lively work culture.
good,was a very nice place to work and i enjoyed my employment there learned a lot . managers and customers were nice and friendly. the only downside is contractual job programs they partake in. thats all the details i have at the moment
good,"Good life work balance"
good,"Overall a great experiance working at Honeywell!"
good,"A typical day at work starts generally at site."
good,"es una empresa donde se puede trabajar agradablemente...y se preocupa por sus empleados, solo que cuando no eres personal directo de la empresa no gozas de los mismos beneficios"
good,I found the managers at Honeywell were very helpful and would provide additional help when required. Believed in education and training. Projects were interesting and exciting. Given opportunities to grow and succeed. The Engineering Department was very process oriented with many design reviews.
good,"Safety oriented, laid back, friendly co workers, good communication, lots of overtime, clean conditions, fair pay, rotating shifts, I=a good place to work"
good,"Organised workflow."
good,"An excellent place to work and build your career. Good work life balance. Good job culture, coupled with decent salary and benefits. Management is supportive."
good,great place to work especially if you are interested in getting acclimated to the aviation industry. Would recommend this place to younger people to get a jump on retirement
good,"Good working culture, privacy to your personal life and work balance between professional and personal. Too much of process and less connectivity with new markets."
good,"I often recommend taking a conservative approach to safety items, this gives us a margin to learn with out making mistakes, I struggled to get this point across to senior management"
good,"Honeywell is the best job that I have had.  The culture is supportive and empowering.  The HOS (Honeywell Operating System) is the process that guide business decisions.  The people at Honeywell form its key strategic advantage and make Honeywell a great place to work."
good,"Thinking about new technology and honeywell is not behind it, always creates new technologies for the betterment of the world. "
good,Szerettem ott dolgozni csak a fizetésem nem volt arányos az elvégzett munkával.
good,The work life Balance is better for those employees who does admin and office Jobs. However for those who are engaged in Project and site Management works lack proper support and facilities from Management.
good,"Not allowed to help other departments and utilize all of my talents."
good,"Honeywell and Honeywell Analytics (where I worked) is heavily focused on marketing, product management, and developing products bases on solid VOC. They are also a very structured company, being ISO certified, everything is documented. They do a very good job promoting from within."
good,"Es una buena compañía para trabajar, pero no una compañía donde se presenten muchas oportunidades para crecer."
good,"I have no regrets working with Honeywell, the defense division is very slow and at this time there are not many other opportunities to stay on with the company."
good,"Flexible working times,"
good,management is weak. due to the lack of proper planning of projects i have to change the company. Honeywell is largest mnc  company it was a great opportunity to work with them.
good,"I loved my time at Honeywell, I did regret being laid off due to economy. It helped me grow myself, even when I had being to the same job previously. Goal ordinated, very professional company where the employees safety is one of the highest priorities."
good,The M/s. Honeywell is good company and supported lot to all the people. Here learn more things to system . Here they are doing all the advanced system for safety and security of building.
good,"Fast paced manufacturing environment"
good,"The good things"
good,Honeywell is a great place to work. The employees are very kind and bosses are very laid back and fun. The only thing that i didn't enjoy was all the overtime it got a little hectic at times. The job is very easy and lots of opportunities to advance which is a huge plus about the job.
good,Allowed complete ownership of the telemetry business units for distribution utilities companies.  Provided training to internal and external customers.  Travel was approximately 35% - 50% of the time.  Supervised local Technical Support staff.
good,"I enjoyed my time there. I was a contract employee who they decided not to hire permanently. I personally feel they lost a great employee when I left, but I understand budget cuts and the bottom line. Overall they were a great bunch of people and the company, culturally was heading in a good direction. Leadership needed more training but it wasn't anything a little coaching couldn't fix."
good,Challenging environment great for early in career opportunities.  Benefits packages are getting worse through the years.  Long hours as career develops.
good,Attention is given to provide customer satisfaction.  Customer commitments and quality are given high priority.  Declining customer sales driving cost reduction actions.  But team is focused on its commitments.
good,"I work 2nd shift and the people I work with are very easy to get along with. I really like the Supervisor but not a big fan of upper management. The site Supervisor is a good guy but corporate really keeps his hands tied. At least from what I've seen. I really like the work but a couple of times a year there is a big push. That can lead to a lot, sometimes mandatory overtime. Overall it is not a bad company to work for but don't expect a  lot of opportunity for advancement."
good,"Although provided  winter clothing, the warehouse is still freezing, during the winter months, no heating in the warehouse I worked in. However one of the areas better employers. Pay, benefits, good. Most of the FLM's are pretty good too."
good,"Overall, Honeywell is a good company to work for.  There is a high focus on taking the initiative, and you won't succeed if you don't.  That being said, if you ask for help you will receive it."
good,"Working with Honeywell was like working with a well oiled machine.  It was impressive and structured, but at times lacked that personal touch of a smaller company."
good,"I enjoyed my job during the 18 years I worked there. I enjoyed fellow employees and the daily task that were before me. Troubleshooting machinery,my empolyees that worked for me. Feeling of daily accomplishments."
good,"enjoyable, great team building, learned to advance and overcome obstacles. efforts do not go unnoticed."
good,"Honeywell is a great company to work for in a tough economy. The company has grown in the 5 years I have been here. Although the growth has been mostly from acquisitions, Honeywell could do much to grow organically. Being an industrial company, it is sometimes hard to influence the use of successful technologies that could improve existing processes. I also feel it is tough to learn new skills like cloud technologies because the businesses I support aren't doing anything new. I have had great learning experiences here and this is the first public company I have worked for. Overall, a positive experience."
good,"Conference calls with different Honeywell engineering, development and networking teams. "
good,"Work culture is good,Management should focus on each employee of different level. Salary is bit less than other company."
good,Un dia tipico en el trabajo es llegar a checar con el gafete en la entrada. Verificar las ordenes de producción del turno de la noche. Analizar la producción. Encargarse del material a ocupar en cada orden. En caso de falla de maquina avisar a técnico de mantenimiento. Comprobar si las ordenes ya están surtidas en el sistema. Cerrar ordenes en caso de que se haya culminado la orden.
good,"You get what you out into your work.  You have to learn to maintain a balance between your work and life, otherwise the volume of work can easily cross over into your other life.  There are days where you have no choice but to work extra just to catch up to the sheer volume that is required.  Management is too focused on the current numbers and not focusing on the long term, that is what happens when you are paid incentive linked to your current performance.  Compensation is never at the top of the market place, Honeywell typically prides it self on paying at the 85% market level.  Retention of talent is a problem.  Your coworkers are what makes this place a joy to be here, great teamwork spirit and willingness to learn and develop."
good,"Computer troubleshooting, custom system builds and complete staff computer refresh, printer servicing, customer service. Great place to work."
good,Its very good place to work at fresher time.. career growth  People are great and fun filled. enjoyed time with team and learn new things.
good,"Team Spirit"
good,I was given an opportunity to work with a company that provides asset to the United States Marine Corps warfighters deployed abroad.
good,I like the job it was very fair with the salary. unfortunately it had extremely long hours and required way too much traveling.
good,Very good company to work with to enhance my knowledge as well as utilizing the same to achieve the goal of company and self. Learning opportunity is huge.

good,"HAT is good place to start with and seek for further grow inside or outside. "
good,"First meeting of the day was 5.30am and on conference calls all day."
good,Le métier est très intéressant car les produits proposés sont impliquants (EPI). Très bon management qui favorise l'apprentissage et la transmission de savoir.
good,"prepared products for stress testing in multiple areas"
good,Most enjoyable part of job is the variety of product and opportunity to learn.  Educational assistance is available. Long term employment opportunity and encouraged.  Quality and safety oriented.
good,"Helped in becoming better professional, team management, customer relationship buildup and gather business acumen"
good,"It was really a wonderful, innovative, productive and unforgettable journey throughout my tenure in Honeywell. It was a great learning experience for me, as journey started as Assembly floor."

good,"A empresa possue muita interação com seus escritórios em todos os países."
good,"Good company to work for a work life balance, ability to work remotely for some positions.   Coworkers were caring and more like family."
good,"This is a great company, but sometimes they specialize someone too much in one topic, that if you want to switch activities is hard to find an opportunity."
good,"My co-workers and colleagues were a pleasure to work with. Team work was our mantra. I enjoyed the ability to telecommute rather than reside in a dark cubicle. I learned many facets of the Aerospace Industry over the course of my 15 year career with Honeywell, they certainly were advocates of continuous learning."
good,"Honeywell is an enormous corporation, and with that comes a very corporate environment. However, it also comes with the opportunity to work on products ranging from electronics like control systems and avionics to automotive turbochargers and aircraft gas turbine engines. The opportunity for promotion within the same position varies depending on business group and department, but there are constantly opportunities to move within the company and experience different products or change job roles."
good,"Working at Honeywell has exposed me to many skills and jobs I wouldn't normally have gone after.  I was contracted as an expeditor to chase parts for production and within six months, I was managing a senior buyer's desk while he was out on sick leave.  I was hired as a buyer soon after and I've learned everything from procurement to planning, quality, logistics, program management, etc.   I have to understand how things work in order for me excel and Honeywell gave me the opportunity and the confidence.  Many of my co workers have been there for 15-20 years and their knowledge helped me to succeed and take my job to another level."
good,"My typical day was 70% on production floor."
good,"At typical day at work would start at 7am. As this job required 100% travel, my team and I stayed in a different hotel every night. In the morning we would drive several hours to the job site. work for about 5 or 6 hours, then drive several hours to the next hotel. repeat, repeat, repeat..."
good,"Pleasant working environment, goof co-workers. The hard of job are many travels, between 75 and 90 percent of time, no benefits by it..."
good,"Es un buen ambiente de trabajo pero busco mejores prestaciones no solo de bolsa de trabajo, ya que tengo 1 año 3 meses con bolsa de trabajo"
good,Fun Work Place with Supportive management. Not all about numbers  but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of Red Tape and Politics.
good,"Great environment, close knit team. Always a new challenge everyday.  Opportunities to work with different types and levels of Engineers with large responsibilities each day for accurate, timely product."
good,"It is an enjoyable place to work and my peers are both very good in assisting and in taking and accepting advice. Having to learn all that is involved with the HOS philosophy and way to get things done has been a learning curve after working 30+ years in a small, privately owned but world leading technology in Laser Scanning and Laser Scanning Systems. Small company many hats were worn and knowledge of the entire manufacturing processes were essential. Large, world wide company not nearly as much knowledge needed, expected or appreciated."
good,High pace mix mode production environment... Excellent quality... CEO for all of Honeywell  is an AWESOME leader... Excellent place to work...
good,Honeywell Aerospace.  Great company overall.  Had good work/life balance with my particular manager.  Management incentives available.
good,"I work here more than 3 years as a contractor via MGS."
good,They have great structure at Honeywell. They always keep you in the loop about upcoming events or projects. Would work for them again.

good,Large company with a variety of instrumentation and equipment to learn.  Also lots of training of safety and operation.
good,I have worked for Honeywell for 24 years. It's a nice place to work and a great atmosphere. I have a great boss. It is just time for me to find something else.
good,Honeywell aerospace will require a great deal of technical knowledge and an ability to preform at the highest productivity level.
good,"Typical day at work is varied and busy."
good,"Wonderful vacation and PTO time for a brand new employee, other than that you get worked like a dog for not much pay or recognition."
good,the job was meanly about operating a cherry picker/stand up forklift. we had a goal of 20 an hour far as picking products. the management was alright but the time to yourself and family? you had none working from 3pm-2am. my co-workers were nice and helpful. the hardest part of the job was knowing you wont get a day off besides Sunday and people being in your way due to not having alot of room the work with operating your picker. the most enjoyable part of the job was the pay!
good,"Great team members"
good,"There is definitely a lot of opportunity at Honeywell. I have been in involved in a lot of interesting projects that provided many opportunities for professional growth. Honeywell does encourage learning and development. There is very little technologies that they don't have their ""hands"" into. "
good,"very good management and systematic and pleasant environment."
good,"aprendí muchas cosas en esta empresa,que me ayudo en mi formación personal y de trabajo,a nivel empleado el ambiente es excelente, ya a nivel direccional es buena, a veces se tenia que correr un riesgo para que la producción fuera mas efectiva, antes se tenia el apoyo de liderazgo de la empresa, y no respetar la experiencia del personal"

good,"There are lot of things we can learn here. As a graphics designer, I learnt not only designing, but also the e-learning programming, management of work and business principles."
good,Team work... between staff and employee helps to enforce the unity within the work force. The Team chief works with each individual employee to ensure understanding in providing customer service.
good,"No dia a dia você tem suas atividades gerenciadas por seus coordenadores, a gerencia é centralizadora, todos os detalhes devem passar por eles.Os colegas de trabalho são otis, sempre preocupados com o seu desenvolvimento, pois se você for bom no que faz, irá se destacar e isso é um problema para a equipe. Uma vez que seu aumento salarial depende do desempenho e os gestores só concedem aumento para os melhores, contudo eu me sentia mal, pois sempre fazia tudo muito bem e isso incomodava muito os demais."
good,"Everyday presented a new challenge that had me jumping out of my bed to greet each morning. I worked with amazing individuals who made my job both enjoyable and educational; there was never a lack of original ideas when it came to our discussions about solving important issues. Working in such an environment was enlightening and provided daily opportunities to learn and grow as an engineer."
good,"In job have to travel a lot"
good,"Formulate  solutions to meet customer’s binder and/or hot mix specification"
good,"I work long hours, usually from 7:00 to 5:30 including Saturdays. At Honeywell I have crossed trained positions and consequently have learned different trades. Management is very flexible, which makes my job easier. The hardest part of my job is that we have a large workload most of the year. The the most enjoyable part of my job is that in our department everybody gets along and supports each other."
good,"Good place to work:"
good,"It's a great work environment for people straight out of college.  The employees are generally young and get along well.  Management is mostly amicable.  Compensation in terms of salary is competitive, but other benefits are lacking.  Life insurance is much worse than average, the two weeks of vacation given don't roll over (nor does comp time), they don't offer flex hours, and 401k matching is about average."
good,"I absolutely loved my job at Honeywell but being a single parent and required to work 10 to 12 hours a day, 7 days a week for well over a year was just not healthy."
good,"Overall company is good and cares about employees."

good,"Really enjoyed my coworkers"
good,"A typical day was picking and packing all orders from all over the world. After packing orders I had to ship them but ups, fed-ex, or freight. I learned lots of new computer programs, an learned about items being shipped. Management was good, kind of all over the place but not to bad. Co-workers were good people to be around. Fun but serious environment.  Hardest part of the job was making sure all orders were packed a out the door by 5pm. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,"decent pay good management. A lot of experience in space programs, Flexible work schedules"
good,"internationale dynamische sfeer, veel verantwoordelijkheid en zelfstandigheid"
good,"is good company to work for,its safe and good place to work,......."
good,I worked directly for the prime contractor. I enjoyed my job and got to work with great management in a challenging arena.

good,"It  is a good company, good learning environment, management does not put pressure, very good team work."
good,"good products and technology, many internal changes which often creates internal vs external focus.  US centric in it's North American structure.  Opportunity to move around - large company."
good,The only problem I have currently is the implementation of automated test equipment has reduced my chosen career almost totally to simple button pushing
good,Overall my reviews are all positive and have received an increase in each of my 6 years employed there.
good,"Positive working, fast pace environment. A lot of opportunites to improve and implement good ideas."
good,Started off with a production meeting. Goals were set for the day. Everyone got along well and the work got done. Management was good at staying out of our way.
good,Assembly fire alarms while following procedures to maximize output.
good,"A typical day can consist of very demanding schedules and deadlines from different tasks fro different projects at the same time. You gain a lot of knowledge from the various navigation systems that you get to program. Management is mostly business focused, which sometimes seems little pro-employer oriented. The co-workers are fun and very available to help and give support. The hardest part is the tight schedules and deadlines. The most enjoyable part is the embedded systems programming."

good,Thankful for the opportunity to work there.  My education was paid for and the work/life balance allowed me to be an active parent at my child's school.
good,Leaned a lot from older peers.  Company has really great employees that are helpful to each other.  Work life balance is good and managers are understanding.
good,Was only working seasonal but contract was supposed to work 10 months. Was very disappointed that they have to lay me off for shortage of work. But wanted to go back there to work
good,"My experience was limited, as well as my interactions with a variety of the staff so consider those factors:"
good,"The company is highly focused on appearing lean for investors and analysts, so there are often restrictions on travel, hiring freezes, and limited opportunities to advance in place.  However, there is a culture of encouragement to move around to gain new skills and experience."
good,"Mucha carga de trabajo diario, salario bajo en mi caso"
good,"Environnement de travail confortable, professionnel mais très étouffé par réunions inutiles. En plus, la possibilité d'avancement est très vague. J'étais dans un département entry-level qui en fait offrait nules possibilités d'avancement: pour gagner une nouvelle position il fallait des abilités qu'on gagne pas où je travaillais. Le recruitement pour les chefs de département se faisait toujours à l'éxterieur de la compagnie. En outre, les salaires étaient bonnes et ils faisaient des efforts pour faire le travail plus agréable."

good,"As a large international company it is a good place to work.  "
good,"Honeywell has provided me with continuous opportunities for development and advancement.  I had the opportunity to choose what roles I wanted to apply for and was able to move locations repeatedly during my time there.  Working in HR doesn't lend itself to a ""typical"" day, but generally would allow for meetings with business leaders, employees, project work, and focused time for work.  They are a conservative company with multiple levels of approvals for everything, which can be cumbersome.  Employees are unable to work from home on a regular basis, which is a difficult sell for prospective candidates.  Salaries within HR are very competitive, and HR has been a strategic function for several years."
good,"I found Honeywell to be a very challenging place to work, there is a lot to learn.  But once everything comes together it is very satisfying.  The hours can be flexible, and at one time they were offering telecommuting (this may no longer by the case).  The culture was open and friendly.  Slighly heavy on meetings, but most are done via telecommuting instead of in conference rooms due to the spread out nature of the company.  They are very strong believers in hiring from within and not hiring externally unless they absolutely have to."
good,"Strong performance as a company overall, but limited focus on what the mission is and what the strategy should be.  Figuring out what they want to be should be top priority."
good,As an intern I was presented with an array of interesting and meaningful things that I could do within the company to both solve real world problems and increase my knowledge.
good,"I worked in Global Supply Chain doing project management focusing on inventory optimization.  After two years, for unknown reasons, I could not get on permanently with the group. They never gave me a chance to be promoted.  I left HON, a place I loved, at Deer Valley and quickly advanced to Management and then in 1 year to Senior Management at another Fortune 500 company where I continue to have great success."
good,"- Best team to work"
good,It has been over 24 years since I worked at Honeywell so I don't know why this question is being asked of me. The Indeed site needs to have its algorithm more flexible.
good,Military Contract with very strict demands to please or meet the customers needs. Which was USMC. Most  management and employees were prior military service.

good,"This job is good! Friendly place to work, clean light and airy, good variety of tasks to do throughout the shift. Various shift patterns to choose from: Day shifts as well as rota shifts. Plenty of breaks, 2x 15 min and 1x 30 min. Ongoing temporary work via agency"
good,"The internship is a work in progress but it is a great experience if you're willing to put your best foot forward. You have to be willing to ask for things and figure things out yourself. This is not the type of internship where they ""baby"" you. The internship sets you up pretty good though. Also, working for a Fortune 100 company never hurts your resume."
good,Honeywell was a great company to work for. Unfortunately our contract job working for Nstar expired and I found work elsewhere. Very flexible work hours.
good,"Liked the overall benefits package.  Safe work environment.  Had a strict hierarchy in reporting structure -- almost a ""need to know"" culture.  Not a lot of advancement opportunities."
good,Ojts cross training learn to improve self-confidence good management good work environments ter board meetings stand-up meetings Town Hall meetings every quarter meetings management gives every employee opportunity to get certified in different sales
good,"Typical work day included getting ready with a standup meeting then dividing up the workload between Technicians, hardest part of the job was communication between different shifts as things could get left out or not mentioned."
good,"Working for Honeywell was an exciting and challenging experience. Working with customers to resolve order issues or assist with entering orders was my primary responsibility. I enjoyed it. I also ran open order reports, daily sales reports. Analyzed data and managed a document library. I was excited and proud to become an employee of Honeywell then within six months of hire they announced customer service department is being outsourced. I was terribly sad."
good,"A typical day at work consists of arriving at a job site, filling out a risk assessment and commissioning temp control devices. Interfacing with contractors is common. My immediate manager is good, any higher than that and it is a very corporate atmosphere."

good,Great Company. Good opportunity to interact in a true global company. Very good chance to understand the meaning of working in a cross cultutal team no collocated
good,"I truly enjoyed my employment at Honeywell Aerospace in Phoenix, AZ from time to time. However, sometimes it felt like the company projects were dragging and I was left with little to say about things, in addition to having redundant, non-productive meetings with too many project engineers. For example, I was often told that things had been done that way for 30 plus years, so no need to change them...Wrong, I totally don't agree! Also the work environment was a little old fashion, with huge cube farms and office furniture from post WW2 era."
good,"- Daily stand up for status update"
good,It's a lot of work and always something new to service and install. Management is very helpful to service technician and installers. It's a  very large corporation with a lot of different department.  Great company to bad they sold off there security division..
good,"Company is a great place to grow careerwise in terms of knowledge and management skills. People are ever ready to help in terms of knowledge and expertise. Moreover, in order to deliver effective solution to client , they are ready to assimilate new technologies and skills."
good,Good career opportunities if you are in the right group and location. Company is constantly cutting benefits in order to increase stock price. Lower level people are just a number.
good,"Team focused group"
good,"Dynamic and fast-paced multi-language working environment, promoting specialist training and continuous improvement. Customers are the first focus for the order management and customer care teams."
good,"Buen lugar de trabajo donde hay buen trabajo en equipo, empresa comprometida con el cliente aunque no tanto con el trabajador por los largos dias laborales incluyendo fines de semana."
good,"Nice Culture for staff."
good,The environment is such that advancement is highly encouraged.  They want you to continue to gain training and education in hopes that you can climb the job ladder within the company.
good,"al iniciar el día laboral, preguntábamos a los compañeros del otro turno los pendientes o urgencias que se habían presentado. si el día era muy tranquilo nos poníamos a limpiar el área, honeywell es un empresa muy limpia. lo mas difícil es no encontrar la falla de un equipo eso era un dolor de cabeza pero a la ves aprendías mucho de cada problema"
good,"This company provided everything necessary for career development in engineering. However, there were many lay-offs placed periodically throughout the year which kept employees on their toes."
good,"The main requirement was to take calls, but there was also chat support and I assisted with writing the knowledge base. Most shifts were quite enjoyable, but management left a little something to be desired."
good,The site I worked at was unique from the majority of the rest of Honeywell. While an engineering company the facility in which I worked was also a nuclear facility as it produced UF6 for the beginning of the nuclear fuel cycle. This caused challenges with communicating the needs of the facility to the corporate entities who made decisions about the facility without understanding the nuclear requirements of our site. The pay was good the benefits decent but corporate often overruled local decisions regardless of the sites unique needs and that was frustrating.
good,"Being a contractor I didnt really have any job security due to the nature of contracting. The canteen is subsidised and the food is really nice. The employees are very god to work with, friendly and accommodating. Some managers are ""jobs worths"" and go out to find issues with people in other departments rather than fix their own department. Most workshop managers are great and have a wide variety of experience."
good,"La gestione dell'azienda è quella di una multinazionale americana. Molta attenzione alla salute e sicurezza dei lavoratori con frequenti corsi di aggiornamento. Per i Sales Manager flessibilità con corporate card e auto aziendale, con software di gestione viaggi (Concur). Utilizzo di moderni software di gestione aziendali come SAP, SalesForce e Skype. Interconnessione globale con tutte le aziende del Gruppo"

good,"Well organised , good for development."
good,"Got this job when i got out of the Marine Corps.  Was sad to leave, but was laid off.  I did CNC programming for lathes and mills in the machine shop."

good,"Managers are always allow to help their personal"
good,Every year company has family day for all employees and at Christmas employees are given a Christmas lunch names are drawn for gifts. Employees also can get tickets to.be used to purchase from the company store.
good,"Good place to work but is tied to a dying network (Inmarsat D)."
good,"They are really trying to instill a good work culture. But not much job security. Good house keeping. "
good,"Good company to start with but not for long time survival and growth. Good working culture however, no on site exposure. Hence, learning curve declines."
good,I liked working for Honeywell however when the company was purchased I knew it was a matter of time before I would be let go so I started looking for a job. I left for a better opportunity.
good,"Good Company. Issue & problem with Honeywell are the lack of pay increases based on job title & position... Honeywell has become an upper mgmt Co, that get the big bonuses."
good,"Good job for chemical engineers to start a career. Lots of international projects with good exposure to different technologies. However, sometimes doing the same thing, again and again, can feel boring."
good,"With the department I worked for, the work/life balance was excellent. It was very flexible. I found their communication inadequate and unprofessional at times."
good,Normal 40 hour week.  Collaboration.of projects is encouraged.  Employees must stay engaged with Management.  Family work balance tends more toward family.  The hardest part of the job was lack of test resources.  The most enjoyable part of the job was completing tasks.
good,"Honeywell is very progressive in the development of their employees, safety, ethics, Lean and Six Sigma.  You can start at the bottom, work very hard and promote.   If you embrace change, you will feel Honeywell is a fit.  The company has high expectations of their employees.  In return, their benefits package is excellent.  They are one of the few companies that offer pensions."
good,I enjoy working for Honeywell.The culture is competitive and fast past. Honeywell is not for the faint-hearted.Honeywell provides exceptional training and coaching to employees. The hardest part of the job is the frequent changes required to keep pace with the markets.
good,"As with most places, good and bad days.  Typically on 2nd shift.  Due to several folks leaving was put on 3rd shift and this was a difficult transition.  Most days are busy.  Due to the Honeywell acquisition, it has been more stressful."
good,100'000+ employees company which offers a lot of opportunities to grow. Many processes in place to help track all the changes implemented and gather different background people all over the world around a common objective.
good,"There are a lot of options for Jr to mid-level employees to grow and move thruought the company, even to travel as company has worldwide presence. Many jobs allow to work partially remote/telecommute."

good,I had the opportunity to work in a number of departments and roles and enjoyed the people and culture of the company at that time.  Would definitely work for this company again!
good,"Honeywell Aerospace is a huge business, so there are numerous avenues for career change/advancement. A lot of great people, and opportunities to learn. The workforce is not as diverse as it could be, and there is an apparent age gap."
good,"This review is before Honeywell purchased Intermec Media. Very professional place to work, very good people. Everyone works hard, many opportunities to advance if you work hard and communicate with your management team."
good,"Everyday was hectic and stressful but at the same time, it was rewarding. The company values results. So in most cases, it is difficult but in the end things get done. People tend to be aggressive with each other."
good,"I had a fabulous manager. He was a great communicator. Did not micromanage but lead. Very stressful time of project and people were working around the clock. Honeywell went above and beyond to insure there was food, beverage and anything else they needed."
good,Diverse culture and exposure to real world problems. Hands on experience with engineers and Phds. Tremendous and valuble skills learned on the job. The company also had seminars on site for interested employees.
good,"An engineering software company that wants to move faster and become a software centric company. Has deep roots in many industries, dominator in many. But operates very traditional, quite process oriented and what not."
good,"Honeywell uses Manpower (in MP's many subsidiary incarnations) to staff its projects. Only project managers and above were Honeywell Corporation employees. I got to work closely with the project management team and had a dotted line to Corporate. Worked with 4 different project managers , who had 4 different personalities and management styles. Learned from all 4."
good,"Account Management was a great experience and very fulfilling. I enjoyed meeting new people and making new customers. It was challenging at times but you take the good with the bad. But we had a lot of management changes. I enjoyed traveling to South America the most, the people in general were very pleasant."

good,"En un día típico, se revisaba de un listado de pendientes que piezas se estaban trabajando en producción. Detectando las piezas que se están trabajando se va a producción para darle un seguimiento para realizar las instrucciones de trabajo y subirlo al sistema con el cual los operadores después podrán tener acceso y revisar la serie de instrucciones a seguir."
good,"I enjoy getting up for work each day to a fast pace environment that allows me the opportunity to stretch myself and continually learn. This is done by continually talking to customers, engaging within the industry and from my peers. As a global product manager, the hardest part of my day is having enough hours to get the job done supporting the needs across the globe. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you experience ""launch day"", the release of the product you helped create from the beginning."
good,"I can't speak for everyone, but my experience working at UOP/Honeywell was a peaceful one. Red alerts are unheard of, and we are simply sitting on our hands listening to the hum of the HVAC whist monitoring the campus via CCTV."
good,A good place to start your career and learn. Good team building practices and principles. Lots of opportunities for learning and self development and growth.
good,"Overall Honeywell is a good company to work in. it been awesome experience to work with various people, departments, explored the geographically different places"

good,"Plenty of global opportunities."

good,Its a relaxed setting that can be stressful from time to time. If you are not willing to learn and make mistakes and try again this isn't the job for you. You can not be lazy because all of the information is crucial. There is so much Honeywell has to offer and I personally wish I didn't have to leave because this is by far the best job i've ever had.
good,"Over all a good company with his brand, good working culture with appreciation. "
good,"All good. Need improvement to lean out unnecessary processes. People are good. Needs improvement in the HR team, They do not have a command for real human capital management."
good,"It was good learning opportunity, to improve your personality skills while contributing to business. It has very good brand name and good respect in the market. Some time it is fest too mush of process killing business opportunity, R&D and product development to very slow, and difficult to catch up competition."

good,"i have started my career with Honeywell as Intern,"

Lehetőségem volt külföldi gyárak mindennapjaiba bepillantani, ezáltal új technológiákat, módszereket ismerhettem meg. A vezetőség profitorientált, ezen célnak mindent alárendel, az emberi tényező másodlagos, bár propagandája nem ezt hirdeti. A munkatársak közül csak azok maradtak meg hosszútávon, akik minden tekintetben képesek voltak simulni a vállalat által szabott direktívákhoz. Monoton, fizikai munka, hibázási lehetőség rengeteg, így folyamatos koncentrációt igényel. Kellemes környezet, biztonságos, tiszta munkaterületek, versenyképes béren kívüli juttatási csomag."

Honeywell has offered many things in the past including advancement, training, and flexibility. In recent years, pension have been frozen to 2014 salaries, merits have been pushed out even with record earning years, and furloughs deployed while demand had increased. The company 401 match was cut in half and never fully re-instated as promised when the market recovered. Based on these events, I am seeking opportunities as with many other employees for a company that will stand behind their commitments."

good,"the jobs was very good and advancement was there. this was a contract job so when contract was up the job was over. "
good,"Enjoyed my time with ADI, which is a division of Honeywell. The corporate offices were not as in touch with all the branches as I figured a large company would be. Fellow employees were great to work with with the exception of one guy who was lazy and not a team player. I'm not a fan of laziness at all."
good,"Its a fast paced industry so you'll always be with a little sense of urgency. Sometimes, more often than you would like to, you'll need to work extended hours. "

good,"Having not worked for a large corporation before, there are many benefits such as others willing to help and resources to get things done. The bad parts are getting everyone in the same boat. Sometimes like herding cats."
good,I have enjoyed my working years in Honeywell. I have worked with fantastic people who are always ready to support.

good,I learned how to work with others and help company grow. I had to work with confidentiality in a grow environment. The hardest part of the job was to meet the timelines
good,"A lot of new things to learn every day from troubleshooting, test and evaluation and analyzing test results. A lot of planning and coordination of work between team members. the hardest part is that too much work that require completion on time, but due to the limited number of the employees in the team some times it results to the increase of the back-log. the overall condition of the work is acceptable."
good,Honeywell has been a great experience. Good company and great people to work with. They challenge you to think outside the box and come up with ideas to make your job easier and more efficient.
good,"The work was demanding, but also rewarding once that project was completed.  The Six Sigma learning we under took improved out productivity."
good,"My plant location within the company gradually became de-emphasized during my time there, so career options became increasingly limited unless you were prepared to move or you could commit to demanding travel requirements.  The co-workers are top-notch, and while that's a positive, it also means that career advancement within the company is commensurately difficult.  Teaming and project schedules were usually aggressive, so go-lives were consequently stressful. Some people, however, were genuinely inspiring to work with -- you could learn by observing their success factors."
good,"A work place made to feel you are doing your own business, improved the personality & skills of the employee, the hardest part of the job is you should have good employee manager to grow, the enjoyable part of the job is you are on your own & manage your business on your own"

good,We have designed an automation tool to perform graphical testing automatically without human effort and errors.
good,Project management seemed to be a problem. The outsourcing of projects to Indonesia and China was poorly thought out.

Hardest part of the job is identifying what takes priority between program and engineering requests. Management can do a better job of identifying priorities. Co-workers are great to work with. They understand the vision of the company and work hard towards it. I enjoy working with technical leads and customers to ensure that all deliverables are met on time and meet all customer requirements."

My boss and half of the team were based in the United States, so we used to meet thru videoconferences once a week to review the pipeline, assign new projects and discuss issues. We had a challenging workload with tight deadlines but being busy was great for me. I learnt to manage my time to work on several projects at the same time and deal proactively with priorities. Our team was great because we used to support each other. Personally, I used to get complex projects because I’m detail oriented, organized, dynamic, resourceful and responsible. "

good,They really took care of us there at Honeywell. I just hated that the job was only 3-months. The pay was decent and the atmosphere was enjoyable!
good,Working for Honeywell is an excellent experience. Each day is spent at an independent work place on customer sites. I am in charge of handling all Honeywell equipment maintenance and operation at the site. I am joined on site by two senior technicians assigned to the sit as well. The work load is interesting and challenging.
good,"Honeywell has an excellent track record of providing service to its customers. But no room for growth in my current position looking for new opportunities. When I started this job I had 3 other workers which we divided the work up evenly. Now I'm the only worker remaining; according to management they couldn't hire another replacement worker. So I'm doing the work for 2 people; asked for increase in compensation I have to wait until next year fiscal budget according to local management. This decision is based on saving money for the company. Which I understand saving money for the company, but the company has increased revenue for the past 3 years. Not good for long term employee growth but great for management."

good,"I was the lead for the Component Obsolescence Mitigation team. This was a very challenging position that worked in a cross-functional, global environment. The challenge was in bringing together members from each department to team up to resolve challenges to our production and customer service efforts. Moreover, many of our divisions used legacy data mining and supply management data bases, which was the basis for my writing the command media (doctrine) for the Aerospace Division"
good,I have been working here since Apr'2010 and it has been very good learning period and able to explore my knowledge.
good,"Great place to work, good management but had to leave because my job was going to be outsourced ."
good,Only issue I have is the slow rate that it takes to get things done. Management needs to learn to listen to people below them for improvements. They want to get things done faster and easier as well.
good,"Great place to work as far as WFH ability.  Benefits are on par with rest of industry.  Due to large growth, employees could be located at 1 of 4 KC sites."
good,"Trabajo bajo presión bien remunerado, pero difícil asenso"

good,"Good company to work. Good and people friendly management, working on safety critical systems. An equal opportunity company."

good,"Es una empresa con un buen ambiente laboral, con una buena administración en el área de producción."
good,"It was pleasure working with Honeywell, good team management, helpful colleagues, in-depth knowledge training of working tools, concerned about employee safety etc."
good,"I would describe my working experience at Honeywell as very rich and intense. This company provided my a platform to stretch my myself and work without borders, work with global teams in true sense. I was exposed to manage global mega projects of high complexity and with high customer expectations. The company offers and promote culture of self learning and upgrading, training through internal and external resources. The superiors are easily approachable and willing to offer guidance and navigation wherever necessary."
good,Honeywell provides world class products and opportunities for growth. The teamwork at Honeywell is exceptional and inspires growth and hard work. The workload is challenging and provides new connection with the world
good,Good experience. Safety culture is excellent. Most coworkers are easy to work with. Training is adequate for specific job duties. Union company so contract negotiations can be a bit nerve racking.

Learned a lot and even managed to help the company with technical issues and was rewarded with acknowledgement from the global management.
good,Honeywell is a strong culture but the workplace culture is not forward thinking. I enjoyed my work and the people I worked with but the culture dud nothing to motivate me. I am fortunate that I am the type of person who is self-motivating. One of the most important benefits of working at Honeywell was the training opportunities.
good,"I was my first job so learned a lot. Diverse experience. There are opportunities to grow, you need to look at the right area. Lot of work. Flexible timings. Supportive management."
good,"Safe working environment, not too great leadership though, overall good company to work for used to have a lot of perks to offer to employees but not much room for learning and grow due to leadership weekness"
good,It was a position through a recruiter. The manager said he'd hire me after 90 days. Then after 6 months. Then after talking to a few people I found out they had people there 2 years waiting on a permanent position. I left for a direct hire for more pay. The one good thing is having Honeywell on your resume goes a long way.

good,"A typical day at work involves collaborating with multiple member of your own team as well as interdepartmental employees. I have learned how to utilize SAP and Microsoft Excel extremely well. I have also learned more about how communication is key, but also just as key is having a sense of urgency and pride for the work you do. The culture is fast-paced and stressful, but I work with an amazing team and had an amazing manager that made it work worth doing. The hardest part of the job is out-of-touch upper-management. The metrics that my team (and others) are judged against are extremely counterintuitive as well as incorrect. The data is never fresh and always has mistakes; however, the upper-level managers believe 100% in the data. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely my team. My manager just quit because of the corporate culture which he was shielding us from, so that sucks; however, my team is amazing and we truly are like family. I have met so many wonderful people at this site that will be lifelong friends."

You are expected to get the result. Meanwhile, you are also expected to follow tons of policies and processes. If you are up for their game, it's a good company for long-term career development. If you hate being constrained by processes and prefers autonomy, you may find yourself painful working in that environment."

good,"This is a friendly place to work, management are really good, give you time to take care of your family or your school but i didnt see any career advancement only promesses"
good,"The hours available to work fit my schedule. Daily structure of tier meetings controlled the work need for the day. Hard to plan your day as the work schedule changed rapidly depending on the critical needs for the day. Time mangement is key to success in this kind of enviroment. Was generally left to do what I was needed to do for that day and not micro managed by management. Always enjoyed when you were invlved in solving a problem, as you felt a sense of accomplishment."
good,Working at Honeywell was great. The people are nice and helpful. I personally enjoyed working with Honeywell engineering team and everyone on the site.

good,Honeywell is a fairly positive place to work and they are willing to acknowledge you hard work and constantly encouraging you to step up you performance. Overtime is often encouraged.

This was a craft position where I was the last employee remaining on contract, both times.  We were crossing a picket line and later had to train our union replacements.  The job was very difficult but we were paid well.  There were major differences between incomes from the 1st and 2nd terms of employment though.  I worked the exact same position for the same company, very similar lengths of employment both times but I had a vested profit sharing account the first time but not the second time.  That was around $7000.00 difference.  That was a small shock to me, but that's water under the bridge."

good,I enjoyed my time there. When I first started the company name was Hand Held products. The company then was acquired by Honeywell. I learned how to use the SAP program and then learned the Guixt program. A typical day at Honeywell included getting trays of units that were sent in to be repaired and entering in the information as per the Guixt program then taking them to the repair department and placing them in the correct bins to be repaired. I worked off of a printout for the repaired units to make sure they were fixed so I could get them processed out of the system and taken to the shipping department. I would have to search for units that were on the printout but could not be found in the bins that were ready. Sometimes they were on hold. The hardest part of my job sometimes was trying to find unrepaired units that the repair persons had put elsewhere for parts. The most enjoyable part of my job was the data entry.

I never received a response from HR when asking for an exit interview. The remaining benefit of $3800 was available on my employee benefits site; however, I was told I was going to be denied due to site budget????? "
good,"- Fast paced environment within Finance"

good,"This location was probably the best place I have worked at. The environment was fun and the people were great. They had formal professional training and management were flexible and great to work with.

good,"a typical day in Honeywell is chiefly spent working in one of the many different product areas. Each different product has a varied assembly method, testing process and packing process. On day shift there is a daily tier 1 meeting where any productivity or quality issues are discussed. Should problems persist they are moved up further with engineers and management. There is also a weekly safety message which is different every week and can be quite informative. I have taken part in a lot of training which is a refreshing break from the same day to day processes. I have always got on well with the management and would say that the team leaders and managers work closely with the team which creates a good ethos. The co-workers were also very easy to get on with and made the job a lot more enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is building up your speed to match the workers on a new line. however most targets are reasonable and can be obtained within a week or two depending on the job, I wouldn't say there was a most enjoyable part of the job as the days went in quick, you can have a laugh with co workers as long as you're getting your work done."

The bulk of my work consisted of checking for messages daily to ensure that the material we had on hand was not affected in a negative manner. Other than that I helped co-workers in their job functions as we had a ""one team, one fight"" mentality. The hardest part of my job was finding things to do in order to stay busy.

In this line of business the job can be very stressfull if you fail to create a good work life balance. With a global customer base there can be a tendency of getting pulled into meetings outside of your regular hours. The most of enjoyable part of the job relates to the nature of the business in that you may be doing a different task from one minute to the next.

This particular branch had a majority of veteran workers (20 years on the job or more) making it challenging to sometimes introduce new and effective ideas regarding safety and leadership. I learned how to motivate seasoned veterans, how to get 'veteran workers' to change their attitude regarding safe work practices and safety awareness. This was the hardest part of the job. The interaction with the people and figuring out what style of coaching, leadership, and motivation each worker would respond to was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"A typical day at work would be me coming into work creating manufacturing orders for electronic employees, building raw board component level electronics, and doing QA on products.

The hardest part of my job was transitioning to a new job that i never did before but thanks to the personnel assigned to my new shop they made the transition very easy.  the most enjoyable part of my job was the personnel I worked with.
good,"HW took me with the plans to make me a certification Engineer.  I had a lot of certification experience in the flight control components, but I was not familiar with the navigation and communication equipment.  It was a win-win situation where I was expanding my scope of product line and HW was picking up an experienced engineer in certification."
good,"Most all the employees were prior military so the level of detail and output from the employees were highly regarded by the customer, in our case it was the Army, supporting War on Terrorism."

Able to eat at my desk and take a few short breaks during the work day to walk outside on the many provided paths or walking track.

good,To whom it may concern. I was a contractor with Honeywell for 10 months and had to leave because there was no move up or hiring taking place at that time. The reason I left is the pay was so low and I had to take a higher pay job. It would be nice if they look at employees work and pay them accordingly. I think I did well and didn't had the opportunity to move up. I think that subcontractors should be treated right as well because they try to work hard to do their best to get hire on.

The only downside is that overtime was extremely common due to the nature of certain jobs and the sizes of the various locations we worked at. Normally our clients were usual office buildings, schools and hospitals. The job would keep you on your feet for the majority of the day as well. It wasn't a bad thing, but the job quite literally keeps you on your toes. Another thing is that I had to drive a personal vehicle, which affected my parking situation. Since other fire inspectors had tagged vehicles which basically allowed them to park anywhere, I had to be careful to park in an area in which I wouldn't get ticketed. Overall, good experience."
good,"Everything was excellent until the company decided to transfer the department to Mexico leaving the US workers without job."
good,"I come from a Honeywell family, I’m a third generation Honeywell employee. The job and programs are awesome to work on. Teamwork is a priority for 99% of the people who work there. The programs are interesting and challenging. There are so many people who are experts that you can learn from, however the company no longer values these people, or people at all.

Co-workers were pretty good people for the most part. The exception being the gossip and things that tend to come in a factory environment in that part of the country. By far the hardest part of the job was overcoming the ""tribal knowledge"" that had been commonplace in that facility for 30 plus years.

Put another way, Honeywell is a company that one will enjoy working for but will not achieve the level of compensation that is commensurate to other industrial manufacturers."

good,Muy buena empresa. Siempre te están capacitando lo cual es bueno. Al finalizar tus capacitaciones te certifican. Retroalimentacion constante pero tiende a ser muy frustrante el trabajo y no hay mucho tiempo para relajarse ni áreas donde puedas desestresarte dentro de las instalaciones.

good,"I enjoyed my position at Honeywell, although the extreme temperatures of the outdoor weather were sometimes difficult to handle. My training was done very well, and I did enjoye it. I did not though like the fact that when a truck would leave with a radioactive product which would raise the meter, no one would say a word. Several of the people in the plant had a small meter on them that they wore, for exposure, but we who were right by these trucks when they left were there to inspect, did not get a meter!"

good,"Honestly, I should have never left.  The team was cool and helpful, some were funny, some were dead, and some were real cool.  the pay was good for the work you do, but the benefits is junk.

good,"Good place to work.  It is to bad that they are outsourcing a vast majority of jobs to low cost countries"
good,"I'd think this place was more screwed up if I'd hadn't seen a lot worse at other Aerospace companies I'd worked at. I have a positive experience here overall, I think mostly due to my most recent boss being quite good, which makes a huge impact on my overall perception of this place."
good,"They were a great company to work for until they changed up many of the things that made it a breath of fresh air to work for them.  Now they have implemented unnecessary tasks and even some that are repetitive. Those unnecessary task interfere with focusing on the job. It seems to just add busy work to already very fast-paced work place.  With these changes came a change in commission pay structure which would pay an additional $$2500 to 5000.00 plus a month.  Now they want to limit the commission based on specific brands that are not at all popular in the field. This has decreased commission to at least $1500.00 a mth, and this month we may not even get that.  Totally unfair when you work hard and close deals, you constantly meet and exceed your goals and make them money hand over fist and now they want to curb your income. It gives the impression that they ONLY care about the bottom line and not the people who put in the work to make them the $1B plus company that  they are.  I enjoy this field and wouldn't leave if not for that and a few other things that are just unbearable."

Unfortunately found myself on a toxic project, management of said project would not listen until almost everyone bailed and it was too late.

good,"A very respectable company."
good,"My review of Honeywell is the change I have seen at the company over the last 8-9 years is great. Many meetings daily and focus on the metrics, which I believe doesn't take in to account many factors. Extreme push from the top and Corporate Climbers in some departments obtains experience as they rise. Much loyalty from the worker bees and hard work. In most departments Management that stands up for and supports it's employees. Understanding of family situations and not much if any advantage taken of the Company when Management gives help and loyalty. Absolute hard working employees as a rule and very few which keep score."
good,"Able to support clients accomplishing outstanding customer service for them, Honeywell Inc., and myself.  Providing all documents and records for customers and management team with accuracy and an obvious dedication to my personal and company work ethic.  Determined to make my supervisors look their possible best.  The most difficult part of the job was; leaving a task incomplete at the end of the day.  I've learned all people (customers, clients, supervisors, subordinates and management) - all appreciate a dose of positivity if served with good intentions, knowledge, integrity and respect.  Clear communication, utmost professionalism and eye contact are appreciated.  I enjoy doing my job well by being accountable for government property and maintaining an excellent professional stance."

good,Honeywell was a good company to work for.   The company provided excellent training to the employees and treated employees with respect and dignity.
good,Good Automative Manufacturing setup with LEAN and six sigma practice.

good,A typical day at work was setup and operate the machines make sure everything was running as smoothly and safely as possible. I had all the support as far as machine maintenance and management and we always practiced teamwork. One of the hardest parts of working at honeywell was the first day there learning things ive never learned before and the amount of responsibility i was given. The best part of the job was being there it was a awesome place to work.
good,"Honeywell has a great collection of talent and when I was working was under the leadership of a great leader. The Corp level projects had projects conflicts with local business units  and that was not well managed. That resulted in a lot of waste in terms of dollars, people and morale. Great company to work in and I enjoyed working with some great people."
good,Good place to work since I already knew many of the employees. Systems and processes are a bit skewed. Improvements could be made if management would look at the entire value stream and revise conflicting requirements. Too much focus on dotting the i and not enough focus on the overall process results.
good,Honeywell is a great organization to work for but in Calgary they have downsize to the point there's no place for salespeople. Evening technical staff work out of a home office. Some of the best ethical training available. Too bad management neglects the ethical ends of the business.

good,Productive place work with a perfect set schedule. Great benefits with very decent pay. Honeywell also provides chances to move up and receive promotions.

good,Excelente en su Sistema Operativo basado en Lean Manufacturing.
good,"Typical work day was following your standardized work along with any special projects assigned from the leadership. I learned a great deal about process engineering, and lean manufacturing. The management was great. Leaders would always take whatever time they could to help develop the junior leaders, and groom them for success. Workplace culture was good. Some employees resisted the change to lean methods because they enjoyed running around putting out fires all day. Largely the workforce accepted the transition and realized it was there to help them grow, and help the team progress. The hardest part of the job was being moved to night-shift when we went from 8-hr days to 12-hr days. Most enjoyable part of the job was teaching and coaching employees lean fundamentals, and why they worked."
good,Its one of the best place to work as product compnay. i worked here for almost 50 months and had a fruitful experience. Honeywell is more process and employee oriented.

The hardest part of the job was not being compensated for the tasks I was doing on behalf of the Director, however, I did feel that the additional tasks helped me gain a remarkable set of skills.  The most enjoyable part of the job was I was never bored as being given enough work and being able to work independently without little supervision."

good,"Honeywell is still growing out of ""old"" corporate culture. There are times when you're working on something that should seemingly be easy, but you're hit with a roadblock that may take longer than you may be used to due to un-necessarily complex processes and/or a long approval chain. That seems to be heading the way of the dinosaur though - in my brief time here so far, it's already gotten better."

good,"1979 to 1985 I was a sheet metal mech. 1979 to 1980 we worked to blueprints, after that we worked to sketch sheets. I was always in over/haul and repair. We repaired aircraft engines parts.

good,"I work away from home a good chunk of the year. Maybe working 9 out of 12 months of the year near the job sites. There is a lot of travel. I love how much I'm being paid. I love what work I'm doing. I hate that I'm never home for my family. I am home on weekends, and some weeks at a time if the job site is closer to my home (2 1/2 hours or shorter 1-way). This company strives for me to continue learning, which I love. The time off is amazing-giving pro-rated time off. Benefits are nicely priced for insurance in my area. I am given a company vehicle with Per Diem for the sites that i go to. Covering any additional costs that may arise while I am working, or traveling to the job site. Management provides structure to help learn what needs to be done in the field if something seems unclear. The amount of hours that needs to be worked at the job site is a STRICT 40 hour week, unless needed for emergencies which is something I like because of the amount of time that I am usually away from the family. Normally I get overtime with the amount of traveling going to and coming from each job site, which is another positive. All in all, I'd recommend working for this company. They are very large, and if something doesn't work out in a specific field, they can help you go to a different department (after some time)."

good,"I worked at Honeywell for 16 years. During that time I was allowed to advance my position as my skill level grew, worked just about every job at the Chesterfield as well as the Colonial Heights plant and was rewarded with better pay, more responsibilities, trust and a greater understanding of how the company operates as a whole. I was given ample opportunities to be creative and was able to make changes to the processes to create a safer, more productive environment.($20 million a year improvement) The engineers are the best at support, to help the technicians produce the best products available, and management recognizes when employees perform above expected levels. Employees pull together to troubleshoot issues and work as a team to get the most production out of each day. The hardest part about the job is the day I had to leave,(my own legal issues) and I regret every second of not being part of such a terrific team and organization."
good,Be yourself and continue to learn and obtain the culture and be great. Never look away from being an asset and growing with the company continuously. Love where you work and love what you do.

good,Great place to work. Wonderful people surround the metrology program. Facilities main goal is manufacturing production for customers. People are extremely helpful .
good,"A day starts with reviewing emails, work updates and a Tier 2 meeting to review updates with the team. Management is co-operative, sets clear guidelines, goals and encourages leadership undertaking. Workplace is typical of a product oriented company with discussions and topics ranging around your domain of work and the fun aspect may be found lacking though this depends mostly on your team. I have found that most people coming from a service oriented company background find it a bit toned down when they first start here and later get accustomed. The hardest part would definitely be organizing large scale meetings since finding a suitable slot where all your stakeholders are available is difficult and challenging. But other than that as long as you are committed and dedicated to your work there is nothing menacing or to be worried about. The most enjoyable part of the work is definitely the partners and the recognition. Whether Europe or Americas, partners are cooperative and communicate well, they ensure you get to grow within the company and are supportive of the same."

Coffee was supplied by local vendor at the companies expense and someone would always bring treats for break.  A good deal of the work was the constant exchange of information between the client and the engineer.  This was necessary to achieve the milestones in the overall development of the product designed especially for the client.  Once the sign off the configuration had been accomplished, the software had to be written to provide the performance to the hardware component, and once written, the entire system is mocked up and thoroughly tested to the letter of the configuration document (authorized test procedure).  Anything amiss, corrections would be made either to the software or the hardware, and retest would be conducted.  Everyone is quick to help if asked, because getting the product delivered on time at 100% functionality is critical to remaining in business.  Developing the configuration can be painstakingly long depending on the aircraft and size and requirements of system the client is seeking. However, it can be a breeze if the system is a cookie cutter type that fleet aircraft purchase.  In any case, the product is always tested and leaves 100% functional.  The hardware is of course shipped,  but the software is uploaded to the customer, and installed at the user end.  The company produces a great product and it is accomplished by great people.  Honeywell is a wonderful place to be employed."
