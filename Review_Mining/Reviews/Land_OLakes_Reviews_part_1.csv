rating,review
bad,The worse company I ever worked for no teamwork at all nobody speaks English can not comprehend how people can be leads and not speak English they hired me for forklift operator but put me at pallets pallet sta
bad,The good is the people I work work. The bad is they dont take into count what experience someone has for other job bids. They pick and choose who they want.
bad,The management made it very difficult to work.  The manager targeted me and made it very difficult to have sick children. The manager would change the schedule when I had a day off and not notify me.
bad,"Production management is running the place into the ground. If you're applying for production be prepared to work 55-65 hour weeks and frequent mandatory Saturdays. You will never see your “leaders” working these Saturdays."
bad,"Management was a joke, plant manager was never around. Union took way too much money from my checks for about 4 months and the Union Steward wasn’t any help in getting my money back all he does is complain non stop about EVERYTHING while helping no one. I was also ridiculed constantly by the guy who trained me for a medical condition in eyes that I’ve had since birth. Overall worst work experience I’ve ever had."
bad,"In the beginning LOL didn't make any waves...but as soon as they got full control of this business things really began to change. The main office (Minnesota) began to pass down their herrassment of employees. For the past 15/20 years I've seen things that should not have happend to good people employed here. Employees attitudes started to change. I told my supervisor that when you lose the good hard dedicated ones its not long after that when the doors will close. This was a great place to work. But whoever is in charge in Minnesota has not heart, no soul and does not care about the workers at this facilitie."
bad,"Stay away from this one!! Low pay for what they expect, not enough maintenance people on a shift to do job, very unsafe workplace and safety culture, a lot of drama."
bad,"No advancement opportunities, co-workers and managers lack relevant and/or college education.  Lack real corporate experience. Management micromanages too often and will not relinquish control of the technological platform collectively to the team.  Management also does not take ownership to work the problem if issues develop from lack of proper funding of associated technology.  Implemented 3 strikes rule (and your out) to change management process which indicates a discriminatory practice resides with IT management from top to bottom.  HR refused to address this policy and team surveys do nothing to address the issues within Management.  Overall there is a real problem with leadership."
bad,"Majority of management is more concerned about nothing but the numbers, regardless of the workers and the level of effort they put into it. Many of the jobs here are completely overwhelming due to the fact they combined multiple previous jobs into 1 new job. "
bad,"Rules are not consistent"
bad,"No advancement opportunities, co-workers and managers lack relevant and/or college education. Lack real corporate experience. Management micromanages too often and will not relinquish control of the credit and financial customer services to the team. Management also does not take ownership to work the problem if issues develop from lack of proper funding. Implemented 3 strikes rule (and your out) to change management process which indicates a discriminatory practice resides with Financial management from top to bottom. HR refused to address this policy and team surveys do nothing to address the issues within Management. Overall there is a real problem with leadership. "
bad,I worked there for two weeks and got in a minor forklift accident my supervisor suspended me told me i would be able to come back in two days four days later i was informed that i was being terminated good luck applying better know how to speak spanish because everybody theirs spanish and cant properly train English employees
bad,"I would advise everyone looking for a job in Davis to look for work elsewhere. The work is priority, not the employee. Backstabbing everywhere you turn. They don’t even allow you to be off Sundays. Guys are treated like work horses."
bad,"Senior management very antagonistic towards people not in their clique.  Doing a great job doesn't mean you will be around.  As companies are bought up and merged, doesn't matter how great you are, if they want you out, you are gone.  Reminds me of cliques in high school.  Company asks you to be tolerant, but if you aren't a minority, then better keep your head down and mouth shut.  Very discouraging after having a great career most of my life."
bad,Pay was adequate. Hours were aweful. Work 12-16 hours with 8 off before another 12-16 hour shift. Treated employees with disdain and zero regard for family life. Tension high always between supervisors and employees. Union has been infiltrated by management.
bad,"a typical day at work was an 8 hour shift starting at 4 am"
bad,"Uninvolved management, taskmasters, and aloof personnel.  The turnover is significant and the working conditions are substandard--moldy tiles, odorous, uneven heat distribution.  "
bad,"I worked for this company less than a year in a management position.  It was probably the worst experience of my career.   Little to no training and unclear expectations created friction with the facility manager.  Continual bad mouthing of previous employees, and an atmosphere of favoritism, led to high anxiety and hostility within the station.  Competition and infighting between the alfalfa and corn managers was a source of unrest almost daily.   "
bad,This job is for people who lack the ability to strive for anything other than just a paycheck. Not intellectually stimulating and hours are long. If you like only being told what to do anot got going anywhere in life than Land o Lakes certainly will do.
bad,"Production work milk and butter, management not behind it's employees', co-workers are great, Company always trying to find ways to fire people instead of helping them."
bad,"Work five to seven days a week year round. Give years of life to the place and they will get rid of you with no remorse at all. Always looking to cut people and at the cost of adding more work to employees that are already working at full capacity. Don't ever trust the human resource department at this location because they are against you in every way. Employees fill out surveys yearly with much emphasis on how horrible the place has become but the surveys go unanswered. Very poor management who would rather get rid of you then to help you. Don't expect to get full time hours for several years if newly hired. You will be scheduled all shifts every week with many third, second, and first shift rotations the same week that take there toll on your well being and family life."
bad,"Even though they are union, they do not honor seniority. They place several people on temporary lay off or standby and then they hire off the street, new people, training on jobs the people on temporary layoff are not allowed to train on. The people on standby are ""chosen"" based on their ""position"" in the company for available training or actual work. For example, one guy's brother is a unit manager, therefore, and for that reason, he is almost never on standby, even though he is at the bottom of the seniority pole in the Teamsters local.. The women hired there recently, who have not yet been senior enough to get a bid job are passed over for training and/or work, left to rot on standby and unemployment. This place reeks of discrimination. Even though you are on standby, you are not laid off. The company pays your medical insurance, for example, the same as they do for the people working 40 hours a week on a ""real"" job. You are not compensated for your standby hours which are approximately 3 am. to 7 am. and 11 am. to 1 pm. and 7pm. to 9 pm. This is your combined standby, Monday thru Friday. It's impossible to have another job to try to support yourself and your family."
bad,Employees and management at the Portland OR office have no discretion and tact.
bad,Very poorly organized and managed building. High turn over due to poor management. The benefits were good although not enough vacation in my opinion. Wages are not very competitive.
bad,Poor management. Very cut throat and the management lacks leadership and organizational behavior. Ended my temp services after having death in the family. Lack of compassion. Certain managers tend to pick on employees.
bad,Well were to start. First it was a laid back maintenance  tech/ maintenance manger position.  So I was pretty  excited about it.  The manger failed to  tell me about some of the things I would have to do. I have no problem  going  in confined  space  but with the right equipment. And safety  that was no concern  for the 2 guy cranking me up and down.  Wow nightmare.
bad,"Inconsistent management, terrible amounts of overtime, long days, only good thing about the place is the pay and benefits. No work home balance and they couldn't care less as to how much you work."
bad,"Enjoyed working with customers to resolve issues reported."
bad,"My boss is selfish, prejudice,  liar, micro manager, and very unprofessional towards me. I'm the only colored guy in the team."
bad,"If you can tolerate hypocrisy, hostile work environment, overt racism, then this job is for you! Absolutely no consideration for hard work, personality contest."
bad,There is forced overtime . you do not know how many hours you will work from day to  day. There is no work life balance.Pay is good for the amount of work in the plant.
bad,"Work environment needed improvement, better direction. Management was lacking in understanding what was needed or wanted. Company /department needed improvement on process."
bad,"I was hired through a labor agency for the summer of 15 as a corn pollinator. It was a lot of field work and it was about 7 hour days 7 days a week. The money was good the job was easy but the organization was a joke. The ""crew leaders"" were anything but professional. Sometime we stood around waiting and got paid for it. It is good for a summer job."
bad,"Get all trucks loaded at all costs. Too many spoiled and unproductive workers in front office, production and warehouse. Lack of teamwork, communication, no management support for warehouse. Lazy workers on both shifts. Loading trucks with broken forklifts, working in extreme weather conditions without heating or air conditioning. The most enjoyable part of job was taking vacations, but not coming back to more work!!"
bad,Great job company pays well but keeps terrible people while pushing good workers away. Work to many hours days off change way to much to enjoy life away from work or at work
bad,"Fast-pace and stressful. Not the best job I have ever had, but not the worst job either. The pay is decent, but could be a lot better for the area I work in."
bad,"Management is not loyal to his Supervisors."
bad,"I would never, ever work for this company again! Management is second rate at best, work conditions are horrible, company morale is depressing!"
bad,You cannot work the shift scheduling they use and expect to have any kind of life. You rarely receive a full forty hour week. You will be on call all shifts during the week with no guarantee of 40 hours. If you are not called in during the week you can be expected to be called in Friday night third shift for sure messing up your unemployment and weekend. Human resource department has no respect for employees or what they sacrifice for them working their on call hours. Don't expect to have any kind of family or social life working here. Very poor human resource department.
bad,"Found favoritism, and unethical practices with regards to employees. Everyone cowered to a bully. Even management had his ear. The job itself I enjoyed, and the people (equals) were nice enough. Pay was pretty good. Tried to keep the place clean."
bad,"its hard work and not for just anyone you really need to be on your toes, a lot of management runs through this plant and high turn over on production"
bad,always understaffed always working short and long 12 hour days always short a supervisor or have a new one rotating door for the front office and plant managers as well.  and a point system that doesn't honor doctor excuses absences and will fire you if you do.
bad,great place to work.they have great benifits and its fast pace and long hours. If you like learning and motivated. the people are friendly and will help if you need help
bad,"I worked pollinating corn for 1 summer and made decent money. The job itself was easy but it was mandatory to work everyday. Some days we came in for only a couple of hours..seems like a waste of time when we were told to reserve a full day. It was outdoor work all day long, we're not allowed inside the buildings and had portable bathrooms but no hand wash station. My food spoiled a couple of times from the heat. "
bad,Good place to work if you can get past the point if the management doesnt want employees around from businesses they bought. they will target them and slowly fire them
bad,"In the 8 months that I was there, I spoke to my supervisor ONCE! And that was because the tech. lead that I worked with didn't feel that I spoke to him with respect when I asked him about technical requirements. The managers that are the decision makers are not available. Both teams that I was a part of suffered immensely from this organization not having a clear direction from either the product owners or the managing directors. From what I could tell, there are a lot of people there that can talk the talk, but cannot actually walk the walk, which is unfortunate, as it really is a great company."
bad,Works for some positions and not for others.  Very difficult to get materials to do certain jobs and can be a very noisy and distracting environment.  Also takes much more effort to keep confidential information protected and secure.  A little like being in college with having to carry a backpack everywhere you go with all your work materials and equipment.
bad,"Terrific purpose - feeding human progress"
bad,"Some jobs are more difficult than others. The pay and benefits are very very good. But a great majority of the workers are more concerned about drama than they are about the job that they are supposed to be doing. Also, management could be a lot better than it currently is. Not very understanding of needing a last minute day off when there is a medical emergency."
bad,"Full of baby boomers stuck in their old ways. Poor management, with politics being the only way to advance or move to a different position. Upper management is concerning due to lack of knowledge and people skills."
bad,"i really liked my past position. great opportunities! it's disheartening when the plant manager asks you to buy their product because they are in the deficit. there is so much potential but no serious money is invested in the business. when you have leaking ceiling tiles everywhere, it leaves an impression. way too much drama and back stabbing and management refuses to deal with it. again... the building has potential and the benefits and pay are top notch!! but the schedule, ot, and drama make it not worth it."
bad,I worked as a contractor for Land O Lakes. A position opened up on the team I was helping. I then had to train the new hire how to do my job knowing that I had only 3-4 weeks left on my contract.
bad,Stressful place to work people slack off always having to pick up slack because other employees talk and mess around but nothing happens because people are buddys with bosses
bad,Come in pack chips in boxes at fast pace and stack on pallet very good pay
bad,Our work areas were constantly working in a dusty dirty lung toxic air. We had to work a month straight with the dust collectors getting working on so everything floated through the air. Must have been able to lift 50lbs and there were people there that couldn't and slowed the entire process down and everyone's pay would be on the low.
good,With the new building they went to an open floor plan and that means you don’t have a desk. You take a work station everyday and it is very noisy. If you miss the feel of a college campus this is the place for you.
good,"Expectation is that you work 10 plus hours a day. I learned that one bad facility does not define the company as a whole. The hardest part of the job was management. I went through 2 plant managers, 4 operation managers and constant turn over of fellow supervisors. The best part of the job was the shift schedule and hourly employees."
good,"Typical day at work is stress filled.  Co-workers made most days bearable.  There seems to be a lack of communication in Management. Decent pay for the area that its located in, however not enough to cover the stress of the job."
good,Worked long hours with 8 hours off between shifts at times. management never took the time to learn how things are made. lot of stress caused by management.
good,LOL is too bereaucratic and lacks resources and culture to be effective but is good with employees capacity building and compensation structures. extensive meeting requirements.
good,"Integrity in upper management at Melrose is lacking. If HR or the Managers don't like you, they will get you fired. Most Supervisors don't have any idea what they are doing and those that do start figuring things out are run out of the plant. Morale is low due to there not being any trust between the floor and management. As an example I recently lost a Supervisor who was the best we had seen in years because he was honest about a mistake he made. The company has no integrity left."
good,"Divisional leadership is great. Unfortunately, that is not the case with all mid-level managers. The company espouses a people and performance ethic, but whether there is any ""people"" focus to go along with the ""performance"" piece very much depends on for whom you work. "
good,"Company is going through significant pressure and change which bleeds down to employees of the organization.  Desire to make positive change is challenging, and ultimately there is strong cultural resistance to make bold decisions."
good,there was not very good training involved with the position.  you were just seated at a desk and computer and had to follow hand outs.  the staff was not very available for questions or training.
good,"I worked here for years before Land O Lakes took over, it went downhill steadily. Poor leadership, played employee favoritism, no team atmosphere, unsafe environment."
good,I would not recommend working there if you have allergies.  The place is full of corn dust.  The Administrative Assistant is a major controlling person and talks to you like you are dirt.  While I was working there the other office person quit because she couldn't work with the other Administrative Assistant.  She was so mean to her.
good,"Good company to get your career started.  Unfortunately, there is little to no advancement once you are employed.  If you're looking for a comfortable place to work, with great benefits - this is it.  If you are looking for a company that wants to see its employees grow and take on bigger roles, this is not the company for you."
good,Very young management team. All about production not quality and people's interest. No support no supervision. Very dusty environment old equipment. Good benefits
good,"Ok Company, was trying to figure out who they wanted to be and was top heavy on management. Dominant player in the Animal Feed business. Decision making seem to be slow."
good,"Very Professional place, A lot of trainings is involved but they do not give you the time to practice before a new regulation is applyed. They are going from training to real life application too fast. The work ambiance could be improved. You do not get any feedback on your job. The Company is also very slow to replace a sick employee, witch put the burden on the other employees, sacrificing their safety work conditions"
good,The company has great work life balance.  Most managers are careful to not create undue burdens on staff members.  The new open office space is distracting and causing people to have to work more because of all the distractions that occur.
good,"12+ hour days"
good,"This was a great place to work once upon a time. Things are changing and the changes no longer include employee morale. The changes we were told by management are for the betterment of the company, not the betterment of the employees. Now the employees are jumping ship for the betterment of themselves."
good,All in all a good place to work. Land O'Lakes really cares about their commitment to the community and their purpose (Feeding Human Progress). Good place but not what it used to be!
good,Manufacturing plant that compensates well but has a poor schedule. Some rough working conditions. Low management/supervisory visibility. Few options for advancement.
good,Very fast pace mill. Unit mill with a lot of good and hard workers. Management is young and has room for improvement. The deadline margin is small for any errors. Couple hours of downtime and could be working weekends a lot.
good,It is a easy place to work scheduling is cool the benefits are great and the vacation you get is unreal. Down side is the management their is lacking any real direction and understanding of processes. They also have a high turn over rate in management which sure doesn't help.
good,I've worked as a contract employee at LOL for 6 months. I switched departments 4 months in to help when another contractor was let go. A permanent position became available in the department that I worked for 2 months. I got the interviews and felt really confident about getting it. They denied me the position because I lack experience. They are now bringing on a completely new employee (we assume - since management won't share anything about who they are other than whispered rumors we hear) that will need to be trained from scratch.
good,Production for 12- or more hours often
good,"So many rules to follow like time of punch in, being late, being too early, all towards a point system for the year before they wipe your slate clean again. Hours may fluctuate depending on position and culture segregated.  Takes a toll on your job/work life. Money is good, lot of overtime but not a regular 9-5 job no matter what shift you take or be placed at. I worked for as long as i could before it started taking a toll on my life and relationship with my fiancee which eventually lead to my resignation."
good,Management is out to screw ya cuz the place is union driven place. They expect another employee to train you thats not a trainer doesnt like to train cuz of how management treats tje trainee.. Always ripping you off what your supposed to be traini g on to do things  that can wait
good,"The office has an open environment, no assigned location for an employee.  It does have a gym, daycare provider and bank onsite at the Corporate office"
good,"Land O'Lakes mission is great, there are a lot of people working toward the good of all farmers."
good,"great place to work if your young and don't mind long hours.  we had some great sup. when we inquired a new gen. manager , a lot the good ones got let go"
good,"Understanding that the Ag industry is up and down - there seems to be an unusual amount of downtime here. The I.T. department is too compartmentalized to get anything done efficiently. The entire company as a whole is about a decade behind in technology."
good,"Good place to work.  Good culture.    Ability to learn through different roles.   Management is good, but up to employee to drive career and seek out new roles."
good,"Land O' Lakes is a successful market- and customer-driven cooperative committed to optimizing the value of our members' dairy, crop and livestock production."
good,"If you like heavy labor in a dusty production setting, this is it."
good,"we were constantly on the move with no down time and some days we were forced to stay up to 6 extra hours, made it hard to maintain a regular life"
good,no advancement. contract workers just keep getting replaced.
good,"You'll see your fellow employees more than your family. Pay is good though. Union, has its pros and cons. Could have better management. Always deadlines!"
good,Be prepared to do a lot of walking and climbing. Very hot work. Bring extra clothes. There is a swing shift when you first start. There are rules with it though.
good,"LOL is a little different since it's a cooperative and not a stock company. Their responsibility is to their producer and coop ownership.  That means that your customers are the owners so there is a very intimate relationship, nothing distant about it. The recent struggling agricultural economy has caused a lot of changes."
good,"I love working here and have never been at a better company. My boss and leadership team are exceptionally supportive, flexible and I’m rewarded fairly and often. We truly care about our customers and their success and we are given freedom and encouraged to deliver the best experience possible to them"
good,"I Was fine working there until new management came in and made it a hostile place to work. It pitted day crew against night crew, it pitted operators against Maintenance men"
good,New progressive office that allows flexibility. Good work life balance but managers are not engaging. Would like to have seen more opportunities for professional growth.
good,"This review is for a factory job in a factory that no longer exists.  Land O'Lakes had a bunch of tiny factories all over the place, and had to consolidate due to pressure from market forces"
good,great working with people and animals. well paced job and relaxing. got to learn new things and activities you learned threw out the day.would deff recommend it to anyone.
good,I worked the night shift so there was not much interaction with the company as a whole. Enjoyed the time there and the company treated everyone fair.   The hours were 12 hour shifts 5 days a week
good,"It was too long ago to recall enough details to give a fair rating, but indeed is making this review required so I will rate them 3 stars.  For  most things they were pretty good."
good,Land O'Lakes is a terrific company with great work life balance.  It's company purpose is very motivating and it makes working there bearable given the limited advancement opportunities.
good,"Co-op company owned by farmers. Three divisions, advancement is available in all areas. Connections matter here and each location has a different culture."
good,"stacking skids,learned about butter, management didn't really know ,co workers were nice, 12 hr days 4 20 min. breaks ,going home it was all work no play everyone had their own job and stayed busy meeting new people had no pool table,ping pong table,i was only there month family issues"
good,The company has a strong age bias; younger workers are given more opportunities for training and advancement.  The age demographics of the Land O'Lakes workforce do not match the age demographics of the Twin Cities area.
good,"The location is the largest milk processing plant in the East Coast."
good,"Responsible for maintaining relations, answering phone, taking feed orders, training office coordinator to use computerized Batching System Program to make feed, sorting and delivering mail, and setting-up a breakdown system for scheduling feed output to communicate with production managers.Responsible for maintaining inventory levels – ordering and updating perpetual levels in the computerized batching system, system on Lotus 1-2-3 graphs and spread sheets in both Lotus and Excel."
good,"worked at a branch office, very small location. Can't give much a review on this. I enjoyed it fine. Do not want to write this review."
good,"Working at a cheese factory is not for someone who wants to work at their own pace. You move as fast as the machines move, and if you don't keep up they don't stop for you. Same thing goes for when you are doing sanitation, you have to be on top of your cleaning cycles otherwise you won't have all the machines clean for production and that is frowned upon immensely."
good,fun and productive place to work and the people was fun and easy to be around
good,Rush from meeting to meeting.  Manufacturing facilities micromanaged by corporate leaders.
good,I enjoy working in the manufacturing industry.I am just looking for 8 hour shifts now.I am a fast learner and work well with others as  well as  working on my own.In my spare time I do photography.It is a passion of mine.
good,"I've worked for two other large companies in the Ag and Food Industry in my career, and I enjoy the company culture at Land O'Lakes the best.  I'm allowed to leverage my passions in the work that I do, which is a true blessing.  The company is honest about where they want to go in the future and about the realities we face each day while we try to get there.  It's not always easy, but I feel like I have the support I need to succeed."
good,"The people (co-workers) are really great."
good,"My experience with this company was limited in nature, being employed by a subcontractor with funding from Land O-Lakes.  However, through interactions with their Mindanao Program representative, I was impressed with how said representative coordinated with the different stakeholders involved in the program at the same time acknowledging the expertise of the  subcontractor research team members."
good,"Great Admin job, learned a lot about IT.  "
good,"My co-workers were great to work with. I picked up extensive knowledge in Oralce PL/SQL programming. The management was ok. They had a lot of systems on different platforms and versions, that made it difficult to exchange information between the systems."
good,"Land O'Lakes Inc had a clear mission and values; however, it was not enforced in the portion of the company that I worked in.  I worked for a very small group with many cliques that I just didn't fit into.  Overall, the benefits were great and flexible, but I think my specific group was poorly managed and lacked organizational structure."
good,"Land O'Lakes, Inc. is currently (2019) going through numerous transitions and employees can feel the tension of cultural shifts within the workplace, because things have not settled quite yet. This feeling of uncertainty is difficult for me, because I am not sure where or if I have a place in the company OR if I will like the culture once everything has settled. I appreciate that Land O'Lakes offers a good amount of paid time off, ""summer hour"" half-day Fridays during the summer, and a ""Dress for Your Day"" dress code. This reflects an understanding that employees are whole individuals, not just workers. However, at the same time, I do not feel like I have opportunities for development nor growth - and can sometimes feel like a cog in a much bigger wheel. Working for a cooperative is a major asset though, because that wheel (in which I am a cog) is not only about making money, but also about making a difference for farmers, agriculture, and the world. I feel like working for a Fortune 200 cooperative has all the benefits of a massive corporation, but doesn't come with the guilt of selling out to big money."
good,"Land O'Lakes values their employees and ensures that they have a balanced work/life environment.  They also offer competitive salary, flexibility, and benefits."
good,I am continually learning new things in the course of my work and love that I have the opportunity to take on new challenges and figure things out.  I have amazing co-workers and really enjoy working with them.  The people and the culture are part of what makes Land O'Lakes great!
good,"There is a common theme of longevity within the company, from the first day on it is noticeable that individuals tend to stay with the company. There is a good visibility of Presidents/ Vice Presidents within the divisions, but not with CEO, COO, ect."
good,"Growing up in a small town in rural Wisconsin, Land O'Lakes quickly felt like home to me. The small town community feeling where your co-workers have your back, you can strike up a conversation with anyone, and we all feel like we're working towards a common goal - all reminded me of my small town. After 8 years, I'm still proud to call this company 'home.'"
good,"Processes were not effective and therefore getting projects done was difficult and frustrating. I need to work smarter and not harder. Pay as not very good, but they generously contributed towards my retirement and health care."
good,"Ben put in intervention 3 times for braking hard. Last one was at a gas pump. Few issues with that but other than the privacy issue with camera, great job. Not very many hours of overtime in the winter months but great in spring summer and fall. So far....."
good,No chance to get hired as being a contract worker as they are letting their full time staff go. Sometimes I think I'm safter being a contract worker. The pay is poor.
good,Can't give much since I'm a temp and they don't include temps in any work picnics or anything else since we are not employees.  Pretty laid back as pond long as you get your work done.
good,The people were generous in transferring their knowledge. Management's bottom line approach failed to resolve long-term issues.  Rotation program not offered to all.
good,"Land O Lakes was a good employer, the area was just not for me. I was relocated to another area and enjoyed my time spent there but found through time it was not the right fit for me."
good,"All new management in R&D was terrible.   They do not have any ""game plan"", only try to please their manager - this does not allow for a cohesive strategy ... though other than their personal career, I do not think they care."
good,"An important part of considering working at Land O’Lakes is to realize that it is more than just the Land O’Lakes that you think of with butter."
good,"Working for Land O'Lakes corporate as a contractor, you obviously do not get the full benefits of being a full timer. It can sometimes get as bad as employees treating you differently just because the realized you're a contractor."
good,"Land O'Lakes is a good place to work.  Most of the people are great to work with and I've had solid work experiences thus far.  The culture can be a bit slow paced, especially when it comes to decision making."
good,"Land O'Lakes is a thoroughly interesting company. I never thought I would in the agriculture business, but I'm glad I landed here. They brand themselves as ""farm-to-fork,"" and it's a true assessment of their business.  It's not just butter. This company is food production from beginning to end. It includes seed (WinField United), feed (Purina Animal Nutrition), dairy (butter, spreads), and a global nonprofit. It's a Fortune 500 company that feels like a small company."
good,A decent company that needs to move faster and build a better office to attract top talent. Hours are great and summer fridays are a nice touch. But old world mentality made it a difficult workplace for me.
good,Friendly staff very professional brakes every 2 hours and lunch are on time provide you all the personal protected equipment provide water shade and portable bathrooms on every field
good,"A very well run facility that has passionate employees.  Managers were friendly and off site everyone was like family.  A large facility with different businesses, it was challenging and a great learning experience for me."
good,It was a nice place to work. We were an awesome team. Casual dress code which made it very comfortable. Very stressful at times.
good,"Work started at 8am-5pm, great opportunity to gain laboratory experience for a undergraduate. fun working environment."
good,Corporate headquarter location is a great place to work. Other locations can be different. Opportunity for growth can be dependent on which department you work in.
good,"As a recruiter, I've had the opportunity to work with many excellent hiring managers who care about talent and developing talent. Managers are approachable and dedicated to bringing in top talent and working closely with me as their Talent Acquisition Partner to achieve that goal. Also, I'm challenged with projects that stretch me and keep me thinking about innovation."
good,"Great work environment and culture. Positive atmosphere. Best part is the team members, great group to work with. Has a family feel, company is large, but headquarters is small."
good,"I really like my colleagues, the team atmosphere, and new workspace across HQ that allows me to work close to my group or separately if I need to focus or just need a change of pace."
good,"There is an extreme divide between what the workers want and want management wants workers to do. This is one of the main reasons it is very hard for the company to retain employees. This is even with great pay and benefits. Also, if you are new it is almost a given that you will be working every weekend and holiday."
good,I enjoyed working at Land O' Lakes because it was a fast pace environment and we had to move quickly because we were constantly very busy and I got to meet some very nice people.
good,"My manager and department was great to work with but if you don't have a degree or are an internal candidate its hard to move up.  Recruiting doesn't value existing talent and often looks over qualified candidates.  Benefits good, pay is competitive for similar positions."
good,Working at Land O Lakes I learned that is can be tough to find the resources necessary to complete my job. The organization of the company needs work since there are multiple copies of files and no one knows which is the correct one to use.
good,"The company as a whole is run very well. However, in New York they decided to move the distribution part of the operation to another state due to cost."
good,was able to go from operator to 2nd shift supervisor in less than 3 years
good,"pay and benefits are remarkable!! great job! cannot find a job this good very easily. if you have it, take care of it!!"
good,"Even though the diversity and inclusion seems to be over funded, Land O Lakes is a nice place to work.  The pay and benefits competes with other companies in the area, and they are willing to consider requests for special accommodations."
good,"24 hour operation. "
good,"I worked at Land O'Lakes as a contractor converting all of their computers to windows 7 from XP. "
good,"Good company to work for.  They went through some culture changes after I left, and i understand it is an even better place to work. "
good,"Hard to advance without experience in other fields or companies.  Good people often overlooked if you aren't working at corporate.  Adding new facilities at corporate and continues to be a profitable company, growing each year."
good,"A busy environment with hard working employees. Hardest thing is to know everything. People are great to interacted with and even hanging out outside of work. Strong culture that started off by local Dairy men. I have learned safety skills, employee development, and leader ship skills."
good,Land O Lakes as a whole is a great company to work for. However the office in New York was run with terrible management. Terrific product line.
good,"Lots of room for advancement, flexible working schedule, managers that generally really care. Good leadership.They have a great company culture, offer good compensation and benefits, and have amazing career opportunities available. All around good."
good,I really enjoyed the people that I worked with.  I just could not handle management not dealing with frustrations within the office.
good,"I learned much about FIFO, forecasting, logistics, material replentishment and freight negotiation."
good,I processed invoices within the various programs at Land O Lakes and I got to know the ins and outs of their software.  Management was laid back and i was able to do my work without having to be checked on or interrupted.  The other people in the office were all very helpful and willing to teach me how to do my job.  The hardest part was the repetition but the best part of the job was that i was able to do my job well with out being supervised.
good,"The project work I did was very fulfilling, especially our most recent launch of our all new, secure members website. Learned how to maintain websites, databases & electronic filing systems."
good,high work volume and too few people in my department overall not a bad place if you can get in
good,"I have been with the company for a long time, I have nothing bad to say.  I work remotely which limits my ability to advance within this company.  Hardest part is being remote, and may not get included in communications."
good,"A unique job,gotta wanna work or this isn't the place 4 u.no stress,just do your work n go home,on night shift..pretty good mgmt, very physical job but not hard. Temp,is hot in summer cold on socks but overall not bad"
good,"The people at Land O'Lakes are what make it a great place to work. Everyone seems to have good friends at work that they trust and enjoy working with. The new office is great, along with the perks like the health clinic and gym. There is some uncertainty right now with the direction of the company due to industry changes and a new CEO, so there seems to be some unrest and worry among the company, so we're all hoping Beth and the leadership team can help change inspire innovation and get things turned around."
good,"Land O'Lakes Inc. is a large enterprise and each team or business unit has their own work culture. Those working in international business or international development have much earlier start times due to time zone differences between our various offices around the globe. International trips are, on average, two weeks long so those with families do have to do more to balance their personal schedules and make that happen. Overall, it's a highly engaging place to work with a pay-for-performance culture that ensures those who work hard and bring good ideas to the table are compensated in line with market."
good,"I love working for Land O'Lakes because of the culture that exists being a large food cooperative, rather than a publicly traded company. This brings a culture of camaraderie and cooperation even as an employee. As employees I think we understand that our bosses are our farmers, the ones who make it all possible by feeding the world. Employees appreciate that we also do good work with our local foundation and through our international development efforts overseas, which are helping to bring better opportunities to those farmers."
good,"I started my career out in the manufacturing plants, and progressively took on new assignments and roles, being promoted to our corporate headquarters.  At headquarters we have a really nice fitness center, onsite medical center, onsite child care and a really great cafeteria and company store.  My boss is pretty great about allowing me to work from my home during days of snow or bad weather, so that has really helped with my work life balance.  We have an open work environment which can be fun, but also challenging because you don't have a consistent desk to go to everyday.  The best part of the job is knowing that I'm working for a Farmer Owned Cooperative."
good,"So much going on - lots of energy in dynamic, challenging, industries, all of which have a broad reach - and knowing that you can too in your role is energizing."
good,"Land O'Lakes is a member owned cooperative.  From farmer to fork, Land O'Lakes works with our member owners to help educate the general public about the important role of agriculture in our economy while providing high quality, value added products and services.  The four businesses within Land O'Lakes (Dairy, Purina Animal Nutrition, Winfield United and Sustain) provide us a unique viewpoint and insights into the agricultural industry.  We work together across these businesses and departments to ensure we are making the best decisions for our member owners while providing our employees with growth opportunites."
good,"LOL is a great place to work. I would recommend. I like the environment and the changes that are being made within the company. With a new CEO, things are bound to get better."
good,very laid back atmosphere as long as you stayed on task and got the work done. i enjoyed my work and felt very accomplished leaving every day. Many people retire with the company because of great benefits and culture.
good,"Provided great culture to try new tactics.  Although a conservative company, they strive to adjust to new work environments and provide good benefits to those that work at the campus."
good,Great friedly people willing to train you. Very helpful hard to manage the long hours with kids.
good,"New hires can expect to bounce around shifts, and depending on the department, a fair amount of overtime."
good,A good solid company to work for. Pay and benefits are competitive with the market. Not a lot of opportunity for advancement within the company and some groups have tight circles.
good,"Land O Lakes was a great company to work for with great benefits such as Vision, Health Union Retirement Pension I probably would have retired from there if it wouldve stayed open."
good,"this was a temporary job so there is not a lot of things I can add, the people were a lot of fun to be around and the atmosphere was enjoyable to walk into everyday"
good,While employed here I learned a lot about the farming community around texas. the pay was good and always enjoyed the people i worked with.
good,"Land O'Lakes has a great culture of giving to the community and of high ethics.  The management walks the talk - you can really trust them.  They have really grown in diversity in the past several years and have expanded on their benefits - like free coffee and summer hours.  "
good,"Land O'Lakes views and values employees time at and away from the office with consideration and respect. They facilitate an open and creative environment and encourage employees to collaborate together. Within five years I have been promoted three times. They encourage cross-functional movement and development. Employees of Land O'Lakes are professional, intelligent and respected. I have had opportunity to travel to thirteen of the Feed plant locations nationwide and assist in implementing an advanced call center for the Feed Customer Service org. I have learned a lot and growth immensely in my career."
good,Fast paced feed manufacturing plant several different job titles throughout the facility. There was a good foundation of workers all involved with the daily process.
good,Benefits of working here are medical dental and vision. Life insurance. 401 k. Stocks bonds. Great place to advance. Also lots of locations to relocate to if your wanting to travel.
good,A very good place to work at.  Fast paced and always busy.  The pay was nice and the employees are always easy to work with or ask questions.  I had a nice time there.
good,I love working at Land O'Lakes.  Its meaningful work with a great group of people.  I find that the culture is smart and relaxed at the same time -- a rare find these days.
good,Many development opportunities available! Flexible work environment. Frequent opportunities to network with other departments and business units. Encouraged to learn cross function roles and business.
good,The work is challenging and rewarding and I'm excited to see how this organization impacts the world around us. The people are what make this company great and why I hope to have many more years here.
good,"Land O'Lakes is a great company! I've enjoyed working with each of my supervisors, and learned something from each of them. There are challenges, some of them self-imposed, but there are also great opportunities. The next few years will be critical in determining whether Land O'Lakes can set itself apart from other companies, embrace innovation and fully leverage its engaged employee base, or if it will try to hold on to unnecessary tradition, stifle creativity, and slowly fade. It's exciting to be a part of this moment."
good,"I have been with Land O'Lakes for almost 20 years.  I never thought I would be with an organization this long, but I stay because of the purpose we serve for farmers and the great people I get a chance to work with everyday."
good,"great people, farmer owned co-op culture transcends into company culture.  lots of common sense problem solving, incredible work ethic, and good collaboration between leaders.  Able to mentor from Director and still value those lessons learned which impact my decisions still today."
good,"I loved my teammates and really enjoyed the work with them. I struggled with the species team's at Purina because they are very competitive and do not cooperate for the benefit of the company. Instead, they are very concerned with promoting their own image. This made for a lot of disconnected teams, that didn't have shared benefits/learnings, which resulted in a huge loss of potential."
good,Land O'Lakes has a new open work environment promoting collaborative work between employees and teams.  Discounts on butter and other Land O'Lakes products is a great bonus.
good,Land O'Lakes was a great place to work and still is I'm just looking for day work it works better with my family and activities I am fine Land O Lakes to work with me very well except for the fact that I need the Day hours
good,"Good work environment, good job security. Good benifits and discounts. Overtime and Holiday pay is good. Its a Union plant, so alot more job security overall. HR is really good at helping fix any problems or needs you may have. Really good communication between Supervisors and the Employees."
good,Good place to work. A lot of opportunity for growth.  Home office is in Minneapolis so relocation may be required.  Remote opportunities exist if you're willing to travel
good,"enjoyed 16 years with Land O'Lakes until being down sized out of IT. "
good,When I first started you stayed till the job was done so the shift wouldn't be left with it.When you have one senior man by his self it's lot for one person.Then your to leave it for him and get off their clock or try to write you up.
good,Unloadig trucks and loading trucks keeping up with lot codes and inventory maintaining a clean work space and making sure eveyone had palletts to stack feed on..
good,"Very good people and culture. Land O'Lakes does its best to ensure that we have the best environment for productivity, creativity, collaboration, and flexibility."
good,Different business model with co-op but a great company with excellent benefits. I enjoyed interactions with farmer owners and corporate office.
good,I'm working as a contractor for now. Everyone is very friendly and they are great at training. The work isn't difficult but they say it will get busier which makes it harder.
good,"start 11 pm and relief second shift operator, get the shift pass down from supervisor and job for that shift. i learned how run numerous types of machinery in the food and creamery industry. had good and bad co-workers. hardest part was working with employees that were lazy and didn't care about the job task were performing on any given night. the best part of the job was learning alot of different jobs..i like to learn new things"
good,Great place to work if u dont mind standing for hours at a time. pays very well and has great benefits. I enjoyed working here with nice coworkers and managers.
good,"At Land O'Lakes, I feel I have the opportunity to do important work every day. Work that contributes to my success and the Company's success. I feel challenged and valued."
good,"The best part of the job... it's the people!  I work among some of the most talented people.  Some of have been here for many years and some, not as long.  This mixture of tenure creates a great environment for development and growth."
good,"Land O'Lakes is a wonderful place to work.  There are many amenities at HQ that support work / life balance such as an onsite fitness and health center, as well as a day care.  The culture is very inclusive and supportive of employees.  The work environment allows for collaboration and flexibility in the work space.  You can find the best spot to support your working needs each day."
good,"I really enjoy working and Land O'Lakes.  When people ask me why, I reply that it is because I feel valued.  When I bring ideas of what we could do at Land O'Lakes people listen and help me work to create the vision - while adding their input as well.  Our collaborative culture allows us to share our viewpoints while also receiving guidance from upper management.  We are a company who gets by with as little resources as possible. Our teams are small, but our tasks are big. This is both a downfall and challenge that I like at Land O'Lakes."
good,"The people here are wonderful, I have worked with individuals across levels and businesses and have been truly impressed by their genuineness.   We are a truly well-intentioned organization and people believe in what we stand for.  We do run “lean” so opportunity to grow your skill sets and gain experience is great.  Your role will rarely fit into a box.  Work/life balance is good, medical/dental benefits are good.  Excited to see other changes and updates as the organization continues to progress under Beth Ford’s leadership."
good,"Land O Lakes is a good place to work . The pay and benefits are good. The work place is clean and the work is not over exsseivly hard , meaning you will work but is not back breaking"
good,As a project manager on the continuous improvement team I was fortunate enough to be a part of the lean six sigma program implementation at Land O'Lakes. This gave me much needed experience and helped me excel at managing and completing projects. The management is great and really push you to reach for your goals.
good,"Great work life balance in the company with the culture that we have here. People are flexible with the time & hours of work and able to accommodate when you need to leave or start early. The culture here is also improving with more and more focus on diversity and inclusion, people are made to feel more welcome and able to express their opinion. "
good,"I feel that I have finally found my home and a family with Land O'Lakes. I have worked in many different environments but feel that none can compare to what LOL offers. Some examples that come to mind are; the respect LO has for their employees' work/life balance, providing such wonderful resources to enhance and support growth within LOL, walking down the halls at headquarters you see happy employees and the culture here is one of support, genuine teamwork and shared goals and that also speak volumes. Especially when you can say you are excited to come to work every day and know you are appreciated and your work makes a difference and is acknowledged."
good,"Good pay and benefits.  Plenty of opportunities to advance and learn new things.  Relatively strong job security and a good corporate culture.  Like any large organization, can be slow to change."
good,"Land O'Lakes culture is very welcoming, the work environment is open and accommodating to everyone's needs.  The company does a good job of ensuring the employees first day is good and the system are ready for them.  People are flexible and technology is in place to come into the office and work in a space that meets my needs or work from home if my day allows for that."
good,"Land O' Lakes is a great company with challenging/rewarding work, a great future trajectory, a solid culture and good work/life balance.  I would highly recommend this company."
good,"LOL is a decent company but things are slow because of the old world mentality. It's also not very diverse, mostly men in management roles. They need to evolve  with the times to continue to grow and to attract top talent.  I worked at LOL temporarily therefore, did not get full time benefits otherwise, they have great benefits and great people to work with."
good,The culture here was somewhat limited. I worked with many of the same people for extended times. The workday was fast - paced and engaging. You were never at a loss for activity and attention to detail was a must in any position.
good,"A typical day is start at 4am Milk truckers come in test the milk before it can be unloaded. Make sure that the milk is good, check the seals. Some management is fine, there;s one manager that does not like me at all. I got a long with most of my co-workers. You can not get a long with everybody. But you try very hard to. because you are with more then you are with your spouse.There was no hard part I really enjoyed my job."
good,"My day to day continues to vary which is what I love about my role. I feel appreciated at Land O' Lakes and have felt over my past 5 years that I have had some of the best managers. They continue to help me grow my career by connecting me with internal and external partners, giving me feedback both good and bad as well as just champion me in my personal and work life. I have enjoyed being able to work on my MBA full time and having flexibility when needed to focus my attention on my personal life."
good,Really had no problem getting my different assignment throughout the day on the rf scanner & driving my forklift picking orders.
good,"I would audit approx. 5000 employee expense reports in a month. I was originally hired to be telephone support and I was promoted to the finance department.  It was a busy, busy place and enjoyed working their.  I have to admit that I did not think it was that hard.  Although, when it came to the annual audit...it was nerve racking."

good,I worked here so long ago only remember how flexible they were with my schooling hours.
good,"•	Organized and directed the user acceptance testing of over 280 applications for Windows 8.1 Readiness Project"
good,Great place to work. Work/Life balance is good. People within the company are great. I have had the opportunity to work both in the field and at the corporate office. Have enjoyed both experiences. There is an excellent focus on employee growth and well being.
good,Everything is good here. It has new and innovative technologies integration which is a new learning
good,There are too many business within Land O'Lakes and it will help any professional to learn a lot from this company
good,I enjoyed working with everyone at Land O'Lakes as well as the office work. Management and the workers in the plant were all helpful when collaboration was needed and respectful otherwise.
good,"Eight hour work days most of the time. Advancement is slow, pay isn't all that great. It is a job for some not for all.  Hardest part of the job would be working in the heat and cold."
good,I had the best co-workers ever that really mad the day go by. Management sucked. They have had 4 plant managers is 5 years if that tells you anything. Its the managers that have been there for a while that run out all of the good workers.
good,Great company to work for. Some of the middle management is not good and micromanages. May drive me away soon unfortunately. Negotiate for more PTO if you get hired.
good,"Land o Lakes offers those who are seeking to further their education the opportunity to do so, with good tuition reimbursement and time allotted to study. Great benefits and they try to instill a good team concept."
good,"I loved working with the people there. My boss never took care of problem people. I liked what I did. I also did not care for the hours in the spring,"
good,"Land O'Lakes is a company that makes you feel at home, a company that truly cares about its people first by offering a great work-life balance and flexible work arrangements. LOL is a great company to work for and is really making an effort to stay competitive in the market place. I feel my team is rewarded fairly for our efforts and productivity does not go unnoticed."

I appreciate the accessibility of the leadership teams, and the companies passion for driving Ag of tomorrow. I worked with smart, dedicated employees who are here for the right the reason and strive to do the right thing for our customers and industry."

good,"Land O'Lakes is a great place to work. Mentors are willing to help you achieve your goals. Employee gym and onsite clinic. Cafeteria and company store."
good,I had an awesome experience at Land O' Lakes the people there were great! Pay was great and time of was great. Job taught me a lot about food production.
good,"A company that holds true to it's cooperative roots offering the best of both worlds (NGO and private company).  People are empathetic and very professional.  As a billion dollar company, it is still run by its members."
good,"During the first part of the contract I met with programmers and developers to learn the functionality of the custom software. Then I developed the training and documentation manuals.  Classes were scheduled and I provided the training."
good,"Note: I was not an employee of Land O' Lakes but rather I worked two longer-term contract jobs @ Land O' Lake in Kent, OH and enjoyed every minute."
good,A lot of overtime required. Laid off due to down sizing;otherwise a great company with great benefits. They take very good care of the work force. Training was well put together.
good,"I love my company and the people are top-notch. It's a difficult organization to get into, but once you're in, they prioritize internal hires (and encourage internal movement). It's great that there's so many functions you can explore all under one roof. However, our there's a lack of accountability from Leadership and we're slow to move, so we're constantly late to the game in innovation. I worry about the company's long-term future but in my four years with Land O'Lakes, I've enjoyed every minute of it!"
good,Land O'Lakes is a great company to work for and especially appreciate that we are a Member/Farmer owned Cooperative. I have also found the work-life balance to be better here than other companies I have worked for in the Twin Cities. Great people too who are always willing to help each other out to enable success of the organization.
good,"I believe that Land O'Lakes is working hard to continually create and embrace a culture where people feel seen, heard and respected, and that work has done them well. I am pleased to be part of an organization that challenges and builds from within, to serve their membership outside the walls, as best they can. Leadership has taken a stance of increasing transparency and facing challenges head-on, together. That is something that I can get behind and believe in."
good,"Land O'Lakes is an amazing company to work for. I feel pride each day working for a farmer owned cooperative. The culture is fantastic. We have an open work environment which allows us to work where we feel best. There are focus rooms, huddle areas and the entire campus is designed to stimulate team building and collaboration. I love being able to dress for my day. It a business casual environment but if jeans makes sense for my day I'm allowed to wear them! Leadership expectations are outlined and clear. Ideas that stress hard work and accountability are emphasized."
good,Love this company. Just didnt like the location I was at. They highly value their employees. They put time into training and letting you get to know the business and your peers.
good,"Great company to work for, with the exception of this last year, they did a lot of out sourcing.  A little behind the times but it was done."
good,"Land O'Lakes is a very happy place to work. The farmer-owned aspect has much to do with that. I had the privilege of meeting the farmer-owners and it was an absolute highlight of my time there. LOL takes good of its people on a daily basis and offers flexible work options to help you preserve work/life balance. It's a very values-driven company dedicated to ""Feeding Human Progress"". Their market leadership in B2B food/agriculture is where the company is strongest. They struggle a little with marketing fundamentals in retail and innovation, which is related to the reason I left the company. (I got recruited by another company that was stronger in these areas of interest to me, though leaving was hard because I really loved working at Land O'Lakes and was very happy). They are heavily invested in overly-commoditized products, which makes the boom and bust business cycles quite volatile. For marketers, LOL is the most advantageous place to work if you're looking for job security and work/life balance over rapid advancement/highly challenging work. I would go back to work there if the right opportunity presented itself, and I recommend it highly to others."
good,"Great company, excellent benefits and employees treatment. The salaries are very competitive and safety is the most important for them. A salary increases every year and a good bonus"
good,"Great union benefits , great retirement opportunity to work with people who have been here for 30+ years. Working with a perishable product, the job could be very demanding at times, that makes the time go fast."
good,"Everyone I worked with enjoyed their job. The hours were long and the work was hard, but, since I enjoy working, that was fine by me."
good,Internship had a lot of good perks and learning opportunities. The campus is under construction but when finished will have a very nice headquarters to work at.
good,Gained a lot of Customer Service techniques in this position. Dealt with a lot of upset customers.  Learned a lot of interesting tasks . Pay was not the best .But the information learned was invaluable.
good,"Loved my co workers, my trainer was Awesome...very knowledgeable and patient.  Company has a community garden and gives to the food shelves."
good,"I loved my job of Website Support.  I was able to talk to customers and build rapport with them on a daily basis."
good,"The schedule is set so you can plan your year if you like.  Holidays are paid in the week they are worked instead of at a later time.  Triple pay is work Holiday.  A lot of standing on concrete.  Uniforms and boots are supplied.  Once at plant, one can not leave until end of shift."
good,"Very open to flex hours, can work from home, lots of interaction with other departments and various locations.  I was able to manage my self as long as I was responsible for my work; I did not need anyone looking over my shoulder to get my work done.  My immediate supervisor was too busy with the workload assigned to her for her to be looking over my shoulder to ensure that I was performing my duties"
good,"I really enjoy working at Land O'Lakes, Inc. The environment at the corporate office is fantastic, so many great amenities and the building is open and bright (so many windows). Even better than that though, I'm on an awesome team. My manager is the best I've ever had - so supportive, knowledgeable, and grateful. Likewise, my manager's manager is also the best leader I've ever worked under. A true leader that asks how they can help you instead of insisting that you help them."
good,Great company to work for.  Collaborative environment where people are willing to help out.  In a great industry with new leadership.  Set up to be successful through new ideas and innovations.
good,If you like to work hard with people who value your skills this might be the place for you.  I've worked at Land O'Lakes for over 15 years and been given great advancement opportunities.  I've had the opportunity to work on cross-functional teams that have increased my understanding of the business and projects that have had an impact on the overall employee experience.
good,Many good years with many good people. Many overtime hours some voluntary and some not. A whole lot of rules to follow which is very important to the company that you follow.
good,"Overall a pleasant, professionally challenging place to work. Diversity is valued, work/life balance is fostered, and team-building is utilized for a cohesive, goal-oriented work environment"
good,I work typically 6 days a week 8 hours a day. Working here is for the type of person to show up everyday and just do their job. Not for slackers that's for sure. The compensation is amazingly high for my city and management is very easy to talk to. Very fast paced and physical but that's the type of job I like.
good,"One of the best jobs I've ever had. Typical day included compiling information for the daily weight charts in power point, filing, document control and flow charts. Management was easy to get along with and communicated well."
good,Great place to work. Opportunity for job advancement. Great benefits. Very well respected manager. If I were given the opportunity to work at land O' lakes again. I would probably say yes.
good,Great company with excellent training programs.  Great quality control.  Really cares about their customers. The division that I worked for was the most profitable division in the entire company.  My VP supervisor was promoted to President of Land O' Lakes.  The selected replacement was from within the company and well qualified. Unfortunately he had a serious stroke and never recovered.  The company went outside and hired a replacement who destroyed our division making extreme changes.  He was fired and several people including me left the company.
good,"I feel like my skill set @ being an Administrative Assistant grew exponentially during my time @ LOL. The people who make-up the company were a joy to be around, I always look forward to going into each work day!"
good,"As a Marketer at Land O'Lakes, I have found it to be a collaborative and supportive work environment, with opportunities to develop across roles in its multiple business units.  With a new headquarters building in Arden Hills, MN, a new CEO, a large workforce across the US, and diversified businesses, there is a lot going on and plenty of chances to try something new.  The autonomy, general management aspects, and interaction with my cross functional teams across all my roles at Land O'Lakes have been the most rewarding."
good,"This really is a great place to work. The company cares about employees and I truly feel like I have work/life balance. This is a tumultuous time to be in the ag industry, but the vision from leadership is positive and makes me excited to see what the future holds."

All things considered because the LOL Tulare plant operates 24/7 we worked a 6/2 schedule with two consecutive 3 day weekends  off every 5 weeks, Fri-Sat-Sun and then a Sat-Sun-Mon, so working 20+ years in the 24/7 milk hauling business this was an excellent work schedule."

Every Thursday was a company huddle, that would consist of the whole company meeting at 10 am to openly talk about the Pro's and Con's of our company. We had a Summer company picnic. The company also would give all employees a chance to go to the Cheese Festival in Shelburne, Vt. And I will miss the  goody box that we would get around Thanksgiving. I thought the company party at Xmas was  the greatest. We would receive a bonus. And in the first of the year we would find out  about the profit share bonus."

good,"after a huge downsize i was given the unbelievable opportunity to take the position of Credit Manager over 5 states which keep me busy but I loved it.  the company supported every aspect of the job and encouraged me to learn more about what our clients (farmers) did. Being from the City and working with Farmers, it was fascinating to learn about field crops, yields, fertilizers and etc. The hardest part of the job was know that a difficult year had past and the farmer hadn't made his estimate of yields and still had to pay the balance for products.  The best part of the job was travelling to meet each one of them and knowing their circumstances."
