rating,review
bad,Ok pay if you can deal with the other nonsense .Bad management is the norm.No advancement potential. Very hot in the summer very cold in the winter. Us versus them mentality. No appreciation for hard work only inconsistent decision making and disingenuous leadership.
bad,The managements has favorites and if you are not on the list they treat you like you are worthless they treated me like i was nothing the day i started. I would not wish this place on my worst enemy
bad,Rarely have forty hour weeks and overtime is very scarce. Management targets any employee who asks questions and never stands up for their understanding or well-being. They raise their voice  and talk down to employees no matter how they are approached/the situation. Employees constantly aren't given answers by leadership and have to go to Human Resources. Retaliation from leadership is guaranteed and is extreme. They routinely question and hover over employees as they do their jobs. They target those who they don't like/want to quit or be fired. This seems to in order for them to make up a reason to fire them. Not a professional place to work.
bad,"Horrible place to work go to youtube type in pca deriider plant explosion, they dont car about employees thats for sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
bad,The supervisor didn't care about anyone. Was in the office a lot. They let us leave 20 minutes before shift ended. People ate on the floor and used their phones. They are based on a favoritism scale.
bad,"The will berate, abuse and purposely Injure you. From day one I worked my butt off a d got no recognition, only mistreatment, after my car accident they repeatedly put me in positions just to hurt me so I would quit."
bad,"Very high turnover rate, almost like a revolving door type of situation. Management is very dishonest pitting employees against each other to get what they want. Production over safety and no home/work ballence. Pay could really be better."
bad,"This was a terrible company to work for. To start, I hope you like to live your life their in the summer months, mostly 10 to 12 hour days and mandatory overtime on most Saturdays. Management is absolutely terrible, most of them have no clue how to manage anything. The moral of this workplace is the lowest I have ever seen. It is a true sweatshop in the summer, be ready to be soaked head to toe 10 minutes into your shift, on top of the corrugator it can get to 130-140 degrees in the summer and around 100-110 in the rest of the shop. They expect you to work miracles with equipment that hasn't been properly maintained since the 60's. When the machines break down they usually blame the operator for the break down when it is out of their control to why it broke down. They give you very little time to do any preventative maintenance on your machine. When the machines is finally running decent and you get good production numbers you never get recognized for the good work you do, but if you don't get those numbers they basically degrade you. So to end this review I will say that if you like working long hours, sweating all day and not being recognized for the good work you do, this is the best company to work for. If you like to work normal hours in a comfortable work environment and get appreciated for the work that you do, look elsewhere, this is definitely not the job for you."
bad,If you want to work 12 hours a day 7 days a week this is the place for you . When it was Columbus container it had a bad rep no one thought it could get worse then PCs came along and proved that wrong. No one in management has a clue how to treat people.
bad,Bad behavior is tolerated by management. If you’re protected class employee you can do whatever you want. Political correctness is out of control! HR will leave you in a bad situation rather than address bad behavior over political correctness. Stay clear!
bad,"You work five days a week from anywhere to 8-12 hours a day. Everything is quick, its hot inside. You must be prepared to work because the day can turn into a longer one"
bad,"Do not take a position at this mill, it is a total waste of your time and talent.  Not a happy place to work.  Lots of harassment, lots of managers that have inferiority complexes.  Managers have been there for years, and they don't mind throwing anyone under the bus to save themselves.  Very dishonest people to work with- if their investors knew what really went on at the mills, I don't think they would invest."
bad,Company doesn't care about their employees and will work you to death. Always worked weekends and had no family life. Poor management. Union sucked didn't help employees were for company.
bad,With the acquisition of Boise jobs are being eliminated and if you are not protected by someone in upper management you are a dead duck!  Unstable company at the moment.
bad,"company sucks junk machines unsafe work areas,coworkers are on drugs."
bad,Don't work there. Bunch of drama queens. Management sucks. Union sucks. Union doesn't help. Supervisors dont know what there doing. People become supervisors by brown nosing even dough they dont know what there doing. New hires become supervisors just because they have a family member as one already. To many families work there and act like they run the place. TO MUCH FAVORITISM
bad,"management, from the top to the bottom, is terrible. if you are a good worker then you are the only one expected to work while others get to stand around. only work here if you need a paycheck immediately, dont expect to get anywhere by working here. work every week with monday-friday posted and watch the posted 10 hours get changed to 12 and on friday they will post that you have to work saturday. terrible work life balance."
bad,"I do not recommend working here, they can't make up their mind if they want to keep employees or get rid of them, plus they great their temps like trash and they act entitled because they are full time employees"
bad,"Could be a good company to work for but upper management constantly changing shift schedules and daily work. Which causes stress at home and at work."
bad,"Management has gotten very poor . They only advance they people how are lazy and don't have a clue on how to be in management this odds a dictatorship ""do as i say not as I do"" they preach safety but really don't practice it. There is no representation for the employee due to the lack of a union. They keep it that way by striking fear by saying""they will shut the plant down"" it is the blind leading the blind you move up by who you know not by actual work ethics"
bad,60 hrs a week 6 days a week. One day a week off is not the life to live. The management only cares about making their numbers look good. They don't care if you ever see your family
bad,"I have no words that would explain the Corporate Headquarters in Lake Forest, IL."
bad,"Management at Columbus IN location dont have the ability to change the culture. Supervisors treat employees bad, and upper management allows it. Safety is only important as long as it dont interfere with production. Turnover is horrible. No one to voice your opion to, they dont care. So, until PCA cares enough about its employees at Columbus facility, and change all of the local management, the employees will, suffer. Hopefully this experience will help in the future, before Iwaste 3 and a half years. The employees that I worked with are great people . Would by far say, dealing with management, was hardest part of job."
bad,Rainbow rainbow rainbow long boring boring boring LOL me some more gourmet dog and I don’t even know where else to say because the sober and is so whack
bad,Unless you are a select few in good with the union president you can pretty much guaranteed to be written up regularly. The location lacks strong leaders and has an unwillingness to move forward with new methods or push the facility to it's capabilities. The facility is highly outdated and the equipment is not much better. With the competition for this industry in the local area it's only a matter of time for PCA to fold into another one of the companies in the area that control the market. You will work every weekend and summertime you will be working in what equates to a sauna. There is a complete breakdown between management and the workers and the hiring of outside management prevents some of the qualified people there from trying to better themselves and move up in the company. Disorganization and lack of following any procedures is a major setback.
bad,"Worthless company with a boss who does not want to be there. Everyone wants to leave. It is in Phoenix AZ. Working for them is miserable. The general manager is never there, month end close is stressful and the boss gives you a packet the first day and expects you to know everything. There is NO TRAINING."
bad,"7200 mars drive is not a good facility to work at, shipping/ rollstock supervisor is trash he doesn't know what's going on in the departments he just goes by hear say, favoritism runs deep here at this facility,  you have to be a yes man in order to get recognized for anything,  all the hard work you put in doesn't mean a thing to him, you're just another number."
bad,"Pros good pay and you'll lose some lbs because of the constant moving and its super toasty."
bad,"Horrid management. They sit you down for 3 days vomit all this info at you, but none of it tells you how to do your job duties. Then they, basically, take you to the floor, drop you off, and say good luck. Then when you mess up everyone gets irritated with you even though you have little to no idea what your doing. "
bad,"Terrible work atmosphere. You pretty much live there, working 12 hours a day sometimes 6 days a week. Management makes alot of bonehead decisions that make no sense. The union is geared more towards people that have seniority. New people have no say in schedules and can be moved from shift to shift constantly. You will make good money and have decent benefits, but you will be treated like trash, to me it wasn't worth dealing with the bad attitudes that workers and management has there."
bad,You are lied to by the people who interview you. Reprimanded for even the slightest mistake even if the  process and company policy were to blame. You are expected to work 83% of your weekends during a calendar year. You are given less than two days notice when forced to work mandatory overtime. Poor management from the top down. Pay and benefits are OK but expect to their slave for them.
bad,Your told to help others but later are written up for not completing your own job. Managers want so much done with no time and always play the blame game. They mislead you. Whatever you do they are never satisfied
bad,Must work lots of overtime. Management is constantly making more work and life harder on you. Take away help to make jobs harder.  12 hour shifts mandatory when someone is on vacation.  No training.
bad,You are just a body to them.  They don't care if you have family.  They will force you to stay late and work weekends.  They don't care if you get family time or sleep.  They thought I was stupid when I asked for time off to be at the birth of my child and threaten to fire me if I took time off. If you are ok with being bullied and work for a company that doesn't take care of its people work here.
bad,Bad management. Union business and company business are combined. All of the Union people with positions where offered lead positions and they took them.
bad,"Employees get forced on 12 hour shifts daily, i have worked 87 out of 100 saturdays since being there. Had requests for time off for a wedding denied 5 times. The only way to get a day off is to have a doctors note. PCA SUCKS and i can not wait till i get a new job and can quit that dump"
bad,"They say they use the golden rule, but they do not care about their workers. They use them, mistreat them, then spit them out. Anything for the bottom dollar! You give them everything and they never say thank you, they just want more and if you don't give it they will find it somewhere else."
bad,Upper management needs help in reviewing incidents to relate to the employee. And to get input from others before acting on certain aspects of co m pany rules .
bad,"Poor management, very low moral, no care for employees, conflicting goals between employee care and production of product and safety. Very little communication between working weekends, meetings, and other."
bad,"I loved working there, pay raises are good, coworkers are real cool and easy going, but I worked on the 3rd shift and my supervisor was TERRIBLE. Racist, did not know how to talk to people at all,  he has no social skills whatsoever, but he talks to people like they’re children and since he’s a hard worker and gets work done, they sweep every problem with him under the rug. If you get discriminated or treated poorly here,  there’s no point in even telling the managers because they WILL NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT."
bad,"I advise anyone other than white not to work there. I qualified for the job. But if your a different race they look a different at you. "" Make America white again """
bad,The coworkers are wonderful. The management and the way they run things are comparable to a rollercoaster ride that never seems to stop. You’ll work 6 days a week every week. You’ll work 12 hour shifts everyday unless you never agree to one to start. You’ll be judged very harshly. You’ll be belittled until you’re a zombie walking around. Breaks are 2 10 minute ones and a 20 minute lunch. Every Monday meeting you feel less and less valued as an employee.
bad,they will work you 6 days a week and managment treats you like a number they do not care about safety until someone gets hurt. there scheduler must have got his skills from a crackerjack box. no one there is happy they are just there for a paycheck.
bad,I understand production is king but pm the equipment with proper maintenance so the employees and their family don't suffer. Worked pretty much seven days a week for 3 months. Everyone worked nearly every Saturday. In-fighting with management. No true leadership at any level.
bad,"Not enough workers,way to many salary. Mico manage. Hostel work environment. Can't afford to fix things.    ITS THE WORST COMPANY TO WORK FOR.  "
bad,"I have worked for the Hexacomb Division of PCA for many, many years."
bad,"New management is needed "
bad,"Job was not as promised   Much favoritism among employees  Training was not as promised.  Was reprimanded to doing company work. ( I was doing online training and the Controller reprimanded me and told me I should have come to her for more work if I had ""spare time""   Online training classes were part of my yearly goals).    Some mistakes were made by myself in training and was severely reprimanded for them, and the same mistakes were made by the controller and nothing was done.  Same mistakes I made were made by other co workers and nothing was said."
bad,"a typical day at work in PCA would consist of 8-10 hours of endless work, constantly recycling and cleaning, while running on 3, 10 minute breaks, if you were lucky. Not a great place for you if you're a temporary associate."
bad,"you usually work 8, 10, or 12 hour shifts. I have learned that being a good worker will get you some incentives.  Management should listen to the employees more often.  Being around other co-workers and having fun makes the day go by quicker"
bad,"I worked there for almost a month and I never called off and always did what was asked of me, then got laid off because they didn’t have work. I understand it’s not the company’s fault but to be lied to by management that we had work coming in and weren’t going to be slow was absolute garbage. The least they could have done was been honest."
bad,"I've never in my life been scolded by an employer for *only* being 2 minutes early for a work shift before. That said, I've also never been required to work 5 ten hour shifts a week and not been given a lunch break before either. Only one person in the building seemed capable of smiling. In my month under their employ my immediate supervisor hadn't bothered to ask ""How are you?"" even once. "
bad,Management has ruined this place. It be a great place to work but management it self make sure that you always feel like you're on the edge of getting fired. The benefits are good the hours are good the people that work here are great management really is the only problem.
bad,"Micro managed workplace, rules and guide line change constantly. PCA preaches a non hostile work environment yet corporate and local senior management do not understand this concept. The workforce has seen a constant departure of managers, superintendent's and front line supervisors. Over all this company has evolved into the worst company I ever worked for."
bad,Mandatory endless twelve hour shifts. Good compensation. Three out of four employees are fired or forced to quit. Very poor job work / life balance.
bad,"Longer days, this company does not have protected territories so reps overlap each other"
bad,"as a spotter there is no growth no chance of moving up into a better position, once a spotter always a spotter, the spotters are constantly blamed for lack of production and are constantly asked to do tasks that are not in the job description and are the lowest paid in the mill maybe even the entire company as a whole. the union never fights for the spotters.the company recently went into contract negotiations with the spotters union and where promised a 90 cents raise and shift differential pay but that was randomly taken away the perfect example of this company’s greed they don’t care about you as spotter overall the best things about being a spotter is probably the schedule and benefits other than that that’s about it"
bad,"Very difficult place to work.   Only production workers were valued.    Office workers were seen as a necessary evil, with little or no respect given to them."
bad,"Originally starting this company was amazing. The probation is where most new hires find it's not for them. If you can handle the 12 hour shifts and occasional Saturday shifts. "
bad,Management was horrible.  Worked us way too many hours.  Not a good life/work balance.  Hard work.  Very hot working environment.  Felt unappreciated.
bad,"A very production driven company that is very concerned with money, and the company puts the employees second when it comes to production.  End of story."
bad,You work and you leave there is nothing to be happy about there. The supervisorsare to scared to take up for you and the management will just as quick to fire you as they was to hire you
bad,Everyone worked long hours and daily OT was expected.  Workplace culture and Management needs a lot of improvement.  No room or opportunity for advancement.
bad,Boise Inc had started to improve a lot of the employee benefits and had programs to help employees work for advancement. Once PCA bought out Boise all of that changed and everything became about the stockholders and the executive leadership team.
bad,When working here it was during the summer and it was hot and we would be stuck in traffic everyday.The pay was weekly which was good and we got paid based on how much work we did.
bad,great place to work an pay scale but when you reach the yop of the pay scale they let people go to bring in new employes to work for less money
bad,Typical day at work is getting to make a terrible machine run fast enough to please management.  Adding tape to machine constantly to try and fix them.  Non of the management know anything about the machine and don't understand any problems you are facing while running.
bad,Plasmet/ Newell recycling gave me the opportunity to do what I love most and that was to build my own control panels from my own constructed scematics to fit their newly installed equipment. The exposer all types of weather conditions in an open environment had proven to wear on ones health at times. My daily task was to support production .
bad,"Great pay and benefits. Poor management practices, "
bad,"For someone looking to build a resume with little time away from work for family. Not for a family person. Micro management at its finest. Production, Production, Production!"
bad,"Worked here for 6 years place went to poo after Effex management solutions replaced Aerotek. Line leads and management are very rude and disrespectful. Treat you like kids, make you sign sheets to go to the bathroom or get a drink. Ethically challenged enviorement, name calling and disrespectful people to work with. Weekly pay. 10.50 for 2nd shift and 10.00 for first. Not worth the time or money for the stress you endure."
bad,Overall it wasnt that bad. The main thing i believed to bother me the most was the pressence of power displayed by the upper management. every little thing was addressed all the time. id seen people fired for simply forgetting theyre protective goggles which could have been replaced for the day with no hassle. then i watched a guy sleep standing up multiple times and it tokks 2 months for him to be fired. so there was also a heavy favortism factor.
bad,"I came in and was told by machine operator what we were going to do."
bad,If you have kids your never going to get to see them.  HR is out to fire you.  Management doesn't care what happens as long as they look good in the end.
bad,The only thing great about this job is the co workers..Supervision from front to back is unorganized and short sighted...nothing much else to add except the excellent on site human resource group and good co-workers
bad,"My typical work day included cold calling on a daily basis generating opportunities.  This was my favorite part of my job, meeting new people and creating new opportunities.  However, management was not supportive could not turnaround quotes in a timely manner thus loosing opportunities.  The hardest part of my job was the lack of support.  My only saving grace was the support from coworkers and brainstorming sessions we would have on a regular basis. The most enjoyable part of my job was the balance I could have between work and family."
bad,The management could be better. The place is very micro-managed
bad,It was a good company but the supervisor sucks didn’t know how talk to employees he used to scream at us he just didn’t have a way to talk another thing that he would stand behind you will not let you work inpeace
bad,"this was a great place to work,untell they got new management,after that everything wentb down hill from there..but the employes are great people to work with,just need to watch who u open up to there thow"
bad,"average, good benefits, descent pay, not much room for growth into upper management. small group of people at the particular location. machines could use upgrade."
bad,I was there for a while and I felt that the people in my position were not treated fairly.  Management did not have a clue what went on out on the floor.  Hourly workers were oftern overworked with nothing to show for it and for no reason.
bad,Though the pay is good there is little to no work life balance. Poor communication between management and employees there is no sense of accomplishment instilled in the employees. Ultimately its extremely easy to burn out and become scornful.
bad,I pretty much lived in there & never had the time to see my family. I wasn't able to make plans on the weekends with family or even have time for myself. it was always sleep then work or call when needed.
good,very stressful. and hot place to work. Pay is pretty decent. Could use better benefits like vision insurance. Hard to advance. Wish they were more family orientated.
good,"A typical day their you would go in for you daily shift meeting the  go to the floor to your machine and begin work "
good,"Revolving management doors. Poor work/Life balance. Typical corporate environment. Certain locations more stable than others. poor compensation for what is required. Difficult to move up, although lateral opportunities exist."
good,"Long hours during busy season, then during the summer your lucky if you get 30 hours."
good,It’s a great job! It could be better with simple management. To much in a hurry to do nothing. The pay is ok. But the abuse that your body takes it should be better.
good,"You need to fit certain specific profile to work within this company. If don't fit that, you're very much screwed!! There was no work-life balance as they advertise."
good,always had to stay busy. a lot of favoritism. Had to work a lot of overtime sometimes Saturday and Sunday. People in the office did not have a clue what the people in the rest of the warehouse were doing or how things went on a day to day basis.
good,i have learn alot in the time that i have been there i learn how to manega with people i learn how to comunicate with other and the importance of taking your job very seruious since it is a dangerous job
good,I wish not to talk about this company.  I left on my terms and they said they terminated me.  never got any paper work in the mail from them stating that I was terminated.
good,"No matter how much time you put in and bend over backwards for them you will never get hired in. If your a temp the treat you like you do nothing, and that your worth noting."
good,they want someone that is going to live here. don't care about you family life. I often work 12's and am expected to work 7 days a week not caring if I see my wife or kids. and when you bring that up you are told well it was your choice to take the job. if you are single and not close to your family good job for you. if you have a family and actually enjoy spending time with them. not so good.
good,Overall the company for me was great at the beginning I have never worked at a place like that. Before i was eager to learn every machine and go above and beyond but then like any other job I started to notice well there really isn't any growth to this job I got bored and angry so I left . But if you like a slow and steady job this is your place
good,$20+ hr good overtime the ability to 72 hours a week year round and great benefits and 1/4 bonus and a gain share check a week before Christmas ok place to work some lines don’t get breaks
good,"Be prepared to complete work of 3 people in your position. Overall good place to work with sufficient benefits, but no opportunity for career growth or promotion."
good,This is probably the most stressful office I have ever worked in with a supervisor that was not a nice person.  Not much more to say about this position.
good,"Controlled customer provided inventory."
good,Was good just wanted to be hired on. Loved doing what I was doing. Was the main bander operating the 2nd shift for about to or so. Looking for something the same
good,Steady job roles and friendly employees who supported each other. Prepared packaging materials for transport during the day. Loaded material onto pallets and secured them before being transported to another locaton.
good,No upper management support but good place to work. worked alot of weekend due to not get product out during week. great flow but no go planner to take advantage of mix.
good,"Horrible place to work. Favorites are played here, very poor management. This company is ran on quantity and numbers. Employees safety is not a great importance to the company."
good,Would never recommend this company as they have no sales territories and my manager would not go to bat for me on issues when it came to our own sales reps running into my accounts.
good,"PCA is a very profitable company, but it does not appreciate those that make it profitable ... the production workers.  Safety of the worker is a joke ... OSHA mandates safety and PCA puts on the act, but when it comes to the almighty dollar, the workers are forced to work in unsafe conditions.  Breaks or lunches .... NO .... even if you work a 16 hour day (I imagine since they provide water we should be more appreciative.)  Management is a joke, unreliable, uncaring and carry themselves as if they could walk on water (plant GM actually has the words ""Big Dog"" on his helmet.)  The ratio of salaried personnel to hourly staff is an amazing 1:2.7.  With only two (out of 5) knowledgable shift foremen, the production workers must contend with sheer ignorance. There is no quality of life to be had with PCA's rotating shifts (especially with the understaffing which results in outrageous overtime - hence, exhausted employees with a high potential for injury.)  The plant runs failing equipment yet they are investing a quarter of a million dollars in a machine tender shack. The corporate office really needs to rethink the way the Filer City plant is run .... Corporate would learn what really goes on (conditions, etc.) if they met with hourly staff, but not with the GM (or any management) at his side because they would be fired."
good,Pay was okay slow paced hot environment. Good benefits okay supervisor. Employees easy to get along with understaffed. Worked very long hours graveyard. Shift
good,Overall PCA is a good employer. There is a great divide between production workers and office workers in my particular plant. There have been several upper management changes and with each manager the environment changes. We are supposed to have an open door policy but there is very limited access to the general manager. The equipment is outdated and in poor condition which limits production and quality and also lowers morale. Work/Life balance is terrible.
good,"I am looking for a job to better suit the needs of my family, I work 2nd shift 6 days a week and hardly have any time with them because theres work to be done at home too."
good,"Employees were rude, always hot in the factory which is to be expected. 12 hour shift for 6 days a week."
good,"It was a fun workplace cause you got to get dirty, the competition that you experience with the other employees like who machine could print the most boxes with no mistakes in a certain amount of time. The family fun days and the christmas parties or all apart of what made this a fun workplace"
good,I worked over 1400 hours a year overtime and no days off. No time for my wife and kids and that has caused irreversible harm. Hind site is that is wasnt worth the money I was paid.
good,Worked here for 6 months. Great company but not the best managers. I think the union should be done away with.  If your at the bottom end Meaning if you’re low on the seniority list be ready to work a lot of mandatory overtime. Everyone is so miserable and I think it’s because of the management.
good,Stressful work environment. Managers expect more than your able to do . They typical cannot do the job they task you for and then blame you for their failures. Moral is low and your home life is never known because they want you to work weekends with only a days notice. Money is good. Benefits are good.
good,"Work is mostly constant. Company has a motto to never say no to a customer, so requests can become ridiculous. It becomes monotonous very quick. Speed is expected, even with mechanical errors. It's a warehouse. I was excellent at my job and moved up fairly quickly, but not much room for advancement to leadership roles, especially if you don't have an almost ""dictator"" attitude."
good,"I got into the company through a job agency."
good,"PCA is a very driven company with heavily involved corporate management.  Corporate mananement is very committed to their operations and demands the same commitment from their employees."
good,Productive place to work give you opportunity to learn.  Also small warehouse and hardest job was keeping up with the floor and unloading truck at same time. Most enjoyable part of job was being a Forklift operator and some of the employees
good,The management doesn’t care about their employees. Forced 12 hour days constantly and you work every Saturday. Work life balance should be zero stars. But the pay is good for what we are doing. Working here short term is good but in the end you will need to leave for a job where you get some respect
good,"Not very organized, no time for family, very good pay  very good benefits too much wasted overtime communication is not a strength , extremely hot work environment"
good,Shipping and reviving and warehouse has no advancement it's a dead end job.the rest of the plant is okay you can advance in all other positions. Lots of overtime available.
good,"very fast paste long hours, maintain housekeeping also push and "
good,Compensation is above average.  Work and Life balance challenging at times.  Demanding Management team.  Upward mobility challenging in a remote location.
good,job was ok i went through a temp service so the hours were not promised.but when you did work you were able to work 8 hours. fast paced and very competitive because every one is trying to get hired on through the company.
good,"moderate equiptment,good people,good management,long hours on short notice"
good,"Purchased all raw materials from chemicals to shippers for my accounts. Scheduled manufacturing and filling lines with that department, supervised lines throughout process then shipped all finished goods to desired destinations requested by client via 3rd party carriers."
good,"The company began changing to become non-empathatic towards family type issues. Which is one of the main reasons that anyone gets out of bed in the morning. I had a very serious family issue, that toke time to resolve. The company was unable to give enough time to for me to heal and return to work. So after ten years of employment I was forced to seperate from the company."
good,"(PCA) is and good job to work at, it keeps you busy and you learn a lot of new things. Only they do not pay enough because they expect you to learn the assistant job and The operators job on how to run the machine when you are getting paid the minimum wage that the job gives you because they rotate on breaks and lunch, and most of the time it would be me to run the machine while the operator would leave and the assistant is only doing his part because he wants to be lazy and there's a lot of lazy people at that company that don't know how to pull their own weight or to even work as a team. And they go by favoritism, and management really sucks, the supervisors don't ever really do anything when you report to them about you having a problem with somebody else or your team because of its somebody that the favor that you got into it with he won't tell them anything but if it happened the other way around it will tell you something if you're not one of their favorites and they also will tell you something if you take your brakes longer than usual but they don't tell other people anything when they take 20 minute or longer breaks. The company also robs a few minutes of your break and lunch every single day. There's so much to say about the company but it is a good place to work at they just need a lot of changes but one of the other bad things is that if you are wanting to use a day f your vacation for any Saturday, you automatically have to waste another vacation day for Monday which is not right because that is against the law but they force you to do it."
good,If you want to work about 75% of your “off days” this is the place for you!! If you want to get treated like human waste by management you’d get all you want. The pay and benefits are good. Everything else greatly outweighs the few positives.
good,Management is aging and could be better facilitators. The Safety culture in the company is not supported well by plant level management even though the company considers it to be the most important area.
good,PCA is a very good corrugated packaging company to work for. The culture there is very good and there are opportunities to advance id you are willing to relocate.
good,The company is large. Pros and cons that apply here do not apply to other locations. Packaging Corporation has the ability to handle any kind corrugated packaging that you might need.
good,Company is very customer oriented. Pays extremely well compared to its competitors.  I enjoyed the daily set goals they had for the machine I worked on.
good,"High pay, with good benefits but with high expectations and very low opportunity for advancement. High workload with heavy lifting."
good,"Current plant has some issues, PMs not being done correctly but thats just lack of management."
good,"Good place to work at. Pay and benefits are good. Management needs to learn people skills. There are a lot of lazy people that work there, you'll end up doing things all on your own."
good,"It was not particularly fun, but the employees and employers were kind to new comers. The workplace was diverse and never was their any bias or favoritism."
good,"If you are not a member of union beware, management can let you go without cause & you furthermore told you are never to apply at this company at any location."
good,Not employee considerate at all!! Upper management is one sided and belittling of employees! Using bullying and “rule through fear” techniques to try and make employees do their bidding! No bonuses or insensitive for production!
good,Most employees have a bond good times on lunch breaks poor management though . The peak season is always great for over time 50-60 hours weekly . Benefits were great
good,do not question management even when they are wrong. nothing will change anyways. they are themselves lost and have no idea what they want. they are not listening to their employee. some supervisor are very cool. especially the swing and night.
good,Packaging Corporation of America  is a faced paced work environment. You will work six to seven days per week.  Packaging Corporation of American has a fair pay scale.
good,Not really appropriate time to ask about your former employer.  For proper evaluation you should ask a person about the former employer after they secure a new position.
good,"Hired as Customer Service Rep to assist Sales Rep with orders and a liaison to the Design Coordinator.  Easy, non stressful environment, nice friendly people work with."
good,"Start work with a list of duties to be performed on various machines for throughout my shift for preventative maintenance which might include tear down and replacement of encoders, rolls, bearings, etc. Each time I work on a machine for the first time is when I have learned about that particular machine thus making the task much easier the second time around. Our management team was thorough enough where minimal direction was needed to sought out a job through its completion. The most difficult of the job was the intense labor of beating or hammering seized objects to be freed or working with very hot steam and the duties that goes along with it which in many cases, we had no choice based on the time restraints. The culture in the workplace was enjoyable and everybody there was a pleasure working for or with throughout my duration there. The most enjoyable part of the job is the experience learning new facets of how boxes were made which fascinated me to some degree. Watching the process or knowing that the process is successful and that I contributed my time alongside my peers to make a good thing happen was the ultimate satisfaction before going home for the day."
good,This is a very fast paced job where everyone starts out as a temp. Better temps get hired. You are basically a nobody until you get hired into the company.
good,"Come in set up dies on machinery. Line up the dies and print multiple colors on corrugated boxes. The hardest part of the job was, "
good,it was a good job i would work there again i just wanted a better paying job that is why i left. The hours there were pretty good. Pretty easy job....
good,"Daily assist with the machine operations need to build packaging materials.  Trained for several weeks on day shift, then moved to night shift.  Hours varied weekly although position was considered full time."
good,It was a pretty decent place to work for and the pay was good. The people were nice and there werent any fights or anything of that sort there. Management was good
good,"Good work, easy once you've learned how everything runs, good benefits, great caring of employee's. Great incentives to work hard and take pride in your work."
good,I took pride in my machine as well as the product that I produced. Completing my tasks in an orderly fashion and to the best of my abilities.
good,first job and learned many things from experienced workers. helped me get a good idea about warehousing jobs and careers.
good,"The Atlanta Plant had struggled for many years with quality and customer retention. There was no real desire to gain local account business due to the high volume of National Account Business the plant was converting. There was a very real ""hump"" to get past when selling PCA products; They were limited in the paper combinations the corrugator could produce, greatly narrowing the local customer you could approach and service their particular needs. Good people but a severe lack of discipline and accountability."
good,"A typical day at work was work hard and safety first."
good,"I believe this will help me in my future management opportunities. it has made me some of the short falls that I had as a leader.  I have taken the time to watch how other supervisors act in difficult situations and would relate to how I would handle the same issue. Observing how other hourly employees act over different issues that arise and how I as manager could deal with there attitudes, what I could say to make them understand what is needed. Most of all I have seen how a positive attitude towards employees can make a huge difference."
good,"friendly work people and the southern hospitality."
good,I've learned better ways to be more productive since this company is fast paced.  Multi-task skills are always put to use on a daily basis.  The co-workers are friendly and easy to get along with. It's not fit for someone who is young and have a whole life ahead of them.  The management team uses favoritism from time to time.  Not a fun work environment.  Pay is okay
good,Good company with good managers and ROI results in the past.
good,"Great place to work with great benefits. Co-workers fine to work and enteract with, however, some supervisory abilities can be questionable."
good,"Pros- pay, overtime"
good,"There was limited work much of the time, days ending at noon or 1 o'clock when we were scheduled until 3.30. The work pace varied depending on who was working that day and how much work there was to complete."
good,Busy work environment .lot of hours.lot of responsibilities fast paced 15 minute brakes long hours and work a lite of Saturdays started working there in 2000 for Colorado container driving truck. PCA took company over about 6years ago dropped company driver.so I when inside to work
good,It’s a good place to make a living if you don’t mind the hours and having to be at work on your days off / holiday lot of rules from management that doesn’t have to Abide by them
good,"Great overall company, rates and benefits. Management was questionable at times and culture varied per location. Crazy hours and swing shifts, plus forced overtime and Saturdays made it hard to have a life. "
good,I actually didn't mind working for Pca. The issue was with management in the facility I worked at. Because I could operate anything I was expected to be there 70 hours a week to cover for others. Pay was low in that facility but not all. Other than that I overall liked my job while I was there
good,Steady not to strenuous work and good hours good employee cohesion. Also on the bus line witch makes it very feasible to commute back and forth for those who don't own a vehicle
good,"I show up to work and set up machine,sometimes multiple times a day. Run the order, fill out quality check sheets, clean up and go home."
good,"It's nice to know when you are working, which days you get off. Great benefits and pay. Set hours so you don't get confusion on when you are to be there. For the most part the co-workers are easy to get along with. Management still needs a little work. Still quite a bit of shift rivalry. I don't like the fact that there is little opportunity to move to different shift or position, but I guess it is a good thing that they don't go through several employees. Basically this job is long term once you get in."
good,hottest work environment I've ever worked. Learned to work new machines as well as in a team.Management communicated very effectively. Hardest part was working in the heat.The pay was great for the conditions.
good,Not a bad place to work there strict on being late or absent if your not careful you could point out fast but good pay and benefits and not a bad work environment
good,They were many good things about the company as far as bonuses and needing time off for family or personal reasons. They also made sure to involve everyone in news of the company.
good,this company is a good place to work but management could be better. this company also haves good work benefits. a typical day at work consist of set ups of the machine and equality checks.
good,"Not just a job, but a opportunity to succeed in life. On the other hand, too much mandatory over time can truly affect personal life but was usually because of short personnel on production floor."
good,working in a warehouse.loading and unloading trucks.meeting the demands of the customers and the company.doing daily inventory and safety inspections
good,PCA is a hard place to work at the hours are long the physical demand is high along with the stress. But they do pay very well along with union-based benefits.
good,First real career setting job. Been with the company almost 5 years. Hardest part of the job was maintaining  work life and family life. Wish management was more involved but overall great place to work!
good,Great place to work. Great environment and management. Very much labor included to complete tasks. I am a very good people person with a great personality. I am always willing to go over and above to learn new and improved skills.
good,"Ok place to work if you like to work 50+ hours a week and make an average wage. Overtime is unbelievable, all the time, mandatory. No room to grow. Consistent work and good benefits"
good,"I enjoy the work I do.  Some of the management staff like to push people to improve on things with no training to succeed.   The company as a whole is a great place, Marshfield needs improvement"
good,When I first started with pca I intended to stay for a long time and possibly retire with them.  After new management and horrible Human Resources that is over.
good,"It was a good job. I got by, but some of the people there think that they are the more important then everybody else. Not only that it seems that the Line Leaders don't even know what's going on half the time. But other than that I really liked the job."
good,"New Management came in to try to improve plant, but decided staff was the reasons things weren't working. Got rid of many good workers and found out that it's not the staff, but still the process is broken..Could re-hire some good workers that could still make a difference at the Atlanta location."
good,Averaging 70 plus hours a week. Pays very well but no life. Upper management has no clue. Hate going to work but pay is likely top 3 in the city. Parts room is bad shape and ordering parts is a process.
good,"This is a good place to work, good pay  and  a lot of over time. Good grup of people to work with a different. It is a good place for multitasking people."
good,"It was a paper plant that mass produced paper and cardboard. It was hot in the summer, and freezing cold in the winter. We worked long hours and a lot of overtime."
good,"The money was good, but the atmosphere was terrible between workers and management. Everyone is just a number and everyone is replacable even in management is the feeling everyone had."
good,I havent been an employee for over 20 years and everyone I worked with has turned over numerous times. Not sure of the culture now. From the GM down to the janitorial staff had has changed. From what I've heard the maintenance super has changed at least 6 times in the last 20 years twice when I was employed there.
good,"2/3's of the employees were laid off in one day.  No notice...Very sad day...Very hard on the family."
good,Management is cold and not very employee friendly!! They do not have a family atmosphere. It's do your job and collect a paycheck. No incentives are given to employees who meet or exceed goals.
good,Very stressful job with the new management. They do provide great pay and benefits They provide great accommodations for the floor employees. The company in whole is a great place to work.
good,"Nice workplace, good people, decent work, learned new things, management need improvement, needs ran smoother, co-workers were good people, hated the management. Overall a good place to make good money, needs to hire outside family and friends of co-workers"
good,Al empezar una nueva esperencia con otros compañeros fue muy bonito pero los mánagers algunos eran medios mal con los compañeros pero fue muy bueno trabajar con todos
good,Decent company to work for.  It provided assets to make a good living for my family  I just did not wnatadvancement and not to be stuck in a situation
good,The typical day was to look through reports and seeing what happened over the night shift. I learned what a chemical engineer would do in an industry setting.
good,working with co-workers.how to work with others. support management . clean workplace. learning more productive way of doing your job. going home to be with your family safely.
good,It could be a better place to work but like most fortune 500 companys the proscess and what  they should be happening is never hand in hand .so there is a drop off from management to corporate mansgement
good,"I actually was assigned to Packaging Corporation of America via a temporary agency.  I was promised that the job would become permanent after 4 months.  At the end of the four months PCA told me the individual who had made that agreement is no longer in that position and that PCA had a hiring freeze.  I continued on as a temp until someone with 15 years seniority at PCA wanted to come into my job.  Then I was relieved to go back to seeking employment."
good,PCA is a great company to work for with the exceptions of a few of the management team. I learned a lot from my previous manager and my Oxnard Team was amazing! Wish it didn't close.
good,Good place to work.  A very family oriented company to work.  Management was very knowledgeable and focused on training.  The people on the production floor were great.
good,most days at work were challenging communicating customer needs to production. kept track of inventory replenishments with customer service to cover future needs. many customers required dock times through phone or email contact. worked with the production people to ensure the customers requested delivery time
good,"had a great time with the group I worked with.  Worked a lot of issues on a daily basis but everyone came together to get the job done effectively, would work again."
good,"- Meeting pretty regularly"
good,"At Pca I've learned the following how to setup, operate, speed,safety and awareness.makes me happy when a jobs well done. Management could be better, every order completed​ makes me have a since of accomplishment.if this company would give promotions I wouldn't want to leave."
good,"Be safe, grow the business, have fun, and make money. If you expect it, inspect it; if you accept it, you promote it. The most enjoyable part of the job is to gather the efforts of many and celebrate successes, no matter how small."
good,PCA bought Boise Inc and many people have been let go.  It seems some of their business ways are done like a small company.  It's time to move on.
good,"Very busy work day. The time flies by. The management team are all great to work for! Everybody pulls together there. The only problem for me was I was considered a ""Temp"" employee and was promised to be hired as a permanent employee but never was. I didn't receive any benefits. My boss did get me a weeks vacation which he didn't have to do but felt I deserved and more."
good,"PCA was a great place to get started in a factory job environment. There was many opportunities for temps to get hands on experience learning different tasks from building partitions to being an assistant on a machine creating a box, preparing orders to be sent out to customer, entering data information for completed orders; learning about corporate, state, and national safety and environmental requirements; being part of a team. One of my supervisors took the time to teach me some specifics on data entry for the specific tasks I mainly preformed, I was trained on using a flatbed cutter so that I could occasionally do a project on my own or be the lead. I liked being part of a team as well as having opportunities to focus on finishing up projects on my own. The hardest part was getting used to being on my feet for 8 hour stretches, after a while I adjusted. I liked the work I was doing, I miss being a part of the team at PCA, I would like to be part of a team that is like a large family again that supports, encourages, helps one another out, and is more than just a workplace."
good,"Check list of orders and plan what order to run. Start setup through computer program then select correct cutting die and stripper for each order. Start set up on machine according to customer needs. run as efficiently as possible. Once that order is ran, start disassemble of machine and prep for the next order. repeat until shift is over. Then clean up area and go home."
good,I enjoy my job. I get along well with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the drive is over 2 hours.
good,"Daily Duties include: Accounts Payable, resolving invoice issues with locations and mail sorting."
good,start time was 6:30 am - 3:00.good shift over time was 5:00 -3:00
good,We often underestimate all the effort that goes into the corrugated displays...
good,Productive place and has awsome communication. Supervisor's have great teaching skills.
good,"PCA can be a fun place to work at, if you have the right crew. Everyone usually gets along and it can feel like a brotherhood. The job itself isn't that hard but the pace can be quite quick at times. Making adjustments is an every day part of the job. Keeping an eye on quality is the most important part of the work done."
good,At packaging corporation of America it is a very hands on job. It can be relaxed at times. It can be very fast paced and also stressful at times. There is always room for employees to better themselves. The company has great benefits. Great 401k matches. Good management system... for the most part. The company really will work with you to the best of their abilities. I would recommend working at packaging corporation of America. To someone who is eager to learn. Loves to work. Loves to see the work they are preforming transform from start to finish. From all ages. 18-80.
good,I liked this job and it's a tough one.But the lead over the FAB department finds and excuse not to hire women after you complete your hours for full time. She's is a jealous person and she dont give women a chance so be careful if you trying to get hired full time. Stay away from her and go to another department if you can.
good,some days were more challenging then others however it was worth the pay best to keep your head low and just do your job but even you will have to be on your toes
good,"My experience was pretty positive. Especially having worked at a few places since then. I was always busy, but not overly busy. Management and coworkers were personable and professional. Pay wasn't the best though."
good,"Very repetitive, setup and run, all day. Many drama queens, little cliques amongst employees. I was injured on the job and even though my production improved weekly after I came back, it wasn't enough in the company's eyes, so I was moved to a machine that demanded more physical labor. I was eventually fired when a lying employee accused me of racially motivated harm to him. Basically he didn't use his lockout tagout and was almost crushed inside the machine, he played the race card and I got tossed. Bunch of bull."
good,Good company to work for to be a field service technician. A family-oriented company. a company who like to serve the community. Good benefits and flexible hours.
good,It was a great place to work. Didn't have too many complications and co-workers have always made it a fun working environment. I would still be there if it wasn't for the lay-off.
good,"Great hourly employees but management will lie to your face:"
good,"In this position, I was treated as a full time Process Engineer. I was assigned responsibilities over the utilities' and  recovery areas. Process Controls and mechanical integrity were my main areas of focus. I was asked to interview with the company for a fulltime position after graduation, but I turned it down due to other opportunities."
good,"set up machine turn on  run all day"
good,Not sure why I had to leave. I miss my co-workers. Apparently I made my job look too easy and was able to finish on time everyday.
good,Nice place to work. Opportunity for advancement. pleasant work place.
good,"The employees have a bad moral this may be because of management changes but they will bring you down if you let them. the upper management is great but some of the mid level management does not know how to treat there employees. They want to push push push with no benefits and beat you over the head when something goes wrong,"
good,It has been a very interesting working environment. I never before had experience at a warehouse. This is not a job for someone who is still going to high school. Recommend for someone who is out of school and ready to work with your hands and always on your feet.
good,Good work environment very reasonable pay. Not hard on your body. But you are consistently lifting 40lbs to two hour increments. Managers the awesome.
good,Not horrible if you’re ok with a severe lack of communication in the corporate side. Pay was good. People were good for the most part. You have bad apples no matter what you’re doing. I was working the corrugator. Complex machine but we worked as a team. Wasn’t bad
good,It was great. Thay pay very well and the work is easy. I had to quit only because transportation issues. The people are nice and the work is vert relaxed.
good,"Managers at New Oxford Facilities still run company old school. Human Resources shares private info with thier friends. "
good,Great place to work with opportunity to grow and learn. aggressive company with expansion goals and opportunity to advance. career advancement and enhancement
good,I enjoy working with the production crews. Helping them grow as the industry changes as well as providing them with the support so that they can shine at their position.
good,"its a production job so your work schedule depends on the products that need to be shipped sometimes, its hot. the environment is okay , the hardest part of the job would be setting up the machine in a fast manner and making sure it does not malfunction"
good,"Ok place to work, but it can get stressful at time because your not at home enough, but pay is good and good people. Management could be better through communication"
good,"The company cares about their employees.  They have great benefits and compensation.  Great opportunity for advancement and on the job training."
good,"Typical days included the days beginning at 4 AM to 2 PM on overtime, and 5 AM to 1 PM regular hours. During my experience there, it was over time the whole duration of the summer. The management was amazingly good. They were helpful and always willing to explain and elaborate upon what was needed to be achieved. The hardest part of the job was the hours. It wasn't the usual 9-to-5 job, so a new balance of time was needed. Most enjoyable part of the job was loading and unloading trailers. This is because it kept me moving when I wasn't working on the assembly line standing in the same spot, and kept me much more active on the job. Most of the other people working there were temporary workers, with a few full time workers. It always had you meeting new people."
good,Had a great summer experience working for PCA.  The employees were all extremely friendly.  The management was also great at encouraging and teaching me my responsibiites
good,Very pleasant work place. Used accounting skills on a daily basis doing multi tasks.
good,"it is a good place to work, besides the rotating. Has good coworkers who hang in there . typical just do your job and go home, there are alot of positions to learned so you can move up, there are a couple of guys in mgmt who treats the employees bad riding the peoples back and telling them if they dont like it leave, you will be easily replaced, but if they dont come in warehouse it usually runs pretty smooth. I learned alot working here what dont kill you, makes you stronger. I had alot of good friends there and you do learned to become a team player."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and the work we did. It was never dull and it helped me build a solid work ethic in production work.
good,"Unstable job market due to the econony, too much down time due to broken machinery."
good,My time with PCA  was filled with many challenges and opportunities for growth. I received good support from my manager and General manager and was impressed with the company's community involvement.
good,"It's nothing but a BIGTIME GOSSIP CIRCLE!!!! At PCA LANCASTER!!!if people dont know why your off work or why you have FMLA,they will make stuff up and spread it all around the plant,then you look like a COMPLETE JERK!!!even some of the supervisors join in!!!and companies wonder why they have active shooter situations!!!(which i would never do just sayin)"
good,Every one has a designated job in the plant. Over all its a face pace job. The good thing about it is there is opportunity to be promoted in different jobs throughout the plant.
good,Work life balance a challenge but have seen where the employees are appreciated.Opportunities for people that want to work and provide a modest living...
good,"The people at the plant level are a pleasure to work with. They are hard working, dedicated and establish a true family atmosphere. If the Captain was able to sail his own ship without outside interference, things would go much smoother."
good,"Working for PCA was fun and very relaxed but very stressful, like there was never a break. The staff was very nice but some were unpleasant to be around."
good,"PCA was a great place to gain experience. I invested many years into this plant. The majority of my years working here were very happy. As things have picked up and the plant has gotten busier, working weekends became a thing to be expected."
good,"fasted paced,learned how to stack boxes,pretty good management,friendly,having to do someone else job,people i worked with.They were very big on safety which made me feel save to work there"
good,"It was a good job but not meant for me. "
good,Good place to work. Could pay better for the amount of work they expect out of ya. A lot of drama. Feels like being in high school all over again. They don’t do well with handling harassment issues.
good,Good work environment. People are helpful and will teach you what you do not know. If you work here and something breaks get ready to stay till everything is fixed and back up running.
good,"Typical day at work could include everything from meeting with customers, prospecting for new business, meeting with design or customer service to provide samples or data for new business opportunities or existing customers. Fairly typical SOP for a box operation facility."
good,Good company. Very fast paced. Way too hot. The people were probably the best part of the job.When Colorado container became PCA and when they took it over is when things went down hill
good,Paper making has somewhat of a reputation for being hard work and sometimes dangerous. I can attest that this is true. If you work hard and work safe and want good pay this is a good place for you. I built good relationships working hard side by side other good people. I would probably still be there if I hadn't decided to move cities.
good,While at PCA I was fortunate enough to be trained by a great management team.  Also was given free reign to procure business the way that I wanted to.  A hunters position that really challenged me.
good,solid company. 70 plants nationwide in the corrugated box business.Also have 9 paper mills. Company provides extensive professional training in all aspects of business.
good,"I had good co-workers,management let us figure out how to solve problems when they happen,I enjoy working with outside vendors with their cash sales"
good,Very Fast paced place  days go quick non stop work  winter time is good for the heat the machines produce but summer time is very miserable management for the most part is hands on  but as far as people skills they are very limited
good,PCA is an overall great company. Willing to educate their employes within their position and give them the tools they need to do their job correctly. They believe in a good work/life balance and they like to be involved in the community.
good,This company is huge and offers a lot to anyone looking to have a secure job for a long time. It does come with the pressures from up top. Make sure you have a good attention to detail.
good,Good benefits and union workforce. Unstable management. Retirement good. All because of union workforce
good,"It was a learning experience for me because I just got done with Abstracting and now to move to Accounting was a relief.  I love numbers and I was ready for it to start.  I was the one who did the things that no one else wanted to do and they all knew I was only a temp so they gave me everything they could and I was a fast learner so they were thrilled to give me things and I was like a sponge soaking it all in for my next and better opporunity. I loved what I was doing I felt like I was doing something that had meaing. Balancing invoices and paying bills was a thrill for me and I would go through my work so fast that I would run out of things to do. I was getting lost into my work and in a good way but I needed to slow down because I was working myself out of a job. My co-worker they were wonderful ladies to work with and they taught me a lot and I'm grateful. Making copies of invices for aduiting, going through all inventory and doing AP was mostly what my day was filled with, and data entry was always my favorite because I got to type which I love to do. If I could have stayed there I would have."
good,I worked at Packing Corporation of America as a cooperative student in the technical and environmental departments. I learned a lot about the mill and how an engineer works in a mill. I gained a lot of technical knowledge and the knowledge of how to work with others in my own department and other departments.
good,Great company from overall and local management. My supervisor passed away not too long before I decided to leave. Corporate offices are helpful and positive
good,"In the summer I spent there I was never given my own tasks that would be regularly my responsibility.  The accounting department delegated the less interesting work to me and I had some requests that had nothing to do with accounting, but that's how internships can be.  It was not a difficult job or an inspiring one."
good,Packaging Corporation of America has roots that go back 150+ years. The company offers a vast array of training courses and mentorship programs to those just out of college as well as those further along in their careers.
good,We became almost like family in the Orlando office and warehouse. Great place to work everyone did their best to pitch in during busy seasons and during inventory.
good,"Great benefits, great pay. Plant manager and HR not so good! A few supervisors were very rude and treated employees like dirt. I loved my job duties and did them correctly. Did what I was asked to do and didn’t need any training after showed once."
good,"Average work day is always 12 or 16 hours, Mill management is money hungry, lack of time off, disregard for safety, the bottom line is all that the management is worried about."
good,Very employee oriented. Bonuses offered to all levels. Challenging work load. Friendly coworkers. Great advancement opportunities.
good,"Little to no downtime, no lunch breaks. Get two either 10 or 15 minute break depending on manager. Straight 8 hr shift, lots of mandatory overtime. Mostly 12 hour shifts, get four 10 to 15 minute break, good money for hard workers. Bring your stamina"
good,The job offers a lot of variety and poses new challenges. Overall a great place to work with great people. Not a lot of advancement opportunity unless you are willing to stay long enough for someone to retire or quit
good,Overall I enjoyed working for this company.  Unfortunately I was laid off.  The people were pleasant to work with.  This plant has recently closed due to business.
good,"Absolutely loved working for this company, 50 hours a week, pay was excellent, benefits were great! People were friendly, started off as a temp, quickly excelled and got hired on full time. I would work there again."
good,"Striving to meet Customers Day to Day expectations in a timely manner.  Very High paced atmosphere. Working as a Team with Sales, management and the Shipping Dept. to ensure customer's satisfaction."
good,Extra heavy working but hey who am I to complain about work.. people are friendly mostly all the time and sometimes they provide lunch so its really an ok place to work
good,"The management is very personable and willing to work, and educate their employees. I would recommend Packaging Corporation of America (PCA) to anyone who wants to start a career in the paper and packaging industry. PCA has a competitive workplace environment."
good,"work hours usually 8-4:30 but lately there is a lot more overtime expected out of salaried employees with no additional compensation. "
good,I liked working there. It wasn't hard. Just the hours sucked. I would work there again if it was closer to where I live. I rest don't have anything else to say so goodbye
good,When PCA bought the business it became structured with more emphasis for documents and numbers. Not a bad thing. It allowed you to know where you stood against other plants in the corporation. Safety was a major concern and was proven by weekly safety briefings and meetings.

Supervisors were ok but my co-workers were the best, we always helped each other out with what ever needed done. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was the heat, the best part of the job was learning something new every day and the family environment."

good,A large plant with many areas to oversee. As Quality Assurance manager I had the opportunity to roll my sleeves up and work hard. The production personnel are superb individuals that take great pride in their work.
good,"I enjoyed working at PCA and gained a lot of knowledge on the production of cardboard while I was there. The only thing that can use a little more improvement is the management and how they schedule hours when they are shorthanded. Sometimes it takes them forever to hire someone that by the time they hire the proper amount of people, another person quits, leaving you exactly in the same position where you were before with a schedule that rotates and isn't always set. Other than that, great place that'll keep you on your toes and somewhat fit!"

I learned alot about chemicals, How dangerous they are; but also how much they can be used to create products for the company. The Co-Workers were all very friendly and any criticism given was productive and for learning purposes. The hardest part of the job was cleaning ""sludge"" from a catipillar front end loader with a power washer, not the actual physical activity but the smell was so pungent that we were required to wear a canister style resperator. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that everyone there was friendly and wanted to see you succed in whatever job was assigned."

There is a lot of training going on and they make sure you know what you’re doing on these machines because they are dangerous. They have schedules to keep as well.

I also learned to worked the strapper and conveyer line that strapped all the boxes to a pallet to get picked up by forklift for delivery to trucks. Management was always around and very helpful if I ever had questions and my coworkers were hard workers with good senses of humor and made the days go by more quickly.
