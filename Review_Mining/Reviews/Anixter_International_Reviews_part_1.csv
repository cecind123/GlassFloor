rating,review
bad,"Busy everyday. good variety in the job including fork lift truck driving goods in order picking van driving. "
bad,there isn’t much opportunity here unless you all apply for the same position. Most have favorites that will let them succeed while some work harder it’s unappreciated most of the time. Got hurt here while everyone laughed had waited about a week before having the manager come back at me and tell me to pull some metal strap out so i got hurt and then the metal strap had hit me so idk what is up with managers here
bad,"Anixter as a whole may be a good company, it may be a great company.  You would never know it working at the warehouse of the Burnaby location however, thanks to the negative, overtly aggressive, abusive behavior of the warehouse manager. Not to mention his shortsightedness and reactionary management style. "
bad,I didn’t like it because I was doing my Managers work for him and he took advantage of me. He was the only supervisor who didn’t help in the warehouse.
bad,Worst company to work for been there for 5 years and no place for advancing. If you are not friends with boss you get all the work. New boss did nothing but got rid of all the veterans cause they got paid the most and everyone was replace with new people to get paid less very stressful place to work at knowing someone new was guna take your job
bad,Terrible company takes accounts away from people who established them. Robots for managers. Marketing analysis week. Just another product provider in wholesale distribution
bad,The lead man was so rude every day. Like he had nothing better to do but to have me do all the work while everyone gets to hang out and talk. I was never put in one place instead they relied on me to do everything for receiving and shipping. They waited to hire another temp even though I had more time in. I decided to leave due to the traffic. Was not worth the stress going over there having to get hurt while the lead man was telling me to be pulling metal straps from the pallet. They don’t have any tools here they have it all thrown around. They don’t even have a good relationship here either. They all come to work to fight and gossip.
bad,You are fortunate if you don’t become the subject of a Federal Government investigation. Google “Anixter” and “Department of Justice”. There was always sufficient “Incentives” paid to win contracts.
bad,They point you for our own familys funneral and I asked them over three months get me on the forklift instead they fired me because I was trying to advanced....These people dont know how to run a bussniess ready to always point a figure....And always haave to over ask them for protective gear more then 5 times in one day.....These peoplel have no since how to work together let alone take care of there employees... Run awayyy
bad,the worst company i have ever worked for. over worked underpaid hostile work environment stressful manager was sexist. supervisor didnt know what to do
bad,"Stressful job and bosses used staffs. Staffs have to deal with clients aggressive behaviors and bosses just don't care about staffs we staffs have to cook clean bath feed and give meds and deal with the behaviors sometime it's not safe for is staffs but we do our job for the clients. I loved my job and my clients. We also have to take clients to putting and doctor appointments shopping work,"
bad,I did not feel it was a team effort. Things tend to follow the buddy system. Issues get passed from department to department. A lot of red tape just to do simple tasks.
bad,"Management is terrible with no patience.They make bad decisions,listen to their buddy employees about others.Will fire u fast!! Don't go to Mcdon. GA."
bad,"Arrogant upper management is clueless to the marketplace and a two percent up charge is charged back to every sales order.  Living in the past with their initiatives and marketing programs, and they have multiple business units selling the same products making it nearly impossible to compete against competitors.  There stock has fallen nearly 30% in the past year and they still do not know how to adapt.  Run don't walk from this company it is a horrible place too work, but everyone is afraid to say anything because of the fear of losing their jobs.  Additionally their benefits are bad, no retirement accept 401k, 1500 dollars out of pocket before insurance kicks in, Their are much better distributors who offer much more as far as salery and benefits."
bad,"This company was a fantastic place to learn and excel. Friendly people and management was great. The hardest part of the job was meeting short unrealistic deadlines. "
bad,"4 gm’s, a  COO, Vice President and an entire Human Resources team that were completely incompetent.  HR had its own agenda which it forced on the entire company and supported the horrible and toxic culture created by the elt."
bad,"NPD management supported supervision with low to no ethics on how to treat people appropriately. Not a department to expect anything from in ways of recognition, appreciated nor advancement.  The environment is toxic and management supports it from inside to outside."
bad,"Accepted a contract job in the credit department with the hopes of becoming a permanent employee, bi mistake. the department is porly run you'll work for peanuts."
bad,I can not give msny due to legal reasons per the company policy.  I have worked there almost 23 years and have seen many changes.  My managers would change almost every year due to them leaving.
bad,"Bad. Don't go to Fasteners in Indiana. Management is out for themselves and no one else. Turnover is sky high. If you are on salary, they will expect you to work mega hours without fair compensation. I was once sent an email that I would be expected to work weekends without compensation because they didn't want to pay overtime to hourly employees. (Really). Anixter has been trying to sell the Fasteners division for almost two years. Finally bought by AIP, (do the research) so it won't be Anixter after 6/1. Who knows what will happen to the company in a year."
bad,This is the worst company that I have ever worked for. They have no respect for there employees The supervisor demean you and there is harrasment from them.
bad,"The job description was nothing like what I did daily. "
bad,Management was hard to work with and did not provide healthy work environment for staff. Love the work I did just not management. My coworkers were wonderful to work with
bad,"leadership is largely dysfunctional, unjust and incompetent. The new CTO is an effective leader but is help back by his peers and the CIO does not have the courage to make decisions about currently dysfunctional leadership."
bad,They are not organized you go to one location it have 3 product in the location then you pick the wrong one then they give you a error but the staff is great
bad,Company was ok management didn't know anything constant lies.  Many of my piers were started at higher pay with way less experience and still wasn't fixed even after the fact.
bad,Benefits offered by Anixter are great.  Associates work hard and are sometimes not appreciated.  The opportunity to advance within the company is hard to come by.
bad,"Passive-aggressive people - narcissism - and the true lack of humanity and empathy you find in so many corporate jobs. There is a lack of appreciation for individual contribution and skill set, and you're expected to do something without being fully trained in an ""Oh, by the way, you need to do this, too"" type of way."
bad,"Only consistent thing they do is cut hours. Claim business slow, constant. Amazingly ridiculous decisions. Should be a good healthy, productive busy company. Office pogues ruin it."
bad,They will never keep their word especially when it comes to a raise.. we were promised a raise in January of 2019 it’s dang near June..high turnover rate.. if u do get a raise it’s only 30cents after a year. For all the certifications you get and the work should be paid more.
bad,The worst job I ever worked at. That don't pay you enough for the work they expected out of you. They don't want u talking just work. You will be disappointed in this job
bad,Got hired over the phone. Only spoke to my hirers once and got thrown into a job completely  unaware of what I was doing. Had little to no training at all. Ended up getting fired 3 months later for not doing things I never was trained to do. Bosses don’t call to check up on you or see how things are going. Communication is absolutely dreadful. Overall good pay but a very terrible job.
bad,"Account manager in a fast paced call center environment. "
bad,not a great job  people are good  pay is not good  25 cent riases. bad management.
bad,loader and order picker and Packer.
bad,Was subjected to verbal harrassment from co employees and the warehouse lead and was fired when others did the same thing and are still there
bad,"not managed well, poor communication skills, not run properly, ops and management don't communicate, no employee encouragement or appreciation. poor to no team w"
bad,The Dulles VA is off site from HQ in Illinois.  The male managers control the office (it's their way or highway) and HQ accepts their slanderous opinions.  There is no support to women.  All employees are not represented.
bad,"My Typical day at work there just fine. The work hours starts at 9."
bad,Never received training and was thrown into a totally different industry than what I was interview for. I interviewed for audio visual and ended us selling  able and wire. No training or support for Anixter management. Sorely disappointed.
bad,For the duration that I was employed at Anixter I found it to be very tense and uninviting.  Not only was I given false expectations regarding my role but also advancement opportunities.  A greater percentage of the employees were very unprofessional.  I would not recommend a carrier with this company.
bad,"Working at Anixter for 12 years was like a roller coaster, ignorance  and ran by typical white upper-class males .  Very intimidated by the women, we were totally under paid an unrecognized"
bad,Every department have there own policy on flex time and working from home is not welcomed.  This company has changed in the past 5 years from the best to not so best.  New managers have stifled the company.  People leave because of bosses not companies.  Great company awful management.
bad,"Friendly associates "
bad,"I won't recommend anyone coming here, the culture, management, and leadership are not aligned and won't work for you, basically, you are just a number"
bad,Some managers are actually good at their job and want to make other succeed while there are other newer managers there that are just worried about themselves. Manage by intimidation. workplace culture is pretty bad. Only a select few people actually enjoy their job here
bad,Anister is a great company to work for but the Cranbury Warehouse has poor management. They over work you and expect the world out of you with no resources or time to complete the task to their expectation.There is very little room to advance and expand your career.
bad,Work is not divided evenly . Long work days. It’s good pay but I would not go back. The work environment is not the greatest either. Only good part is they allow you to listen to music
bad,I worked almost 2 years for Anixter. For about the first 6 months to a year I don't think the manager knew my name. I worked at a satellite facility as a contractor. Should have been 2 people for the work load. I did a great job and busted my butt and the hosting company liked me a lot. I started at $17.00 and after 2yrs of great work and attendance I was making $17.42.........dont waste your time
bad,This job require a lot that does not pay base on there requirement. Where I always find myself helping other branches which take up time from me doing my work and I am not compensate for it .
bad,"When I was there management was horrible, I dreaded going to work every day. Their systems were homemade and very slow, I would find myself putting in extra hours to simply respond to a bid. Most of the benefits only benefit those at the corporate facility and the individual offices all run very differently."
bad,"Only the sales people are responsible for the actions of the entire company. Nobody does their job in support , commissions were taken 4 months after I started . Backlog was never closed no matter how much you sold you would never hit commission plan. No accountability from any warehouse, PA S , They taxed you at 50% on commission if you even closed your book of business for the month , which they internally sat on . Incredible amount of stress to deal with for little money."
bad,"they pay good money for a college student but for someone who has a family shouldn't plan on being there long. They tend not to listen to the employees needs, if you have a life situation at hand without vacation days say goodbye to your job."
bad,This is a terrible company to work for.  No support from management.  They don't have any respect for any of the hourly employees.  Anixter really needs a UNION to help them conduct business on a daily basis.
bad,"favoritism is abused at this job, productivity system were you have to meet 100% 5 days a week, learned how to drive forklift and got certified. they don't pass out work fairly so sometimes productivity isn't met."
bad,"The company most definitely doesn't care for the well being of its lower workers. If your sales or corporate then you have nothing to worry about and are golden."
bad,"Loosely managed, with favoritism heavily influencing upper managements decisions. Lack of direction and training and promises of high commission but very few tools to help you reach it."
bad,"I have never  worked at a employer that intimidates their employees like this company does.If you want to work where your overloaded with non job descrition tasks, not appreciated and made to feel like your only there by the grace of management.."
bad,Very cut throat sales environment. Support from management was almost null and void in fact the Supervisor/VP was almost never there  especially after lunch hour.  He was there in a.m. hours but most often did not return from lunch.
bad,"Anixter has great potential, but really needs to review it's management structure and hire managers that are collaborative and not combatant.  It is not a place for a diverse population."
bad,"A Warehouse job. Dark and very dusty work place. Spent most of the time cutting cable on a Auto reel machine. packing, loading and unloading reels of cable with forklift. Spent alot of time pushing the broom and cleaning up around the Warehouse. Best part of the day be able to leave early because I completed my duties for the day."
bad,"This place is not friendly. Everything you do time-wise is tracked. Most promotions are seniority based and merit based raises and/or promotions do not exist. There is a cut-throat culture amongst fellow coworkers that leaves everyone wanting to blame everyone else for any mistakes made. "
bad,"If one is very well versed on Information Technology, Fiber Optic and the myriad of types of copper wire products, one will do well."
bad,Maintained communications with all levels of organization including sales and warehouse management.Coordinated employees and materials between up to 25 production lines to maintain and improve labor and inventory. Managed 40+ hourly employees and temporary agency staffing.
bad,"Cold calls & sent e-mails daily to convince electrical contractors to sign on with Anixter. "
bad,It was a good place as a stepping stone. I learned a lot while I was there. They did not pay very well or seemed to care too much about their employees. High turn over in the dept. I was in.
bad,"Learnt about different cables and be came a supervisor, using fork lift truck to locate  and load drums"
bad,"Inside sales reps do all the work,  outside sales reps get to go play golf"
bad,"high volume calls"
bad,"Inside sales in a slow growth industry. There is a great deal of opportunity to learn more about the business of telecom, security, and other fields but the commission pay out plan is low."
bad,"The company has great benefits and the majority of the employees are friendly. "
bad,Anixter billed themselves to be a family oriented company that provides there associates with the tools they need to be successful in there company but in reality the company is slow to provide necessary tools to perform your job as well as a some what hostile stance towards employment. instead of empowering employees to do there job you are reminded almost daily that you are replaceable. I was also told that they promote from within but after seeing qualified employees being overlooked for positions only to have them filled by very inexperienced individuals that do not even know the basics of the operation I feel there is little room for growth within the company unless you take a low ranking position in another department.
bad,Some good people there but the culture is not welcome to new people. Very clicky. Most of the people have been there a long time and not open to change.
bad,"Very stressful work environment in local branch. Keep in mind this is from an inside sales persons perspective- but the pressure on outside sales is even worse. Overworked co-workers have no patience when it comes to training new employee's. So its pretty much sink or swim. Manager is friendly and helpful but is not empowered to add the additional help needed due to the tight corporate controls, he recognizes the stress but can do little about it. This position is advertised to have a monthly bonus program but be warned it was not clearly spelled out for me and was changed to suit the companies needs and they failed to pay me for the 1st full month bonus even though I met every objective and was indicated a monthly payment on my offer letter. It is one of the smallest bonus programs I have ever seen for an inside sales person who is responsible for so much business- though they were supposedly improving it. Pay here is mediocre, health benefits are very expensive and coverage is horrible for a company with more than 8K employees worldwide. Prescription benefit company is horrible. 1st years vacation is less than 1 week. You do have a 401K and a modest pension plan. If you are just starting in sales this might be a good fit."
bad,Work overtime don’t get paid for it instead they’ll do split shift which means you come in later mangers make rules up as they day  go so if the manger says this one day the next day it all changes no Real SOP or GOP just a hand guide that’s doesn’t make sense there favorite it this is how we also ways do it they will act like they care bout your opinion but really don’t warehouse manger has know idea how to be a manger
bad,"Company is trying to go too many directions with no clarification. There are positives there, company is good at feeding employees during meetings and making sure employees are well trained in the product of sale. Most days are dealing with issues with customers and internally. Management only drove monthly numbers and did not praise employees for good months only moved onto what you will do next month in revenue."
bad,"I worked at this company for over 20 years and for the majority of that period I was very happy being part of a happy but small team, based near London. Then for some obscure reason, head office in UK was moved to Warrington (not sure why), but presumably because the top bosses lived near there and it was easier for them to get to work!!!"
bad,ok job not the best. Pay is bad because you work for a third party. Co-Worx when i was there was aweful. Paid horribly
bad,"I have excel my IT skills at Anixter. I acquired the skill of working in busy and fast paced global environment. I learnt organising and prioritising work under pressure at work. "
bad,"This company was overwhelming always wanted us workers to know how to everything right. If we did not do anything right, they would want to let you go. I do not like there policy they have for when your sick, on vacation, coming in late, etc."
bad,"One day they told me I'm a good worker and asked do I want to stay in the company, and exactly next day told me they don't need me, and because of that I missed two other good job offers. Serious, people should pay fines for wasting other people time. Job like any other, for me this place was really nice, but I hate time wasters and Anixter really pi**ed me off."
bad,I worked under contract.  I sat apart from the department I worked for and did not receive much direction.  The work culture was not particularly friendly and the information from management was hit and miss.
bad,"no longer in business,Fast paced, energetic, demanding schedule, with many perks."
bad,"Anixter is a wonderful company to work for. They have a lot of benefits and great people."
good,management does not help with advancement and expects too much from employees. expecting you to do a job as one person that takes two people to do properly
good,"I started work by answering the phone and putting invoices in envelopes.  "
good,"Anixter is a fortune 500 company with an old-school approach to business.  Hours are long, leadership often emails employees on weekends and is not respectful of employees' personal lives, and there is little flexibility within roles."
good,"Good company, lacking in leadership.  They do offer competitive benefits and pay well compared to other jobs in the area.  They are a large enough company to have positions that you can transfer to if interested."
good,"Upon being hired , you are fed promises that this company has no intentions on delivering. Hourly employees are treated much better than management. Many employees joke about the revolving door of supervisors. "
good,"Hours aren't guaranteed if you work second shift. All goes by customer demand. Poor management, no room to advance, no raises. Ok job if you are young and living at home. Can't pay the bills off your pay. Poor training!!"
good,"Cutting Dept, job sucked! They always asked you to do overtime, but yet all the lead bosses were gone at their regular times. Everyone complained about working there and complained about management not doing a good job...also  I had a co-worker who worked there was getting ready to be hired on, they did not hire them because of a blemish on there backround check...Over worked underpaid !!!"
good,No muy buena relación con las personas que están afuera de la empresa y la dirigen ya que no conocen el mercado Chileno
good,The people are great to work with. Not much of a chance for advancement and management is stuck in the past when it comes to working from home or even being able to wear jeans. Plus they don't pay very well.
good,"Meeting after meeting without stakeholder(s) present, old issues rehashed (beaten until comatose - at least they could let some of the issues go). Poor communication of deliverables."
good,"Hard work with associated rewards. "
good,A good company gone bad due to unrealistic goals from senior management in the U.S. Once a very good culture now a very bad culture lead by poor senior management
good,"Multiple lay-offs after they bought out our company. They showed up like a knight in shining armor.... free food & drinks...making promises that our companies would be this massive monopoly in the industry. Long store short, our customers moved on & new jobs stopped coming in. No one was driving the ship!! My new boss had no clue what my job responsibilities where."
good,Is an Okay in between job. Nothing to make a career out of. More so a job for young people or people with no real bills. Getting time off isnt easy and you have to train everybody
good,"The teams are great. Many have worked here for 20+ years. The groups are unfortunately very silo-ed. Benefits aren't bad but health insurance is the most expensive my tax guy has ever seen. Management is very secretive with a real lack of communication and direction. Many IT support groups have just been told they are being outsourced in 90 days, but are only refereed to as ""the resources."" So you can see the compassion the officers feel for employee's. "
good,"There is no accountability from warehouse staff to HR. People get away with whatever they want. The pay is not close to what they expect from you, overworked and under paid."
good,Enjoyed working with customers and the resources we have for international business opportunities.  Very competitive.  You'll be held accountable for all aspects of the business deals from beginning to end.  You'll need to be a self starter and not expect much support/training when new.  This makes it difficult for new employees to catch on and find their way.
good,Average environment. Normal in the industry. Unable to determine different remarks. Relaxed culture. Great Overall company. Great business Corporate strategies.
good,"Very boring"
good,the company is ok to work for just remember employment over making friends and you will do just fine here
good,The work environment and customer base was nice.  Compensation and benefits are acknowledged as being low.
good,"cut throat, 2 faced managers, unreal unobtainable quota levels you are required to hit."
good,"Stable company, there some great people."
good,It's a ok place to work long hours mangers was ok to many changes not consistent enough with and how each department  was ran. They didnt value the employee opinions that much
good,There are many people who have had long careers at Anixter. If you are one to contribute more then just your basic responsibilities then this company is not for you.
good,"Responsible for National Account Billings, billing into unique portals, Update other collectors on invoicing issues. Worked with sales to resolve disputes, worked on special projects per management, met clients to go over billing and invoicing concerns,"
good,"Most of Anixter's employees have been there for many years. Being a young, creative person with a different perspective allowed me rapid success. Too much is put on the plate of the inside sales rep. More caught up in reactive admin work rather than proactive selling."
good,"there is great people, I learned so much and I build my confidence, my job was great. coworker is friendly and responsible , I had feeling that was my home."
good,"Company asks a lot of you with low salary, Management is very tough and need training on how to talk to their employees. Not much apportunity to grow."
good,"Company doesn't follow traditional QA practices or processes.  No follow up ,   poor procedures.   Work output of some individuals is low and management doesn't seem to care.   Training very poor.  Documentation severely lacking.  Pay is at the low end of all job titles.  However there are some very good people"
good,"not satisfied with the pay, even after being with this company for almost 12yrs. Looking for more opportunities . Not comfortable with the job security , since Anixter , about a year ago bought out my previous employer ."
good,"No opportunity to move on, salary increase is extremely poor and that doesn't help workers and their families. That's the main reason to look for a different company."
good,A typical day at work is non stop.  Very busy sales office and not one day is alike.  I have learned that one can be patient and persistent simultaneously.  I endorse team efforts and my coworkers share the same spirit.  The hardest part of the job is the constant deadlines which ironically is also my most enjoyable part of the job.  I work best under pressure.
good,working can be fun. the beginning and the end of the mouth is very busy. just the two weeks in the middle is very slow. great team effort wen required but not always helped by the warehouse supervisor. have had the opportunity to finish a nvq level 2 paid for by the company and trained in working in goods in. hardest part of the job is when is quiet the two weeks in the month. most enjoyable part of the job. home time and pay day and wen it busy.
good,"I was with this company for some time and they've been good to me. It is a very numbers driven place that talk about the importance of people, but sure doesn't translate that way. Green numbers first and somewhere at the end of it all, we work with people.  Not a good balance."
good,"Anixter is a well place to work at, not too much of hard working environment. People were easy to get along with & everyone there at the warehouse I was with knew one another."
good,"Phoenix branch."
good,"Anixter is a decent company to work for if you're a sales person...Most of the time (though I've heard plenty of complaints from the sales people too). If you're not a sales person, you have little chance for advancement regardless of how much Anixter touts how much it cares about its employees. "
good,Overall good place to work but opportunities for advancement outside of the corporate office are limited. The compensation is below average compared to other companies of this size.  The company is top heavy and the leadership team is not diverse.
good,"If sales is your forte, Anixter is the company for you!  Inside sales reps work with the autonomy to ""own their desk"" as if it were their own business.  While prevalent at the corporate home office, there is not enough emphasis on back-of-the-house roles on the local level."
good,Very fast pace.  Projects were well planned.  Planning meetings were very informative and kept us on track.  Great team atmosphere.
good,Love my job there.  It was a great experience for 17 years.  I had the freedom to do my job without someone hovering over me.  Not open to new ideas too much.
good,Anixter is a Global Distributor of Networking hardware and Electronic wire and cable.  They also excel in security products.  They recently purchased HD Supply to expand their product line portfolio.
good,"Company was more concerned with form than function. Did not understand that the market set the dynamic for how goods were sold."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Anixter Inc. It's a very stessful environment because of the high quality and production guidelines but relationships you build with the other employees and management make it worth it.
good,"Learned a lot about different cultures, but considering the amount of time that you required to get help to assist clients everything was negative."
good,The company is a fun company to work for. A lot of caring nice co-workers. The only problem is the lack of professionalism in the manager department. They do not follow procedure and protocols like other companies I have previously worked for.It doesn't matter how hard or great you do your job they will give a raise or promotion to someone who are of their personal liking.
good,Able to have broaden my knowledge in quality control and shipping.
good,I would only work here to pad my resume. Not a long term employment opportunity if you're a real salesperson.
good,"Buena estructura a nivel corportativo y excelente disposicion de herramientas de trabajo asi como politicas claras y buen  presupuesto."
good,"Great place to get started in sales. Not a whole lot "
good,"Okay, so basically I work in a warehouse. Now, I don't know how any other branches work, but in a warehouse location, there isn't much room for advancement. I know some people who literally have been a ""Warehouse Associate"" for the last 15 years because there was no where for them to move up to. I have been with the company for the last 4 years. I started in 2015 and in 2019 I haven't gotten much of a raise. I've talked to some of the new employees and sadly they make more than I do with only a few months of employment. If you're looking for money, this is great as a non-full time job, seeing as how you're expected to go above and beyond for little pay. Aside from bad pay, some of your duties can be described as ""easy"", meaning if you know how to do your job they normally leave you alone and you can work at your own pace so long as you meet their minimum standards. You start with 1 week of vacation after a few months and 4 days of sick time that you have to make last throughout the whole year. After your second year, you get 2 weeks vacation, after your third year you get three weeks, and after your tenth year you finally get four weeks. You're honestly better off skipping over this job if you think you're worth more than a measly 14.50. The people are nice and sometimes management doesn't know what they're doing but you have to follow their guidelines."
good,"I liked the project services Division people I worked with, felt like family. I would look forward to working with a group like that again. The team was highly energetic and driven"
good,I really have no complaints about this company. Great work life balance. Great benefits. Clean environment. That's pretty much all I have to say about this company.
good,It was a job that you did different thing daily.  I was out of work for 2 years and Anixter called and I went for a interview.  It was nice but the drive was bad in the winter time
good,"I did like the job that the Temp Service had placed me with, but when my 90  days was up for them to hire me on full time, they didn't want to they wanted to stay at the pay rate I was at but working long hrs."
good,"Nice place to work-aside from having to meet a quota too often, hard work, they could pay a little better with all the work they expect. Overall pretty decent place to work"
good,"Good company, a lot of room for growth and opportunities. Productive work place. Good management and employees. Overall it is a decent workplace environment."
good,"I had the opportunity to meet some interesting people, but they were all depending on the front desk to answer telephones and take messages. After 9/11 most of us got laid-off."
good,"Good Work Life Balance, Not much room to advance unless you are willing to relocate, Job pays a little above what your normal warehouse associates would make but that is only to start off because raises are not god."
good,its an okay job the ceiling for is low for employes. Lunch break is too short and mangement needs help. Some supervisor's don't know their jobs and some group leads are disrespectful. Benefits are alright could be better
good,Very busy environment and excellent training. Room to develop your career but can get a bit political. It was more who you knew than what you could do.
good,"Data entry it was a long day and we had to meet daily quota , was very exhausting at time however it was a great place to work. Very flexible........."
good,Company treats its employees fair and with a great deal of respect. The people I worked with was a pleasure to work with. Great company to work for and I would recommend someone.
good,"Overall Anixter is a good company and the employees are very friendly. There is limited opportunity, however,  for employee development and career advancement. The benefits are not that great, especially where work/life balance is concerned."
good,"Anixter is huge into training, which is necessary to do a good job in this industry. Sales training is super as you interact with all channels of a sales."
good,"Most of the managers treat you well, and the benefits/vacation are good.  However, it seems like many people who work there don't really like their jobs."
good,"I was a supervising lead making great pay and receiving wonderful benefits at Anixter. The downfall of this company is how they preach ""we are a team"", yet the immature operations manager blames every missed order on individuals, rather than team efforts. I was constantly defending my own actions, even though I worked safe, efficiently and ethically. I was blamed on multiple occasions instead of given constructive criticism. Every employee below upper management is treated with disrespect, and was expected the impossible, even though that company does not employ nearly enough staff to handle the amount of orders they receive daily. They are a greedy bunch and all about their own personal commissions and bonuses. I am glad I am gone from that place. Do not recommend this place at all, especially the Mississauga location."
good,Very corporate environment.  Lots of structure and not much continuous improvement.  A good place to begin a career. a a a a a a
good,"Not a climate controlled environment, that is the hardest part of the day. The coworkers and supervisors all jive pretty well. Working here has taught me more about teamwork. The most enjoyable part of the day is closer toward the end of the night, when it starts to cool off and I know I'm about to be done with my work for the day."
good,A typical day was to cut the correct amount of power wire ordered by the client.
good,"Releasing orders"
good,Anixter was a good place to work. They provided me with all of the tools needed to be successful.
good,"Anixter is a great company, I have made a good career with them."
good,"good place to work with start from 9AM till 5:30 PM and american work culture, the hardest part of the job is the hitting the target and reporting the higher management."
good,"Can be a good company to work for, if you can get your colleagues to step up their energy level. Employees are not corrected or reprimanded for their for their nonchalant approach to their tasks. With proper management in place, the company could achieve so much more with the same amount of resources."
good,"Out and in front of customers is where I spend most of my time, most of my other time is spent with the vendors and internal sales teams. "
good,"It's easy to get stuck in one position. Management is a good ol' boys club and if you aren't in the circle there is little to no opportunity to move around or up. That being said, there are great teams of hard working individuals (who may or may not get acknowledged for their hard work) and the work-life balance can be pretty good."
good,"ANIXTER wire and cable is worldwide company ,especially California coast of living is very high but,the hour rates it low they starting $14.00 an hour some place else starting 16 -18 dollars an hour"
good,Lack of hrs and lack of days. We had to work on customer's orders on the daily basics. Anixter have great team work and good supervisors and mangers I'm this company
good,"I worked remotely from my home. The nearest branch location was 140 miles away in Phx, AZ. As a Regional Federal Sales Manager I traveled frequently. Territory included all Federal Government and Military Entities within AZ, NM and El Paso Tx. Including Ft Bliss, Ft Huachuca, Davis Monthan AFB, Yuma Proving Grounds, Kirtland AFB, Cannon AFB, Los Alamos National Labs, Sandia Labs, etc.. Also worked with large integrators within Federal realm. SAIC, Raytheon, Northrup Grumman, Boeing, Verizon Fed, BlacBox etc.. For the most part I was self-managed. Goal was to drive Anixter business thru large integrators via small business set aside requirements. 8a, 8m, Disabled Vet, Hubzone, Women Owned, etc.. Help Contracting Officers and buyers meet there small business requirements while all along driving biz back through large Federal contractors."
good,"good company, good benefits, good people"
good,"Hard work. Job duties were same everyday not much room to learn anything else, although I did ask. Management was not very receptive and sometimes very rude.I had good relationships with my co-workers.The hardest part of the job was when there was down time.I love to stay busy.The most enjoyable part of the job was having fun while staying busy."
good,The coworkers and management at the Conroe center are great. Very easy going as long as you do your job. There is almost no chance to advance here and the pay is not enough to support a family (Single person it's enough).
good,"Enjoyed a very productive 10 year career at Anixter and was promoted to Area VP of Sales. Was asked to move to Pittsburgh, PA to open up the coal mining division, but declined."
good,I was happy to be part of such a great team. The entire office had great energy with a great work/life balance.  I worked there when I was fairly young.
good,Everybody was very friendly and reasonable to deal with. management had some communication issues but nothing negatively affected work on the floor. All over a good place to work.
good,"Anixter is een typisch Amerikaans bedrijf, waar hard werken bovenaan staat. Collega's zijn super."
good,"Typical work day was 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM depending on how busy the day was. Productive, excellent co-workers. Hardest part of job was at times being blamed by customers when product didn't show up at their job site on time due to circumstances beyond your control ie warehouse issues, trucking companies being late or damaging product. Dealing with my customers and earning their confidence was most enjoyable."
good,"I try to enjoy myself during a day of work, organizing my time to attend all demanding of my day. Coaching my team to improve their performance and work hard to improve the business."
good,Empresa en la cual se puede aprender de negociacion y productos.
good,Wish there was more opportunity to grow aside from inside or outside sales roles in my particular location.  Great work life balance and management is very good at taking care of their employees.
good,"•	Update and provide tracking information to customers as well as to internal managers."
good,A typical day at work is very detailed and fast past. Constant work from the sit down and stand up forklifts. Also from the order picker. Co-workers are very kind and helpful when needed. The hardest part of my day is during lunch when everyone is out at my department and i have to keep up with the orders and inventory alone. The most enjoyable part of my day is just being around the guys and working as a team when needed and if not just busting out the work in a very good quality fashion.
good,"Assisting sales team with customer inquiries, returns, lost shipments, back orders, requests for literature."
good,Order picker/ Forklift driver i get Og&e parts from the rack thats been order afterwards completing the order i surrend-wrap and weight the pallet then mark were its going to. its nothing hard about the job just make sure everything done correct and going to the right place.
good,"the market anixter is in has seen tremendous profit fall over last ten years as product has become a commodity.  problems with vendors have gone overlooked too long by C-Suite and now, it is difficuly just getting product into warehouse and out to customer.  this leaves little to no time for selling and quality control"
good,"Numerous ad hoc requests that were always urgent"
good,"Liked working there a lot.  Good upper management at the time. Regular raises and reviews, while fairly treated the entire time I wsas there. I likied it."
good,Good company but not for advancement. Human resource works for the company not for the employees.
good,"They hired a person to replace me during training, so I never had the chance to really make an impact. While I was there they terminated 3 people with over 10 years experience and me after 90 days, I did the best job I could for a new person and I was doing really well. Not a lot of job security here and extremely political, watch out."
good,"The training they provide is fast and effective. There is a lot to keep track of in this position, but you develop a rhythm after a little while. Everyone there is professional and career-driven."
good,"The job is great, but moving up in the company is very difficult, almost impossible. the major major down side is that you get no breaks, (which is completely against the law) they say you can have as many five minute breaks as you want, but they get mad at you for doing so."
good,"Loved working there. To bad all it jobs were gone by the end of 2018. "
good,"Anixter is a  mom and pop culture to a corporatized culture.  Who you work for makes a big difference, but no job is secure that an extra buck can be made by outsourcing.  Who you work for makes a difference as far as the day-to-day experience, but the focus is more on chasing money than quality of living. "
good,When I started at Anixter it was a great place to work. Over the years a shift in management and a lot of positions have been moved to the US headquarters.
good,A very good operation with high expectations of its team members. Highly competent and driven team overall. Very challenging assignments will often challenge your skills
good,I very much enjoyed my time at Anixter.  My division was sold to SBC out of the US and the job basically stayed the same.  Good company to work for and is still around in the cabling field.
good,Overall not a bad place to work.  the training could have been a lot better.  If you ask the same or similiar question too many times they would give you annoyed looks.
good,"A typical work day is come with a positive attitude  and come do your job. I learned how to work different types of positions in the warehouse. Management was excellent always their when you need them. I had great coworkers to work with, they where always there when you needed help. Hardest part of the job was making sure not to make mistakes. The most enjoyable part was working with my fellow employees."
good,"Stated off as a temp to hire, got hired on my 90th day worked my butt off, and just before I hit a year, I was promoted to an operations lead, runnning my own department of about 15 people. Then my manager left and the was no athurity behind me do back me up. Things went downhill, and I was jobhunting again"
good,"Technical resources are a pleasure to work with and accepts recommendations."
good,Very relaxing environment. I enjoy the job responsibilities. It is also very easy to adapt into. I'm a very quick learner so the requirements for the job would be easy to gain knowledge on.
good,Good opportunities to start a career.  Global locations provide chances to expand in multiple geographies.  Diverse business culture offers options into multiple disciplines.
good,learn new things everyday. i learned to work better with children with mental disabilities.
good,"A great, stable company for your career.  Show up each day with a 'can do' attitude and a smile in your voice and the sky is the limit."
good,customer services.Delivery parts to companys. put away and clean up area. make sure they dont ran out of parts
good,If you are in a good market this can be a very profitable company to work for.  They train very well and are the leaders in their industry.
good,"This was a technology company, where I worked as an inside sales person.  I earned a salary + commission and was able to learn about account management, as I was provided with some very large corporate accounts.  I liked the fact that I was able to work independently for the most part.  I also enjoyed getting out an interacting with the clients."
good,"Great day at work , very good management , wonderful co workers and the hardest part of the job is the boxing ."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. Working together as a team was a great part to our overall success
good,Huge team.
good,"On a typical day I personally receive 80+ telephone calls from sales persons throughout the entire United States. Calls from, help me place an order, to my material has been lost in transit, or wasn't delivered on time, to material was damaged in transit. At this point I contact the warehouse to inform them, call and inquire with the carrier about the product being shipped."
good,I love working there it was a great job the atmosphere was right some of the management was real nice the drivers treated me with respect I got along with everyone it was a real nice job I'm no longer there though this is why I'm looking for another job but other than that it was a real nice place
good,"Anixter is the global leader in Wire & Cable sales.Typical work day would be to call your Customers & see if they needed anything that day, send out quotes & generate purchase orders, expedite the order & follow up with customer to see if they were happy with their purchase. Generate monthly sales reports & hit your monthly targets."
good,"Anixter, Inc is a large company. The benefits are OK. There are opportunities to grow within the company. Anixter prefer to promote within rather than hiring from outside"
good,I was happy working for Anixter. Unfortunately with direction the company was going in my department was dissolved. I was able to help the employees that were retained to flow into there new positions.
good,Liked the work environment. Public transportation to the work site was not good. This was also a temporary job. The people were very helpful and friendly. Good training environment.
good,"Run file, match invoice, reply to emails, resolve query's."
good,I have learned a great deal from Anixter. Not all of it is applicable. Sometimes you are asked to do things that you know will not work. Management cares only about the numbers and not future growth. Aside from that it is the second best company I have ever worked for in my long career.
good,Its a cool company to work for..The pay is between $13.00 & $13.50.They are flexible with people and they schedule if your are attending school..Good place to work if your new to the warehouse scene..Supervisors are really easy to get along with..
good,"Work for this company was a great experience . I meet some very good people , I love meeting new people and getting to know then , my clients were amazing I went to my very first buddy baseball game with the center and to see the clients having fun and enjoying the game was one of the most amazing things I ever seen . I've always wanted to work in the health field so that I could make a difference in some way no matter what it was and Anixter center gave me that opportunity and for that I am grateful ."
good,"Anixter is an OK place to work. Benefits are OK, they can't afford vision for some odd reason. Some of the management is a joke. If you get a high level position you might be better off."
good,Anixter was a pretty good job that allowed me to learn a lot and advance pretty quickly. However they don't always give everyone such an opportunity and often an employee is let go before much if any effort was put into help making the employee successful. Management and supervisors rely on other employee's to train new hires and never really judge bad performance on having a good trainer. So some unlucky people get poor training and just don't make the cut.
good,A typical day at work would be receiving phone calls and e-mails from customer's who are requesting quotes or purchasing product. Customer's will check the status of their order or make changes to their order. I started out with this company as a receptionist/ customer service rep and over the years worked my way into a sales assistant position. I learned how to deal with gross profit/ margins and how to process customer's purchase orders. I also gained product knowledge. My co-workers are great and have helped me along the way with any questions I have had. The hardest part of my job is not being able to advance any further when I feel I am qualified for a higher position. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the customer and helping them in anyway that I can.
good,"Changes in corporate philosophy turned the Anixter ""Blue Book"" philosophy of family and honesty first to a numbers driven entity that seemed more interested in call volume than quality. Overall still a great place to work though."
good,"But there sales manager Craig was"
good,Great place to work.  Casual environment and co-workers are supportive and will help get you up to speed.  It takes time to learn the various products that the customers need and their are various resources available to help you learn.
good,"Understaffed and stressful workplace, non stop order processing, quoting, and follow up"
good,This company was very flexible with time. It was a very comfortable place to work. The job itself was good experience. I learned different systems on the computer.
good,"Quality, inventory shipping receivnig working with people from different cultures I love It"
good,"Great company. Competitive wages and benefits with opportunities for advancement, given you are in the right position/market. Has acquired a handful of other companies over the last 5-10 years to broaden it's position in the industry."
good,Anixter is a great company to work at but at times the amount of work asked of the employees is a bit overwhelming given the median pay rate the employees are at.
good,Lots of overtime needed to keep up. Missed out on a lot of family moments that I will never get back. Job was fast-paced. Friendly work environment. Safety was always priority.
good,"A good place to work overall. I had no issues with any co workers as everyone was pretty nice. Clean office, very organized, no complaints other than they laid me off after only 6 months. Why hire someone if your going to reorganize and lay people off?"
good,"I started my career with this company and they were a good first employer. They are willing to train and there are a lot of good people who work there. Moving up is a bit hard because the company has become so large. The culture is good though, really open door which is nice. There is a lot of teamwork dynamic as well."
good,"I would pick orders, put away orders, help others with projects, help out in other departments if needed. Safe place to work with updated fork lift equipment. And nice break romms"
good,"When I began in the late 2000's, the company culture was much more relaxed than other organizations (as per the Blue Book values, people address each other by first name- there is no formal title or ""Mister/Miss."")  That has changed in the last few years as there were acquisitions and a divestiture of the fastener division comprising 20% of the company.  Who you work for plays a big role in how enjoyable the work experience is.  Workplace attire is business casual."
good,I worked with a bunch of great people that would help you in getting your job done for the today they would anybody that would need help and would make sure that you grow as an employee in the company the day would for the most part would fly by
good,Welcoming environment with a very hands off approach.  The company puts a large emphasis on ethics and corporate responsibility.
good,"Great work environment, co-workers are always willing to help out. Everyone is patience with new hires and are willing to help them no matter what."
good,Company in general is a great place to work.there is a few departments that need change in management but overall glad to have been able to learn from the company and grow.
good,"A nice environment with great co-workers."
good,I started in a new position at the company. Gave me a good grasp of how a corporate accounting department worked. Had some great co-workers and management was always nice.
good,early morning staff meetings team leaders n management. ive learned how to properly operate industrial equiptment and help quality control perfomance.Managment changing do to new location with company was challanging ..co-workers at times may have different mode swings but we still were focused on getting the job done.hardest part of the job was not bringing a lunch. most enjoyable part of the job was the work itself.
good,Working here afforded me the opportunity to see how important the wire and cable industry is for the success of other businesses.
good,I operated 2 different departments during my time there. I learned about big warehouse operations. Many of the warehouse associates were fantastic to work with. Management made questionable decisions on how to arrange and support the supervisor level. The hardest part was dealing with a lack of IT and management support for improving the daily lives and jobs of my associates. I enjoyed immensely the atmosphere and comraderie that my departments shared during my time.
good,"I like working at Anixter because I get space to work alone, I can sit and decide when I do my break, lunch, and even head out.  Just make it sure 8 hour"
good,"Excellent warehouse in which to work.  Inventory skills are a must. Organizational skills are a must. Must be strong at working without supervision. Great staff, and clients. I enjoyed my time there."
good,Corporate office environment with approx. 1000 employees locally. Supporting the international company operations. Detail focused with various teams working together. Exciting with alot of opportunities to explore and improve on and various situations that needed to be monitored and attended to.
good,"Empresa com ótimos benefícios, funcionários capacitados e sempre dispostos à ajudar na resolução dos problemas. "
good,During my time at Anixter I met really good people. A lot depends on your manager. In some cases Anixter provides opportunity to work remotely. OK benefits
good,I really enjoyed working with the group I was with but management was unorganized and aloof which caused job stress.  the lack of a work-life balance is ultimately what pushed me away.
good,Happened to me and had to look for new job. I was given a month warning though. I had to apply for other jobs at Anixter like outsiders which didn't bode well with me.
good,This was a good place to work . All about building strong relationships with customers. Expectations were not unreasonable and management works very closely with sales.
good,I planned meetings and was able to interact with a diverse clientele. I really enjoyed this job but my position was dissolved and a temp was brought in to answer phones.
good,"A typical day at work, required me to come in and set-up my work station, ensuring a had all the tools and materials I needed to perform my job, to the best of my ability.  I learned about the importance of customer service, teamwork, and how different functions of a warehouse environment, all comes together.  Both my coworkers and management, did that to the best of their ability.  This made my job easy and at times fun.  The hardest part was if I came in to work, and I didn't have the tools I needed to fully perform my job."
good,"Anixter is a good company to work for. It's a pretty laid back corporate culture and the people are friendly. Compensation is good.  Benefits are good, but less holidays per year than other companies and vacation policy could be better in comparison to other companies. The corporate headquarters are in Glenview, IL which is a very congested area to have to commute to, though there is public transportation nearby, including the Metra. Overall I would recommend Anixter as a good place to work."
good,"Anixter est un fournisseur de produit de communication et de sécurité, câbles et fils électriques et électroniques et autres petits composants qui aide ses clients à spécifier des solutions et à réaliser des achats documentés en termes de technologie, d'applications et de normes en vigueur."
good,"Unfortunately this job lost during the internet phase -"
good,Anixter is willing to give people an opportunity to take on new responsibilities new. It is a great place to grow professionally.
good,"They keep you busy and challenge you.  You have the chance to succeed and they will train you.  They give you the chance to make really good money, the bonuses are paid fairly and on time."
good,"When the organization was Sales-driven, it was vibrant and moved forward.  The past two regimes, however, could only progress by M&A.  Hopefully, the buyers will have a plan other than to divvy it up."
good,"Yard was taken over and job was outsourced to temp agency. Need to be sure the job is steady and remaining there.Would like to remain , but don't feel like the job will be there long."
good,Overall beside some managers the job overall was very good it will teach you a lot so I would recommend it to anybody that is trying to learn the ends and out of receiving/shipping
good,"Good company to work.  Some manager are flexiable on the working schedule, some are strict. There is advance opportunites for aggressive person. The vocation period is longer than other company."
good,Good company to work for. Nice mid level pay. Easy to move up in the company. Weekly pay and weekends off. Very stable company and should be around for lond time.
good,"Sales opportunity "
good,"The job had a lot of good challenges."
good,I enjoyed watching Anixter grow over the years to become a global leader in their market. Many fun people to work with and lots of great customers! Overall I really enjoyed the many years I was with Anixter.
good,"I have gained a lot of experience in a very diverse environment.  I am not just performing Inside Sales for selling, but have gained extensive knowledge in Customer Relations."
good,Login to your work place. Start off by collecting tools you need to prepare for the entirety of the day. Ship orders thru UPS and FedEX. Usually a rinse and repeat.
good,"Honestly, this is a great company to work for. Lots of rewards, room for advancement, and the atmosphere is pretty friendly. It's a very safe and well equipped company, so you wont find yourself breaking your back hand wrapping pallets or using pallet jacks. Nothing but high quality machines to make the work happen a lot faster and safer."
good,"Productive and fun place to work. Productive and fun place, to work."
good,"Please note this is from an Inside Sales perspective and may not be representative of most positions-"
good,"a typical day at work consisted on one thing, packing up material. I learned to manage my time better and stay one pace with my goals. Management is great there but the supervisor i was under mad no efforts to make the job any easier for my team. We were always running out of supplies and supervision was almost nonexistent unless you did something wrong. When you fell under the companies 100% productivity policy you were heavily looked down upon. The other employees that i worked with were very nice for the most part some worked harder then others. The hardest part about this job was doing the same exact, 7 or so, steps for eight hours a day five days a week; its a very tedious job to say the least. The most enjoyable things about this job is that you have the weekends off and they pay every week."
good,"Great place to build a career. You must be willing to work long hours, many nights run past 12am. However, the management team is very supportive and having the respect of your associates is extremely humbling."
good,"A typical day at work for me is very busy, which is great. I learn a lot just from trial and error. Management is very positive and always there to assist and help when needed. Co workers are great, fun. The hardest part of my job is doing a query on payment that was accidentally posted before your'e done applying. Once query is done, you have to tic and tie, The most enjoyable part of my job is applying cash, providing excellent customer service"
good,"Mornings would usually come in and print off any lines that needed picking, and get straight to it. finding the locations and then picking, measuring/weighing the item, and then packing it and labeling. Some jobs used BIN systems which meant that their were many items going to the same place so a pallet would be used and boxes labelled to specific parts of the delivery. Then in the afternoon, there might be some goods inward to locate and put away in the correct location. throughout the day deliveries would be being made and being picked up. sometimes having to sign for a delivery. If I had any questions about the locations of any items or anything like that I could quite easily ask any of my coworkers or management team. Everyone I worked with was very helpful and friendly towards me and hopefully they felt the same towards myself."
good,Working at Anixter was very rewarding. The team members were very helpful and impressed me by the way concern was shown when a member was ill or how everyone rejoiced at sucesses. The management team were awesome and extremely helpful. Always willing to train and provide advice on how one could improve and advance within the company.
good,The workplace culture at Anixter is forward thinking with an adaptive approach to problems.  The environment is quiet making it easy to focus and a lot of resources are available to learn new skills.  When you have a skill that can be used for a task they are open to utilizing it.
good,"Weekly sales meetings."
good,Good experience. Learned during my time with Anixter. Hours weren't good and Glenview is too far for me but it's a good first job to put on my resume.
good,My manager and coworkers are terrific communication is open and I do enjoy working there just would like earlier hours so I can rest and get more stuff done personally
good,"Anixter was a good company. Gave you all the tools to be successful but did not value the experience, certifications and knowledge as they could have.  Enjoyed my Tenure there."
good,"I can't say anything bad except I was sad when I was told I had to go to Optimas.  Quality people.  Very relaxed environment.  People working as teams, not looking for individual glory.  A place I would recommend work at except they are moving entirely to the cloud and  have had to laid off over 70 infrastructure IT people.  CIO is a great guy."
good,Fun place to work with long term employees learning and growing together. Great opportunities for professional advancement. People driven organization.
good,Great 10 years of growth and training to develop the sales skills that i have required to this day. Face paced but always exciting as each day was something new.

good,"•	Responsible for picking material according to customers orders within the picking department."
good,Working at Anixter I was one of many liaisons between the sales reps and the warehouse.  I would take incoming calls to place orders for sales reps selling wire.
good,It hardly felt like work. I was the first one to arrive and the last one to leave.
good,"- Typical day is from 7-4, working on many different platforms. There is a small office area and a large 400,000 sqf warehouse that you cover. Issues ranging from printers and wireless issues to full re-builds of computers and working with a variety of scan guns."
good,"- Using WMS to ship out orders"
good,"In my time at Anixter I was exposed to many different aspects of the business, which help tremendously in overall knowledge of the companies role in the sales channel. I began by helping with administrative work, but quickly began working with large accounts trying to win upcoming projects. Anixter, being an IT distributer, allowed you to work closely with both the manufacturers and contracters, giving you much better perspective of the functionality of the products and services Anixter provided."
good,I work for the company for 8 years. Good people you work with. Supervisor will help if it is needed to complete assignments. You develop relationships with customers picking up parts. Only issue is the pay but great environment.
good,I had my internship at Anixter. I felt very welcomed there. People are so nice and friendly. Management has open door policy. Offices seemed to be a little outdated. Overall - great experience.
good,"Exelente empresa con un buen ambiente de trabajo , buenas prestaciones , buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,A great Company to work for. Anixter has one of the best working cultures I have ever worked for. I would recommend Anixter them to anyone that asks.  They are world wide.
good,Anixter has an overall great work environment but the corporate culture is a little stale. It is a great place to start you career in this industry. You will meet a lot of contacts.
good,"Great Company To Work for, also great environment. Work environment is very good and people are co-operative. One need to speak out for recognition and work assignment."
good,positive work environment with great supervision. I learn new things daily and have the confidence of my supervisors to lead special projects we do with a high dollar amount.
good,"Hours are quite strict, every day from 8 am to 5 pm. Everyone is casual and kind. Work is mostly sitting at a computer all day long. I learned professional skills such as making frequent phone calls to suppliers and how to effectively manage an inventory worth thousands of dollars. Amazing learning opportunities within the company."
good,Anixter is fun and flexible with their employees. Due to cuts in the company there were lay offs a year ago in the office I worked in.
good,"Load/unloading poles, switches, insulators, alien heads, motors etc. Making sure the yard is clean/safe at all times. Having a professional environment is key to a great work place! Which we at center valley do on a day to day basis"

With my new position I learned many new functions of the entire warehouse. I've been treated with respect from my first day of work.

The hardest part of the job is that it can get kind of hectic at the end of the night to ensure that all the orders are packed and shipped out. I love working here and with most of the people I work with. Much to my liking the warehouse has heat in it for the cold winter, haven't worked for a summer yet but they have huge fans and ventilation available for once the heat gets here. The only thing I can honestly say bad about working here is the time that I miss with my son."

I would pick the material from the location and make sure the product was correct and then put the material into the location where either the packer or an aggregator will check the material to make sure if the product was correct and ship it out to where it has to go. I learned about the quality and the quantity of how material is handled in a work place. The management was very kind, and reasonable when coming to situations in the warehouse. The hardest part of the job was the productivity you had to make for that day when there was really no work to produce. I enjoyed the fact of having a work friendly atomosphere, and there was always something new each day."
