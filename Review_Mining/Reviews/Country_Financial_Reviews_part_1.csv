rating,review
bad,"This was the most dysfunctional office I have ever worked in and was definitely not worth the pay cut I took for the opportunity. My husband was an agent in the office and I had planned to become his licensed assistant but the company poached me, which seemed like it would be a benefit to us both at the time. The agency manager was never in the office (always out on personal time, not appointments), there was no training of new agents, the agency assistant did absolutely nothing and was very hostile to agents and staff and and sometimes downright rude to clients, and the turnover was unbelievably high. I was not given much to do besides answer the phone and take payments at the front desk which was a total waste of my very diverse skill set, including past experience in training new employees. It was much worse for the agents as the company only cares about the bottom line and not the people they hire, contrary to all the claims made in the recruitment and advertising. Regional management was terrible too."
bad,"Management enjoyed playing agents against agents creating a hostile and unethical work environment.  i.e. taking well earned clients from agents to give to the cut throat aggressive agents.  Benchmarks that were required for new agents became required again for well established agents with threats of losing their book of business.  What I was told when hired was completely false, it was 10 years of frustration before I got smart and left the company."
bad,"I have never worked in an environment that was so catty and unorganized! Nobody worked together and they were  more concerned with talking about people's business affairs than actually doing their jobs! Made it very uncomfortable, unprofessional, and highly stressful environment! You cant trust or believe even what your boss tells you, DO NOT WORK THERE!!! Even the customer's seemed to go out of their way just to be rude to you! My recommendation would be for the whole office from Sales Reps to Management to be REPLACED!!!!!!"
bad,I would rather work at a gas station than for this company. they do not treat employees well. do not communicate in a timely manner. They do not offer any work life balance
bad,"Unrealistic expectations "
bad,the worst company i have ever worked for. management does nothing to help the employees.management does not care. pto accumulation sucks. having a day off was almost a bad thing because the following day there was SO much work accumulated.
bad,"Too much work and way underpaid. Expect one person to work an entire office alone. Hours are ridiculous and no break time. Only nice thing was holidays off, however they were unpaid."
bad,They are bias and treat women like trash. They do not take harassment serious and they sweep anything under the rug because a woman is the boss there. Do not work here unless you want to be miserable.
bad,"Bad rates make it impossible to stay around but... thats ok because the company doesn't want you to stay either. Market to your friends and family and spend your own money to succed. Its a marketing scam get you to wash out after a year and they keep all your clients. I took time off because of the birth of my son and got fired. I saw 5 people get fired in the year that I was there. I was treated very poorly during training. If your a nieve kid right out of school and don't know any better go and work there, if not you won't last very long unless you keep your mouth shut and work a 14 hour day to make about $30,000 a year after spending your own $ on leads that you can't land because the rates are horrible. When your company constatly brags about financial strength you start to ask how is this strenght attained. By high rates and saving $ by passing business to other agents when you get fired and reduced commissions. There is nothing worse than working a sales job for a company that makes decisions to make your job more difficult not easier, then when you can't make it points the finger at you and says what a bad salesman you are or you didn't use the sales process."
bad,"Avoid this company at all cost.  Used to be a good place to work but since they determined operating costs were too high they have taken to running out long term employees.  Bullying and intimidation by management is rewarded. Many have left and are working with major ins player down the street. HR doesn't back employees and you will be a miserable mess before you finally throw in the towel, just an awful place. Apply here if you have no self esteem."
bad,There are so many places out there to work for go somewhere else. The stress level was so high and HIGH turn over as they are always changing the rules of how much you have to sell. Three strikes and your out. Even if there for years unless you can make it to career rep if you don't make your numbers they will let you go. It is three strikes for the whole time even if there three years if you get three you are done. Nothing can be done with management and he doesn't care either. He will tell you he will pay you for something or pay you back and doesn't. He has his favorite and will let him do anything he wants. I feel bad for anyone that works there for him. Wish the company would of checked out what he is suppose to be doing at least once in awhile. And he was always on vacation when your numbers were due so he says he won't be much help not that he ever was anyway. The clients don't get transferred and go for many months with no agent rather than be given to an agent. The number of agents is low now and I am sure will drop even further. You have a flexible schedule but I found out you really can't take time off work or you will already be behind. Ask how many agents have lost their jobs recently and do your home work on this company or you could get yourself in trouble quick. When was the last time you saw an ad or tv commercial for them? If you don't know who this company is and what they offer how will the people you are trying to sell to. Oh and push all your friends and family until they don't want to talk to you. No family time either so say bye to them and explain to
bad,"Work day was ok until the mico managed our day"
bad,"BE careful before deciding to invest your funds to secure a position with Country. In the Agency that I worked at, they have NOT kept ONE employee in the last 6 years. Financial Reps usually are fired within 1 year because the goals are so difficult to obtain. The goals have changed over the last few years and retention is NOT a priority,managment just wants to keep their career agents happy."
bad,Country Financial hires too many family members of current employees. very little chance for advancement. over complicated systems.
bad,"I enjoyed the aspects of the job, however the office environment was difficult to endure.  I was able to obtain my Illinois Property and Casualty insurance license while employed there."
bad,Went  through 3 CEO's in 15 years.  Had 6 different contracts in same time frame.  Initial manager very engaged.  Subsequent manager not engaged or supportive.
bad,"It's tough to sell when all your products are more expensive than average. If you miss your sales goal expect a $500 to $1000 deduction. If you miss your goal 3 months in a row, expect to be fired. To build enough of a book of business from scratch, to where your contract changes and you have all the personal freedom and flexibility as advertised expect about 4 years of suffering."
bad,First started i was excited to be there. The training was poor no one is on the same page there not even supervisors. Their call quality model is run by one person who is also inconsistent. Management does nothing about employee pains such as call quality issues. Items missing from desks. They do nothing to promote or enforce the so called team environment they claim to have. Every thing you do is constantly watched especially if you report anything to human resources. The schedule changes every 3 months. This makes it impossible to maintain a work life balance. They expect employees to know everything after 90 days on the job. Any mistake gets a formal inquiry by management which is uncomfortable. The 401k match is low compared to most companies. As for pay it us decent however not a livable wage for the area.
bad,Marketing to reach clients. Appointment with clients. Love working with people. Culture does not promote growth. Also Wish management was more experienced.
bad,This company is run by a bunch of chiefs and no Indians.  Why this company is so top heavy and poor performance.  The system is designed to benefit the managers at the expense of representatives which is a sad!
bad,"The Agent was never in, always getting her nails done or going to lunch or on vacation. I could never give the clients an actual time frame of when she would be in,."
bad,"Favoritism is a large part of the work/management culture.  Taking insurance classes does not guarantee advancement, neither does qualifications.  Management is allowed to look past qualifications to accept transfers."
bad,"I worked as an Agent Assistant for a local COUNTRY Financial agency.  They lured me in with promised pay increases.  They worked me like a dog and then refused to increase my compensation as was promised prior to accepting employment there.  Working for an agency offers no insurance benefits, pension or 401K and very low compensation."
bad,"Simply put, there is a reason why they are always hiring.  New employees every couple of weeks and they leave just as fast as they come in."
bad,"arrive, make coffee, turn on computer, check voicemail, check email, call for appointment reminder, follow up on any emails, follow up on calls for additional information needed to complete paperwork, help customers, with billing, questions and taking information on changes to there policies, filing, batch issue pending, open files,issue payments for premiums paid in cash, transmit. clean up of old files. answer phone."
bad,"My typical day was prospecting to new potential clients, while also taking care of my current clients. I had a book of about 250,000 annual premium and was expected to continue to build on that monthly. My manager stopped communication for an entire month, even though I was asking for his help and worked in his office (he never showed up). I made a couple friends that were co-workers, but that didn't make the job any more bearable. The hardest part of the job was planning to get benchmarks, and not knowing if you'd have a job the next month. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you truly help someone understand insurance, whether they bought some or not."
bad,The benefits and the pay were great; but the management was nothing to be desired.  Unqualified mangers were appointed due to tenure but no knowledge of how to lead others.
bad,"The company itself locks you into a department, and, if you are in a service area, do not expect to be allowed to leave unless you can get out within 1-2 years.  After this, it is impossible."
bad,"Country Financial changed their philosophy, in short they overreacted to the DOL ruling, limiting representatives to what we could offer clients, in addition, they changed they also changed the compensation schedule, and removed Fund lineups which left minimal options to offer."
bad,"There is not a ton of upward mobility, and they reserve the right to change both the metrics that you are evaluated on and the available clients you can work with at their will."
bad,No opportunities for advancement. Upper management is not replacing any employees who leave and recently laid off a large number of employees. Those who are still at the company are expected to keep up with impossible workloads to make up for all the employees who have left.
bad,"While you can be successful as a financial rep. It's extremely unlikely. In the year I was there I saw 7 people wash out. Unless you are a master at prospecting you will fail to. Every month I was worrying about hitting my ""benchmarks"" and keeping my job. No one in my area had ever heard of country which makes it hard to sell products with terrible rates. They talk about financial security but if your work there you'll have none. Hard to have financial security when keeping your job is a monthly worry. I saw guys have a ton of success and three bad months in a row and get the boot."
bad,Uncompetitive rates too much management new agents starting out will have a 10% chance of success.There are better jobs with larger Insurance companies
bad,"The company culture used to be less bottom-line.  Now, too many resources are being spent on improvements, that typically don't work.  Although they offer decent benefits, many of the new employees aren't offered the same as longer term employees."
bad,Company is base out of Bloomington Illinois and does not have a presence in the Southeast. Focus is on employees in Illinois. Very bleek place to transfer to.
bad,"Administratively a dead end. Great temporary job. Not a long term place. clock in at 9pm, clock out at 5pm with a 30 minute lunch. Responsibilities include figuring everything out on your own."
bad,Hardest part of the job was that agents were not present in the office
bad,I enjoy meeting new people from different aspects of life and helping them when it is needed. Every client that walks in the doors I want them to feel appreciated
bad,"I left because there was no growth path for older workers.  The company culls many workers before they are 50."
bad,"There was a huge problem with claims adjusters ending up with the same customer and making duplicate phone calls and emails.  The customers would get very angry about that.  Also, the territory managers were not helpful in teaching new employees and avoided answering questions or allowing any job shadowing of them.  A lot of their management staff was very unorganized and unsure of what was going on in their territories."
bad,"Country gave excellent sales training but was the most stressful position I've ever held. Their sales metrics were near unattainable, and if you didn't hit them, they would dock your pay."
bad,The last few years of employment was very uncomfortable as I was expected to do the job of some of the representatives I was assigned to support.  These people would not come into the office for extended periods of days nor would they even contact the assistant. Not happy with the way I was treated when being displaced. They did not even contact me to say good-by.
bad,"Management treats their employees poorly and in turn employees don’t trust management. There is little to no opportunity for advancement. The company lacks diversity. Creativity in employees is not appreciated and frequently punished. If you follow directions, don't ask questions, don't try to improve yourself, work like crazy, and hope to be laid off after you hit 50, it could be the perfect job. The biggest advantage of the company was its stability but with three straight years of layoffs, that can no longer be said. On a positive note, company benefits and pay are very good."
bad,"Plans and conducts sales prospecting by soliciting referrals, developing/leveraging centers of influence and"
bad,This is a small company with small company problems. If you not part of the good ol' boy network then you will never succeed at Country. There is a diversity program but it may just be for show. Racism and sexism is not overt but defined ingrained. This may be the only place where someone with a masters degree and diverse experience is at a disadvantage to someone who has only a H.S. education and has worked only one job their whole career. Many employees stay for their whole career because of the great pension benefits. It's typical to hear of someone retiring with 35 years of service.
bad,In my specific job it is incredibly detail oriented and yet deadline driven.  It is incredibly difficult to work under this type of stress. The software and technology is lacking in such a large company.  Most of the information is still maintained on excel spreadsheets.  Multiple mistakes are not tolerated.
bad,"I was told one thing during the interview process, and found that wasn't true. I was told I didn't have to solicit my friends and family, but I had to provide a list of 200 people I would call within my first year...that is your friends and family."
bad,Women are the minority and Senior Management is mostly men- they do not treat the women managers as equals- they tolerate them.
bad,"Tried it and  didn't like it. "
bad,"Country was a great place to work initially, however, with the new reorganization under the new CIO, things have gone south. Other employees feel less happy, and there is very little direction as far as where the company is going, and what peoples new roles are to be. This creates a very negative environment, and overall, less gets done. Hopefully things will change, but with the new outsourcing vision, things aren't looking great for the company."
bad,"Great cokworkers!  It feels like family."
bad,I do not like selling insurance and it is a numbers game - I do not think they give you enough education. I love my manager and co-worker though
bad,Enjoyable because all the co workers getting along well and the manager really care about his workers and employees.
good,"I worked at COUNTRY for many years I'm just looking for a change and less hours.  I worked in a few areas during my employment there, Actuary, Service Center and Human Rescouces.  I enjoyed every position I had and made many lifetime friends.  I'm just ready to enjoy life a little."
good,"My agents were very hard on me and I very much had to balance between the lines. High stress, Fast paced and little competitions were held throughout the day for the person who could make the most appointments, so added stress there too."
good,Country Financial is not a place that I would refer anyone I personally know to work.  It is a place to work if you are totally out of options I suppose but then I would rather work at Burger King.
good,The company's rating structure is flawed; and there were 5 rate increases in the 2 years I worked there.  The company made the guidelines stricter on top of that.  The particular manager that I had was a micromanager and reminded me nearly every day that my job was in peril.
good,Agent needs strong natural market for success. Management needs to be more involved in agents success and more helpful with coaching
good,"On average, I would say I liked working there just for the client interaction.  Management capabilities were extremely lacking.  All they cared about was the ""bad"" you did and not the good you did.  Example:  I received a call from a client about some property loss.  I did my best to help the client recoup his losses.  In the end, the client was extremely satisfied and even wrote the president of the company about his experience.  I was brought into the supervisor's office a week later.  The unit manager and my supervisor said I didn't try hard enough to get the claim settled in a timely manner.  I was then terminated."
good,"I worked in an agency office with a great financial representative, so I don't have much to complain about. He allowed me 10 days of paid time off, but when I asked to take it- it was like I just asked him for the year off. Keep in mind this PTO comes out of their pocket. I have no opinion on working for the corporate office. I am sure that's better."
good,"The prior manager had a group of agents he liked and if he didn't like you then it was a difficult environment. You are expected to go out and network and find your client base which starts out with your friends and family. They teach you the basics on the products but don't do a lot of training on how to network. If you go into it wanting to be an insurance agent, forget it. If you want to go into it because you love meeting people and are a monster networker and know nothing of insurance this is the job for you."
good,new agents are now in it to win trips not take care of clients . Agents are not taught customer service or how to accurately start policies. You can earn a paycheck for 6 - 9 months and not work
good,"They are very financially sound.  Mostly conservative IL farmers on the board of directors.  They have had some terrible claims especially in the southern states, but they have remained one of the leading companies for customer satisfaction.  "
good,"Key aspects moving targets. Constantly re-structuring, inability to cure small but important key technical and front-line issues."
good,The nature of the business forces you to be on call for what it feels like 24 hours a day 7 days a week.  This is the case for the first 3 years... if you survive past that then I guess life could be better.
good,The people are wonderful but they are overworked.  Still operating mostly in the 20th century...The company will do better by embracing diversity in executive management.  Still operating on the good ole boy network.
good,"The workday consisted of sitting and waiting for customers to come, but the problem is that its location is not ideal for gaining customers. The insurance is excellent for those who can understand it and meet the requirements."
good,"Senior management fails to recognize the backbone of the company, which is the people on the ground doing all the heavy lifting. People work hard, but don't have proper support and framework from management to work smart. Poor acknowledgement of efforts across the board. Senior management, particularly in IT does not understand what it takes to build the various disciplines, but does not hesitate to throw anybody under the bus to assign blame. Bad work life balance for folks particularly in IT. Company has great history, but is going through a touch cycle."
good,"This was an ok place for a new agent. They have about 82% turn over  that I found out after my time there. I saw 3 reps come and go in my tome there, I was there 18 months"
good,"The office was very conservative. If you didn't work in the home offices in Illinois or were on the sales force, they basically could have cared less about you. It's a tough market, so they bend over backwards for their customers (good) and sales force (not so good). The work schedule was nice and flexible. The pay, time off, benefits, opportunity for advancement were poor."
good,I was licensed to sell home and auto insurance.  Walk in and telephone customer service.
good,"Overall, a decent company to work for if you really enjoy insurance sales. The environment was relaxed, and the training on the products was great. Only problem was a real lack of guidance for new sales reps beyond the initial training."
good,a very hard goal to achieve as a financial insurance rep... you have to be a real hustler... work hours are flexible but you better always be selling and looking for opportunities otherwise you just working to build your mentors book of business
good,"On the surface the company wants to be modern and competitive, for customer acquisition and talent recruitment. Unfortunately, it is by nature risk averse, ultra conservative, and mired in clunky processes and antiquated systems preventing it from keeping pace or even catching up to the speed of 21st century business."
good,Loved the flexible schedule.  Focused on P&C.  I wanted to focus on helping clients' financial well being.  You're more of an agent than a Financial Advisor at this company
good,A typical day at work here is very multi tasking.  I have to be on my toes for the clients.  Running the office can be challenging especially when you are required to make so many appointments a week.
good,It's a great business to start off with. The assistants are great as well as the coworkers. We have Monday morning meetings weekly and we do have to fulfill a benchmark.
good,"Open up office at 9am.  Log on to desk top and start taking incoming calls for customer service.  Answer a variety of policy questions, do policy changes, correct billing issues, etc.  Can be quite stressful as you must prepare several types of documents for insureds and their lenders and other third party entities, while helping walk-ins with payments or questions on their policies as well.  That's one of the hardest parts of the job is that you are pulled many ways every day and everything ends up with you at the front desk.  I enjoy the people I meet and many of my coworkers."
good,"Company initiated outsourcing as a means to phase out and reduce overhead and employees. It also used third party vendors which sometimes where not beneficial to Consultants and Employees, loyalty and job security became a factor in the drastic reduction of a comfortable work environment."
good,Country Financial as a whole - great company - push very hard to new representatives
good,"As an external employee. Unsure of culture for permanent employees but a lot of separatism with the company. "
good,"While the management is very available and supportive, the goals and expectations are unreasonable. In the time I worked there (only 9 months) all but 2 of the 15+ people that were hired during my time there were let go. There's high turnover for a reason."
good,Needs more communication and understanding between Management and Employee. Not a lot of room for advancement in my area. Overall it can be an interesting experience.
good,"Looking for a career that offers a big potential financial upside, a wealth of job opportunity and the lure of self-employment? If you enjoy forging relationships and are committed to client service (and can handle plenty of rejection), insurance sales could well be for you."
good,"The grass isn't always greener on the other side. There were a lot of fake people, all vying to get ahead. Pretty dog eat dog environment. A lot of gossip, back biting going on. You have to drink the culture kool aid or you won't fit in. Sucking up is the name of the game."
good,"Leadership at the Contact Center are extremely selfish.  It was a decent paying job with a work from home option.  However, leadership is always wanting more from you."
good,"While working for the company which if fiscally solid and responsible, employee reps barely last two years due to the life policy benchmarks required. Also Career reps are not reimbursed for their time and efforts for assiting new and struggling employees reps."
good,"Poor instability, lacks direction, old-school management that doesn't change with the times. If changes aren't made, the company will be behind the market even more than it already is. Lacks name recognition in the marketplace."
good,"After you call your 300 person natural market, you can look forward to cold calling, or spending a lot of $$$$$$ on leads. The people were nice, while they lasted."
good,"I am glad that I accepted this position and it was a valuable learning experience for me; I wanted to have the experience of being a COUNTRY Financial agent.  I received quality training and the benefits are outstanding.  Agents are allowed to keep their benefits through the end of the month when they are terminated.  However, the culture is a REVOLVING DOOR.  If someone is looking for a job for 6 months, this is the place to go!  "
good,Very low key position. My biggest struggle was not having enough to keep me busy or challenged throughout the day. Wonderful bosses. Couldn't ask for better managers! Great opportunity for those wanting to learn the industry and obtain their insurance license.
good,"They are all about the benchmarks. If you make them your in good shape, if you don't, your one step from out the door. The agency manager that I worked for was a douche. It would belittle you in front of co-workers, he was arrogant and generally a very uncaring type of person.You will never owner  your book here. You can get book given to you though."
good,"A typical day would be coming in to my desk and answering the phones. I would greet all the walk-in customers and help them with their needs and payments, doing quotes, or directing them to the Agent, who is my boss.  I handle the mail and am the office Notary."
good,I was able to build solid relationships with a cross section of teams.  I gained hands on knowledge with various mainframe hardware and software components.  I became adroit in constructing presentations via PowerPoint.
good,"The attorney I worked with/for at the Aurora Claims Office was a wonderful person; easy to work with. Unfortunately, he passed away; my position was eliminated."
good,A typical day has me not seeing more than one client walk in the door. I am responsible for a lot of changes and updates to policies.  Boss can be demanding but easy going most of the time.
good,"The  Personal Lines underwriting department went through a restructure and left only managers and directors in the corporate office in Bloomington IL.  There is little to no advancement in underwriting unless you are buddies with the two managers.   Currently, they are working on a new auto and home system which are not working smoothly and not easy to navigate. They hired entry level underwriters to process the applications through the poorly designed system.  Once it gets fixed which has been taking several years to, I am sure there will be more layoffs.  Managers are only concerned with production and not underwriting.  The local agency sales manager and AVP of sales were great to work with.  "
good,Worked from home had to be available when needed but don't know when needed. Can't here phone when a call comes in customer's are upset due to rate increase on all p & c policies
good,It’s an ok place to work. The best thing about it is my teams dynamic. I feel like there is to many managers and not enough staff. There is not enough resources to complete all goals.
good,"Liaison for County health departments, Adult and Family Services, Services to Children and Families, and Senior and Disabled Services through the administration of Oregon Health Plan."
good,I was very happy with the four different department managers I had during my 5.5 years with the company. The job became very difficult with a new billing system that was less than perfect. I had extensive computer problems during my time there. I retired to help my mother not because I did not want to work there. I really enjoyed my peers.
good,The support at Country is garbage. The multi line financial practice is dependable for sales nonetheless. Depends on what area of the country you are... this is a strong mid-west brand.
good,Country Financial is a great company for someone just getting started in financial services industry. The upper level management team is very supportive.
good,"This place is going to be eventually bought out by one of the bigger insurance companies, they simply cannot keep up with the times."
good,"I received all of my Life/Health & PC licenses as well as my Securities licenses. "
good,"COUNTRY is a very conservative, financially secure company.  They are a little bit behind the times in regards to knowing what their clients want.  Keeping your job and making money is dependent on how many policies you can write.  (obviously, it's sales)  Unfortunately, COUNTRY'S insurance rates are not competitve, so this makes it very difficult to attain the benchmarks.  If you are a well-connected person within the community and have lots of friends and family to sell to, it will be easier for you.  Hopefully some of them will be ok with paying higher rates to have you as their rep, many will not.  If you are not well connected or do not have other professionals sending your referrals, you will have to become connected.  This takes time to build and you may not have that much time.  Bottom line:  I think this is a decent company and takes care if it's clients, but you need to have a large network of people to help get you started.  If you do, you have a shot at making a good career out of it.  If you don't, you will struggle."
good,"interned for 2 very nice reps. it was okay, insurance is not my thing"
good,"I enjoyed working at Country Financial. I worked directly with underwriters and other support specialists. I enjoyed the everyday interaction with my co-workers. I worked with a great group of people. We were all capable of working independently but helped each other out when needed. I saw myself staying there until retirement, but now I am looking forward to new challenges."
good,COUNTRY Financial offers variety of collaborative experiences if one chooses to learn more beyond their current job scope. Many talented people and a good balance of insurance/financial knowledge
good,monthly production goals are difficult to achieve. most financial reps fail after 1-2 years of working with country.
good,"Good benefits, nice hours, and very helpful co-workers / employees to answer any questions you may have. Fun working environment."
good,"It takes a special person to handle the stress and anxiety that comes with being an Insurance Agent with any company. There is a lot of sales training provided, not so much when it comes to product knowledge"
good,"There was pretty good training though it could have focused on different areas.  The work/life balance was great as you do not have a set schedule.  You do get a set salary here which is great in the insurance industry however, the commission payout is considerably low compared to other companies.  You are expected to meet quarterly goals and if you do not meet them consistently then you will be fired so the stability may be a factor here.  However, if you work hard then its a great place to start your career."
good,"Had to do a lot of cold calls and buy my own leads. I had to build my own customer base which a great learning experience but also very stressful.  "
good,"Great people to be around, nice support system, and full benefits. Typical days are busy if you stay focused. I do not want to share any more info about this company, I just want to fill out job apps and find somewhere else to work."
good,"I would say in general Insurance is a difficult industry to get a foot hold. There were many people I knew who didn't get a book of business and a few that did. The ones that did get a book of business are still in the insurance field. There are a lot fewer that made it with out that help. This would definitely be sales position unlike others that requires a certain type of personality in my humble opinion.  "
good,Its a small town and with 2 insurance companies here it is hard to get away from the business.  COUNTRY recently got a new CEO who wants to make us a more modern business.  Much flatter structure.  Still more conservative than some other insurance companies.  Great culture and good work/life balance.
good,"A day at Country Financial is rarely stress free. People with previous experience will have a greater chance at success than someone just getting started. Management is more about helping you achieve goals, and les about monitoring your time. The hardest part of the job is the lack of name recognition. Country Financial is not a household name in the insurance business, and that can be tough to deal with when you first get started. By far the best part of working here is the opportunity to help your friends and families become financially stable."
good,"They help employees with their careers and understand that not all careers are built the same. They have strong training programs, reimburse tuition for education outside of work, have active, well-thought out platforms for mentoring—especially for women and minorities—and provide pathways for non-traditional career paths."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Country Financial."
good,Rules change a lot. Not all policies you write count toward your goal. That is unfair. You work hard but the commission is low. Only one auto and home count per household even if you get umbrella or second home you only get 2 credits
good,"I was just a contractor for Country, good co-workers. Wish I could have stayed within the company, but but contract was allowed to expire"
good,Large company with a small company atmosphere. Management has an open door policy and promotes inclusion. All departments work together to achieve the companies performance metrics.
good,"great job, enjoyed my time here.  Coworkers are amazing but wish I could have made commissions.  great entry level job. if you are in the right market this company makes sense."
good,Great place to start a career in the insurance industry. Very good training and time to understand the ins and out.s Terrible place to end a career....any captive agency is. Becoming an independent agent after a few years with Country is the best way to live out both worlds.
good,"Nice big company, good benefits. You have an opportunity to learn about financial industry a lot. They do have an excellent training system. The company having a huge conventions every year in different locations, with is great encouragement to agents."
good,"Due to the circumstances, I rather not give a review. It was quiet with no-coworkers to discuss work with. Spent most of my work days by myself. There also was a limited choice of where to buy lunch."
good,"I was able to work at Country for 15 years before management changes made decisions to reduce internal employees. Externals were hired to fill many of the rolls, including mine."
good,"i think that if country had some better local management that it would greatly increase the sales and moral in the agency force. "
good,"the place has it's own lunch break room which is neat, but food choice on their vending machines are horrible. on phone all day and nothing else which is sad."
good,"I work with some great people here at, Country Financial. It is a fun environment, and I have gotten to meet many new people. I moved here in February of this year, hoping to find a job more related to my career choice. But this is a great job to have while I'm finishing up school this coming summer in 2017."
good,As a scratch agent you are responsible for prospecting and servicing your book of business. The early part of the career consists of long hours and heavy prospecting for new clients but can be very rewarding if you are consistent and process oriented. I enjoyed most of the time there but you are truly on your own to produce outside of the product training that you receive. The hardest part of the job is the constant grind of prospecting and learning to cope with constant rejection. I did enjoy the freedom to make my own schedule and being rewarded for my work when I was at the top of my game.
good,Country provides a solid opportunity in the classic insurance model. Their compensation plans are very fair. They support with with all of the tools that you will need to succeed
good,It is a great job with a great incentive program. The job is a temp position and the work flow is unpredictable at times making it difficult to keep up on bills if that is your only source of income.
good,"Success is based on your effort.  Helpful work environment, others want to help you succeed.  Endless products and services to provide potential to be successful."
good,"*5 year old insurance company with  a great culture and good benefit plan. Headquartered in Bloomington Illinois, with a large regional office in Alpharetta, GA."
good,"The jobs I worked for with Manpower were phone jobs, data entry, office work, filing typing etc."
good,"Answered phones, gave quotes on insurance for auto and homes. Maintained filing system."
good,"Middle management sometimes finds it difficult to make choices that follow the Company's expressed philosophy of Client 1st, Company 2nd and Agent 3rd. They made an embarrassing decision to support a slacker instead of reward someone for hard work. Surprising, since the Company is strong, middle management weak."
good,I liked working there. Very clean and relaxed place to work. I learned a lot from the insurance industry. My only problem was not being to obtain the Wa license in the time required.
good,"If you don't meet production you are terminated, the timeframe is not enough to get new clients, you have no say in the Commercial that you sell. All training is toward selling, no training on procedure. Allot of the sales don't count toward overall sales which can cause you to not meet production"
good,"This job focused on sales, which was both challenging and rewarding. Learned what tasks really are priorities and how to stay focused on the big picture."
good,"Great management, fun office and I learned a lot about insurance! The hardest part of the job was testing and getting certified in Property/Casualty insurance. Typical day was greeting customers, preparing insurance quotes, filing, phone calls."
good,Working in personal lines underwriting support offers little variety for work that can often be extremely boring. Coworkers are generally focused on work and little fun.
good,"A step up from my other insurance sales position. Good company to work for. Didn't like the 10x10 space for your office, but that was minor inconvenience compared to being out in the field selling"
good,"It was a pleasure working as a team, ensuring our clients have the best the industry has to offer for insurance and financial management."
good,"Good company with good values, but company vision seems to change dramatically every few months, causing confusion for the agency force on where the company is headed and what type of business to target. Great place to start to learn about selling insurance and financial products, but may not be the best for long term career. Job security depends largely on ability and desire to sell life insurance."
good,This company has a good platform for multi-line representatives to service the needs of clients.  Ease and flexibility with schedule is another positive.
good,"This is a good job for a financially minded person with an open schedule to see people on weekends and evenings. That may not be beneficial for all, however the staff was nice and respectful."
good,"They have a great internship experience with leaders to show you the in and out of a large broker dealer. You can expect to be given real life scenarios, participate in a case study competition, and network with many. There is a lot of pros to this as it is a great company and it is beginning to change the culture to keep up with the fast paced generation Y."
good,"Typical office assistant job, learned many things about insurance in general."
good,It was nice learning experience there.  I did manual and Automation testing there
good,The management is very helpful and the company is very loyal.  If you're interested in getting into the business Country Financial is a great place to look.  They train you and get you up to speed so you can grow your business.  The job does require dedication and you put in some long hours.  The payoff is you get to help people and make money doing it.
good,This company invests in their sales employees and has strict guidelines and expectations for them. As for administrative personnel they are responsible for a lot more than job description States.and are not.compensated accordingly.
good,As an intern my responsibilities grew as I learned about the company and industry.
good,On a typical day at work I make appointments for financial represents all over the United States. It requires good communication skills bother verbal and written. My co-workers and I get a long very well. My supervisor is such a sweetheart but also has high expectations which is very important. This job has really helped with my communication skills. 
good,Company has repeatedly proven to care are about its clients. Manager goes above and beyond when helping agents work with new products and clients.
good,"I had the one supervisor in customer service that was unprofessional. He's gone now but I wish management would have dealt with his attitude. He was long time employee and ex-military."
good,Country Financial is a good company to work for. My boss was an awesome manager and took good care of us. I however just did not enjoy selling insurance. This is nothing to do with the company as they were good.
good,It's a nice place to work if your licensed for insurance. I was just looking for part time mon-wed. It was hard to stay because I'm not licensed. Everyone is friendly
good,"Over the years the company is going into a different direction, mainly all web based, therefore, the need for employees in field versus the main 3 locations they have set up to be the ""hub"" is the biggest change. My job title has been eliminated in the field have relocated new hires in the 3 hub locations.  Benefits are great along with the pay i have received over the years, there is room for advancement again if you are in the 3 locations otherwise no room.  The displacement, reorganization, elimination whatever the company calls it always happens in a span of 5-10 years, never fails."
good,"A typical day at COUNTRY consisted of answering phone calls, sometimes up to 30 or 40 daily.  There were also daily and weekly deadlines to meet.  "
good,I was fortunate to have a great mentor and friend in my boss at COUNTRY. She taught me everything she knows about insurance and made it easy for me to ask her the right questions about the job.
good,"Team atmosphere.  Unfortunately, Minnesota division was closed."
good,"Employer liked to keep bus, but never had work to do.  employer never showed up. he was always gone."
good,"Customer service and filing claims write new business."
good,I enjoyed my time at Country and was disappointed to leave the company but it was a struggle to make it as a new agent and kids. Thats why I wish I could have started earlier in life.
good,A great place to work if you are highly motivated and committed to your clients. The best part of my job was knowing I was able to offer assistance to the agency and its clients to provide quality insurance and financial security.
good,"As a Financial Rep you have a great deal of freedom in how you approach your job.  This can be a blessing and a curse.  It's very easy to simply decide not to go to the office today despite knowing you need to.  That said, if you are willing to get out and meet people and talk to them about insurance you can do well."
good,"COUNTRY has great benefits!  The people are amazing.  I've made life long friends.  School and text book reimbursement if you get a C or above in each class."
good,"Country offers flexible work schedule, as well work from home.  Country has good benefits.  Country's focus is on the one true customer experience."
good,"I enjoyed learning the auto insurance business."
good,"Good training, solid management, excellent support system.  Company has a strong foundation within leadership.  Focus on service and serving clients is admirable."
good,Was a great place to work. The pace was very slow. Designing for them always took very long to do. Just getting through all the people who review your work was very long and tedious. But everyone was nice and the place was as well.
good,"I liked the office atmosphere. Good boss. I liked talking to the clients. I had to make cold calls to drum up business after office hours, this was the hardest part of the job. Calling people at home usually during their supper time."
good,"I enjoyed the culture, and the mission  of the company. there was continued education available , paid time off and a great benefits package. I found that the reps could be very caddy and that management at that time was just as bad. Unprofessional, and inexperienced."
good,High demanding but rewarding company.  Auto and home insurance is very competitive. Life depends on the client. Retirement investments are okay. The home office provides lots of assistance for any question you have. Great support group.
good,"Great company to work for especially if you work in the home office claims dept.located in Bloomington, IL.Country is an excellent company. Benefits, pay and advancement opportunities are tops."
good,Work with clients to help them meet their insurance needs. You work with other agents from many different backgrounds. Meeting life insurance sales goals can be a struggle. Lots of flexibility in your schedule.
good,"I had different roles at COUNTRY but they were all client facing like my other jobs I have had. I felt valued in my work and my managers were able to offer more project and training opportunities to help me help them.  I couldn't say enough good things about the co workers and teams I worked with. Although, answering several hundred calls and letters a day was exhausting at times, I still felt appreciated my company and the clients.  The hard part was moving up or around the company. The work can be complicated so co workers rarely moved around to get retrained and management stayed long term as well. In so many ways it was a good thing but then loyalty created stale environment too.  I would have liked to been able to do part of the work I did there as a telecommuter for a more flexible schedule but the work served it's purpose and I am grateful for the experience."
good,"Good company to work for. Quality training . Good name in the Insurance Industry, Company treats their employees well"
good,overall country financial is a great place to work if you enjoy phone sales and have a strong natural market. I was very successful there but did not like working late in the evening on a regular basis.
good,COUNTRY is a conservative company that tries to do the right thing for its customers. The culture is even keel and steady without too much discomfort. It has been a good place to gain a variety of experience.
good,"Digital ID Card"
good,"I was with Country for almost 5 years and I loved ever min of it. I wish I was still there but after I moved it made it hard. For two years I drove an hour to work and an hour home, it just became to much but it was an amazing job! My boss was seriously the best ever!!"
good,The best part of this company is that you look out for the best interest in your clients. I worked for an agent for 2 years and lot. The agents generaly want the best for their clients.
good,I learned how to work in a fast paced work environment while paying attention to the needs and solutions to clients issues.  Management offered great assistance to help develop employees professional skills.
good,"Assisted agency manager in managing and maintaining Excel workbooks, submitting insurance agent statistics of work, reconciling monthly bank statement and maintaining petty cash, ordering office supplies for all agents and assistants, communicating with off-site offices connected with agency,"
good,My typical day was from 9-1 M-F. I learned the insurance rules when it comes to home and auto. The management was friendly and eager to help me with ay questions that I may had. my coworkers were friendly also and eager to assist. the hardest part of the job was working with my employer because he was unorganized with his clients documents. The best part about the job was they allowed me work around my school hours.
good,I've found COUNTRY Financial to be a fair company to work for with a value placed on work/life balance as well as diversity in the workplace.
good,Country Financial is a good place to work if you are interested in working in the corporate insurance industry.  It is a big enough company where there is a few possibilities for advancement but it does not offer as many opportunities as larger companies.  It does have great benefits but you feel like just a number in the crowd.
good,Typical day at Country Financial is full of great challenge and stress. I have learned how to leave my job at work and don't take it home with me and how to respect and don't take things for granted. My Manager is cool but upper management is is strictly corporate. The co-workers at Country Financial makes coming to work real enjoyable and fun. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the financial rep but it all so enjoyable to see them happy when they commission is paid out correctly.
good,Using networking and referrals to build a client base. Cross selling of insurance products to build your business. Meeting quarterly sales goals to ensure you're on track for conversion to independent insurance contractor.
good,"Great place to work with a strong emphasis on serving the customer.  Clear vision provided for employees, and the organizational culture is strong.  Good people."
good,"Good place to work, management was available for any questions or concerns. Work week was 40 hours. I worked for an agent in Urbandale Iowa on 86th street."
good,Typical day at work involves servicing current clients and prospecting for new business. Management does a great job in keeping you on task and training is definitely a plus!
good,"The workload varies depending on storms and seasons. We tend to get very busy when hail season and during heavy snowfalls. Once you get the hang of it, the job is easy to navigate and you learn to handle claims completely on your own. The town is very small, I would not recommend for those who have not settled down and for those looking for a fun busy place to live."
good,COUNTRY Financial offered a great opportunity to learn and sculpt my knowledge of the insurance and IT industry.  I am proud of my service there and the way the company treated me.
good,It is a great place to work. However there was no training to prepare me for what we realistically had to do. Job shadowing would have been great.  The manager was awesome but didn't make time to meet with potential clients.  I had to wing it from the moment I got out of training.
good,Strong work ethic with all employees.  Manager keeps everyone up to date and competing in the market place.  Weekly sales meetings for new ideas and accountability.
good,Great place to work. Good learning opportunities. Collaborative environment. Good exposure with Senior leadership team. No room to accommodate missed targets. Highly competitive environment.
good,"This was a fun job regarding community involvement, business memberships and networking events. They offered flexibility and great rewards for exceeding goals."
good,"The responsibilities of one's position is clearly defined and everyone plays their role to keep things running smoothly.  I walked in knowing very little about insurance but the training is excellent.  Nothing is typical since every customer, policy, or claim can be different but this allows employees to think outside the box to provide the best solutions when an issue arises."
good,Provide insurance and financial review to consumers. Actively market company products. Attended networking events and also cold call to obtain business.
good,It is a great environment to work in. Very rewarding as well. We are an expanding brand. Long hours but you get to help many people.
good,Perfect atmosphere to hone your work ethic. Very organized work place. Very helpful and approachable upper management
good,"I take time out of my day to make phone calls and schedule customers for reviews with the agents."
good,Typically we were in our own cubicles making calls to people and it was cool. I loved the fact that on Tuesdays and Thursdays we would go for walks around the building. I really enjoyed my time there.
good,"Country has potential to be a great career. However, it is very competitive. It is hard to get ahead, but if you do, the earning potential is unlimited."
good,Competitive company and industry to work in. Lots of training provided but you will need to work very hard at getting leads.
good,COUNTRY truly cares about their employees but their standards are very high and there is a decent amount of turnover as an Employee Agent. My manager was very helpful and easy to work with and talk to.
good,"Based on my position there, I was able to network with several other people in different departments and job shadow to learn of their roles. My supervisor encouraged this, and encouraged me within my job and career pursuits. Encouraged additional training, and education, hence the AINS designation."
good,"Claims dept was great place to work.  Good benefits, great people.  Very stressful during storm season, but everyone helped everyone! A family atmosphere."
good,"The company is very goal driven. The support both on the client and employee side is amazing. If you are looking for a company that will support your dreams, I would strongly recommend Country Financial."
good,"as a field underwriter I set my own schedule and pace. I worked with the Federal Crop insurance section of underwriting which included agent training and certification and working with crop claims. I also did commercial underwriting for farm and business risks. I traveled Washington, Oregon, Nevada and Alaska  preforming field underwriting. I enjoyed the position as I was given a company car every year and full expense account. No really bad things to say about the position except explaining the companies position to the  customers which just had a large (1,000,000.) loss and trying to keep them as a client."
good,"Great People, great team! They are wonderful to work with. "
good,"Excellent place to work. Benefits are very good and decent raises every year. Management listens to your concerns and are very friendly. "
good,"my contract is about to end and the challenges, work environment and co workers helped to grow in my career."
good,"Good insurance products but terrible investment products."
good,"Very diverse place to work! Nice people with different backgrounds, and different stories. Everyone is lots of help and are very friendly! Spent a lot of time in-and-out of the work-space!"
good,"Yeah, so it's the Insurance industry.  That means there are a lot of numbers and some of the jobs in it are kind of a grind; if you don't like that I'd steer clear."
good,"Wonderful company to work for. Schedule flexibility is amazing. Your job security depends on your sales production and if for any reason you face a family emergency, your job security is jeopardized."
good,Great company with great training paid for by the company. Great co-workers & down to earth mangers! Salary plus commission plus bonuses & chances to win all inclusive trips on the company!
good,I have been treated very well by my boss. The company has been good to work for and I have enjoyed work there the last 8 years.
good,"Its been very good experience with this organization such a great job culture and management."
good,"It is a great place to work, but the upper management is heavily biased AGAINST internal employees. They would prefer to have nothing but external contract employees overseas."
good,"A typical work day is answering in between 40-70 inbound calls.  I answer those calls plus I answer questions from internal teammates if they have a question about how a process or proceed is worked.  "
good,Country Finanacial is a good company to work for however I am looking for something new that is more of my interest. I enjoy the medical field and would like an opportunity to work in these area of interest
good,Country financial was a good company to work for. I had a unfortunate personal issue that required me to move out of state. The managers seem to truly care about the agents.
good,"Environment encourages collaboration and fun.  The company is customer centered and all projects are focused on how it will impact the customer.  "
good,"Great manager and people. Loved it, moved out of state and couldn't transfer as there were no locations available. Must be self-motivated and able to multi-task."
good,"Good place to work.  Many changes and promotions over the many years of service I have. ."
good,"In this sales position, I was able to interact with many people to help them find the appropriate insurance and financial solution.  It was fast paced and exciting.  The most difficult part was the challenge to meet sales goals: ""You're only as good as your next sale"".  Overall a great place to work if sales is your fortay."
good,"Slow paced with a focus on customer service, with a very family friendly vibe. Wonderful place to be apart of, and would recommend to any friend or family member."
good,"This company provides excellent training for its call center employees. In fact it was the most training I've ever received at any job, ever. The atmosphere is pleasant, the work is rewarding for the most part and varies depending on the type of calls you get. Did not like the call center aspect of being very limited to off-phone breaks, and did not like the way they graded the calls--felt like I was penalized for being friendly and taking time with the customers. Otherwise this was a great place to work. Pay and benefits were very good, and there were opportunities for advancement in the company."
good,Always a great day to work as a team. Having trust worthy co-workers. I learned alot about Insurance. Most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with customers.
good,Most enjoyable part of job was working with my clients. Most difficult part was instability of a steady income. Fellow agents and co-workers were a great help with training.
good,"There is not enough time to build a solid business, It's really an industry problem. "
good,"Very Flexible, the sky is your limit. Excellent Future, very highly rated company in the financial world. Would recommend it for any one who is interested to work in the insurance industry."
good,Excellent client focused company that values it's employees and client relationships. Trusted Advisor with High Integrity. Delivers a excellent client Value proposition.
good,"I would not recommend this employer.  It has, however, been years so perhaps the culture is better now but at the time it was an uninspiring place to work."
good,A fair and reasonable workplace.  Had freedom as I was my own boss.  Received very little oversight and had free reign to run my business as I saw fit.  Excellent starting package
good,"Great internship while in college.  I was exposed to a wide variety of event/program planning, execution and reporting.  Highly recommended.  The team is great to work with."
good,Great place to work and gain professional experience. I would stay there forever if I didn't have to relocate. The recruiting department had a great team and I loved the corporate culture. They emphasize work life balance as well.
good,Working for 2 financial reps and enjoy what I do.  Enjoy working with all the clients and being able to help and assist them in anyway possible.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of answering all phone calls, taking all payments, forwarding all payments to home office, making changes for clients and helping with all of their needs. The hardest part of the job for me was the overload that you would have some times but you just have to take a deep breathe! The most enjoyable part of working at Country Financial would be the relationship I built with clients!"
good,constant change to production requirements made it stressful and difficult to keep stress level down and continue to pursue constant employment with them.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of answering phones, customer service, making appointments and filing.  Loved working there but needed to relocate due to husbands health."
good,It seems like everyone is nice and helpful and the company and management truly care about employee development.  I learned more working at COUNTRY Financial than I did in college and appreciate all of the opportunities I received.
good,typical call center customer service job but not as bad as other call centers. Hours aren't great. Pay is ok for the work. People are great. Good company and management.
good,Just a great place to work.  Friendly people to work with.  Client a super friendly also.  The locating was good.  Very clean and girls in Farm Bureau very nice.
good,I worked for two Country Financial Insurance Agents. I loved working there and would have loved to stay but they had no openings. They both said they would love to have me work for them but unfortunately no openings. They would have to let someone go that's been there for years. Both are giving me a referral for job hunting.
good,"New way of designing, good people to interact, team collaboration,  enjoyed weather and work environment. Design and develop to meet the goals and tasks assigned."
good,Best part of crop adjuster was meeting new and very pleasant people and knowing that I was helping them with their financial securities during a time of need.
good,Country was a great company to work for. My manager was one of the best men I knew. His integrity for doing the right thing will be something that will always stick with me.
good,"Great place to work. In charge of yourself so if you produce, you thrive. If you do not produce, don't expect to be there long. To much emphasis put on life insurance. People who have money typically don't want the person they get their car and home insurance through to also be their financial guy."
good,"Country Financial provided a positive work environment that supported the professional development and continuing education of its employees, and contributed to community service."
good,"Good place to work. Doesn’t feel like a big place, CEO and other management are reachable. Good life/health programs offered free or low cost. Values are strong."
good,"Great, solid organization with wonderful people and strong leadership. Hours are long, and much autonomy exists. Goals are easy to understand, and expectations are set and achievable. Compensation is fair; advancement opportunities are not always clear from a pathway perspective."
good,"Great company, but I was hired as a part time employee, and thought that would be alright with me. I do not qualify for benefits and need to make more money. But things have changed in my life, and I now need a full time job and would like, if possible, a 401k."
good,"Good to See that to providing the positions,also brings the new opportunities,make it continue all the time,thank you."
good,I have worked at COUNTRY Financial for 16 years and the main reason is the culture of the organization.  Great mentors that helped me grow my career and learn new things.  Our passion for helping clients achieve financial security is real and honest as is our recruiting process.  Work/Life balance is very important at COUNTRY Financial.
good,"Just make sure you  are ready for an outside sales position, people don't come to you looking for insurance, you must go to them and talk  them into the sale."
good,"Very professional office, little room for advancement. Training and testing are a everyday task. A lot of financial and insurance information to intake."
good,"Your day, from start to finish, is prospecting and servicing clients and potential clients. I learned more about invetments than I ever thought there was. This job is heavy on time management skills, and self influenced individuals. The other reps in the office are nice, but they all run there own business too, so they ae also busy. The hardest part of this job is building a clientel, so make sure that you have a very large number of people you know, and who will support you in your business as well. The most enjoyable part is the freedom within once you have spent the first 5-6 years building the business."
good,The work environment is great! Everyday you learned something new and it really took teamwork to make thing run smoothly. Communication is so important too.
good,"Country is a good solid company with good benefits and training."
good,The job was challenging and kept me going. I learned new things every day! The company is very flexible with personal needs and time off requests. The benefits are outstanding.
good,Great company and great people to work with.  It's just tough to get the Series 6 and 63 state exams passed within 90 days of your start date.  It was a great opportunity.  Just not enough time to accomplish such an arduous task.
good,"The conventional day consists of prospecting via telephone, cold canvassing and networking."
good,"At this employer I worked part time while in school for my medical assisting program. It was a very quiet office with little customer traffic, most instances all issues were handled over the phone. I got to meet a diverse crowd of clients."
good,"I loved working in the insurance field.  I especially loved taking care clients needs, and helping them solve their problems.  The insurance field is wonderful career, processing claims and helping clients in their time of need is what I strive at."
good,"Very nice atmosphere and people. Liked the hours, pay, very challenging work,"
good,"Good pay and benefits, but small office so there was no room for advancement unless relocation was possible."
good,COUNTRY Financial is a great place to grow your career. As one of the few companies that still offers a pension it also stands behind its commitment to financial security for its employees and customers alike.
good,"Very good company to work for.  The training for a Financial Representative is very extensive. It incorporates a week of training at Home Office, Every day is  long day of training, studying and role playing,"
good,"Team members across the company lend their efforts to help meet goals and objectives.  When in need of answers, support or assistance, other departments and teams are willing to pitch i and help you achieve the assistance you need to be successful, to resolve issues or streamline procedures."
good,"I love Country, and even when I no longer work here I plan to keep my policies with them."
good,"Opportunity for growth. "
good,"Flexible hours, Fun work place, co-workers, boss and clients were all very easy to talk to and get to know. all employees made the work place feel like a second home, always there to help with anything and everything you needed"
good,It was an enjoyable place to work that was challenging and rewarding. It was obvious that you made an impact every day. The management promoted a great culture and hopefully that will continue.
good,It is a good place to work .  But for me selling insurance was stressful and not my forte.  The people wete great!  I learned a lot about myself and the job.  It is a great place if you like quick-paced work and like to sell!
good,I enjoyed the overall learning experience with Country Financial. The Job atmosphere was great the people are fun and the opportunity is definitely a great one
good,Amazing staff and great benefits. Company worked great around busy schedules and made work environment fun. Participates with programs that help local community.
good,"So many wonderful, friendly people.  Great benefits and salary was decent.  Days were busy, but never overwhelming. I loved working with all the agents, and the majority of people at corporate were just super.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy policy holders which was a rare thing and I saw it as a challenge. You can't go wrong working here."
good,Great company to work for. The management was awesome. The training sessions were great. I wish i could have obtained a full time position.
good,•Executing phone calls to prospective clients and follow up with current clients to resolve any outstanding issues.
good,Unlimited opportunity for people who are not interested in a 9 to 5 workday and do not want someone else to tell them how much they can earn. I have seen plenty of people quit over the years but it is not because training and support was not available to them. I think any sales job has a certain amount of stress but that is why they are high paying positions.
good,great company with great culture - highly reccommend - I feel like Country truly cares about not only their employees but also their customers and they want to take care of both equally.
good,"I'm in a fun area of the company where I get to support the growth of our field force.  Talent acquisition is something that I'm passionate about and COUNTRY has afforded the opportunity to continue to hone and perfect my skills. Coming from the staffing world where I thought we had it good, COUNTRY has far surpassed investments in technology and resources from my previous experience.  This is a company that not only says they want to hear your voice, but they truly mean that.  Of all the great things about this company, having my voice heard, respected and wanted has help solidify coming here as my best professional decision to date.  I know all areas aren't equal, but mobility in the company is not only possible, its encouraged.  Get into this company and see where you can go, you won't be missing out."
