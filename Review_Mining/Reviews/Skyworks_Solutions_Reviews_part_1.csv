rating,review
bad,Horrible supervisor on B2 shift.. supervisor has the worst people skills worst possible boss I've ever had. very lazy coworkers!!! The workers that do work hard never gets the recognition.
bad,Their expectation is high and don't pay enough. Working 24/7 and still is not enough. Your work never is appreciated and always managers take advantage of you and get  the promotions and biased and give the promotions to those who don't deserve it
bad,"This company does not care for your health or your well being. They pride themselves on growth and integrity, but they only use their new hires. There is no such thing as growth with this company, they want to keep you level 1 tech the whole time you are there. They take advantage of hard work, the job requires repetitive work for 12 hours. Your body WILL take a toll... They abuse people’s bodies... in the sense that they just use you for your god given body for their companies annual income. DISGUSTING COMPANY"
bad,"Management is awful.  Fab workers treated like zoo animals.  When I first started,  the company was great.  It declined every year since then.  I would not recommend this company to my worst enemies."
bad,"Unless you know how to suck up to the right people, good luck. You can work hard but it doesn't matter because those that run the show will only find a way to kick you out when they can. The supervisors and leads don't treat people fairly."
bad,terrible atmosphere with long going issues not being taken care of. management and HR tended to take a blind eye to personnel issues. harassment from fellow employees was very common and not taken care of in a professional manner.
bad,"There are no enough negative words for the management here. No technical background, yet make all the decisions without any input from below. They are constantly slashing employee benefits to save costs."
bad,"Skyworks needs to work on who they select to be shift supervisors. Presently that seems to be their glaring omission to getting business done."
bad,"long hours, draconian rules set that no one follows but acts as if you will get in trouble if you dont. It was a good a job to save a little money working graveyard, but thats it."
bad,"I myself love the job. I love everyone  there, we help each other no matter what. Basically the shift itself, we bond like a family. Every time anyone has trouble with something, there's always someone there to help. The only downfall is the management itself. They do not acknowledge how much effort the employees put in to reach their daily goals. They push and push and never see that we all work hard. The only thing that would come to their attention is when something goes wrong. No appreciation whatsoever not even a thank you. Very disrespectful at times, no one says anything because people have families to take care of."
bad,"The best thing about working here is the schedule. You work 12 hours during your shifts but you have 3-4 days off every other week. You also meet a lot of great people who make working there easier. However you will see the organization and communication problems when you start. Management are constantly breaking your back on multiple things that does not make sense. And when something does go wrong that it's out f your control, they seem to punish everyone. Promotions aren't worth the pay or the hassle. You get not only what you use to do but a whole list of new things you are constantly being pressured in doing. While you are hustling, you can see that the supervisors are just outside smoking for most of the shift. I didn't know that supervisors and up have unlimited smoke breaks. But they do know what you are doing at all times because the place is full of cameras. They see your every move and one supervisor dedicates his time by viewing or walking back and forth with clipboard in hand waiting to talk down to you while waving his power around. Don't waste your time unless you absolutely feel there is nothing else out there."
bad,"pay is at the lowest end of the scale, no advancement opportunities. The company likes to hire managers from outside. Lots of turnover. I've never seen such a high percentage of engineers leave a company as have in the past year."
bad,the Woburn facility is not managed well. they refuse to spend money on automation to reduce scrap. Lots of incompetent people in multiple positions of authority
bad,mal ambiente de trabajo... acoso laboral en todos los sentidos y favoritismo
bad,"Las evaluaciones anuales para los aumentos son ridículos de 2 a 5 pesos por año y para ganar una vacante en una posición mejor es casi imposible, en donde está su Lema de apoyarte si quieres superarte? Es pura Basura. Además de Nos Han quitado muchos beneficios como el bono anual de producción, el derecho a la posada navideña, bonos de turno nocturno, los sueldos están muy baratos ."
bad,The co-workers are friendly but you need to watch your back; even when you go with the flow.  Safety is overlooked at times.  Engineering and management need to work better together.
bad,They could not determine what the proper staffing levels were so layoffs were announced several times is a short period of time so no one really knew how safe their job was.
bad,Management needs a reality check. They just care about the stock holders. A lot of micro managing. They allow people to slack off and reward them for doing a good job. Then the hard working people have to pick up the slack and get treated bad.
bad,"In the morning I would come in and get the pass down from the night shift of what tools are working and what the work load was like the night before. Then I checked the tools to make sure they had all their chemicals filled and were ready to go. I would spend the rest of my day loading and unloading tools with product and organizing the product so that the proper layers were done in a timely manner."
good,This place is trying to make itself Intel Jr. I ran 3 tools that metallized wafers made of silicon and GaAS. Sputtering was a new skill that I had never done before and for that I am thankful of the new skill. However the management team didn't seem to talk to each other and I'd get different instructions on what to run. I felt micromanaged to death.
good,"No or low raises annually, No overtime. No communications or clear future advancement. Not a lot of directions more reactive than proactive. Treatment of employees can vary vastly. Coworkers can be pleasant or unpleasant depends on personalities, communications and work relationship."
good,"Shift supervisors have been there too long and are just getting a paycheck. If you like to be lazy, well you can't be fired. If you like to work hard, you will get promoted but the pay is not good. This place is for people who do not need to excel but you will keep your job."
good,"Skyworks Solutions is a solid place to work in terms of work/life balance as an HOURLY employee. It is a decent workplace in terms of learning more about your profession. Depending on who you work for in the company, it can either drain the life out of you or be something to look forward to on a Monday morning. Compensation needs a lot more attention. I was rather surprised to see the company doesn't honor some glaringly expected holidays (i.e. Martin Luther King Day). As much of an impact as MLK had on our history, I'm shocked Skyworks Solutions sees it as any other day on the calendar. "
good,working hours were 12+ too long and stressful. Not many breaks given in betwee times. Constant flow of work and did not stop. you get more days off after working many hours per day.
good,"The environment is extremely fast paced and you work in an environment where the expectations and goals are set to standards that are almost and sometimes unachievable and unrealistic.  There was no bonus paid out in 2016 to any employees because the corporate goal of accomplishment the Annual Incentive Plan was set to high and in 2017 most businesses fell very short and didn't reach the goals and at least some got a little bit of bonus but not the target amount when the company is saying how much money they are making and the stock went up to $117 at one point.  The employees work extensive hours to not get rewarded and the pay is so low and not really market rate.  The best part though is the people are really awesome and make the difference.  There are super intelligent hard working, dedicated, and fun employees that work collaborative and are really down to earth.  There are so many PhD's but you would never know who is or is not because of again down to earth.  Loved the people and sense of humor and professionalism."
good,"I enjoy working here, not exactly what I was looking for the work environment"
good,En algunas areas es un desorden del supervisor para abajo.

good,Individual oriented work culture. Fast pace environment. Not that challenging. Health benefits are not that good. No over-time working hours. Could be improved.
good,"Typical work day is pretty much go to your work station and get going to help the work flow of the next area."
good,"Isolink (part of Skyworks Solutions) is a place that need to invest in new equipment, and the engineering technician position is more like an assembler position not much room to develop a career."

good,"You work 3-4 days a week in 12 hour shifts. Expect to take home around $2000 a month. You will not get federal holidays off, you will instead receive triple pay for that/those days. That being said, knowing that the company regularly boasts of revenues in the muliple hundreds of millions of dollars every quarter makes the level of pay a frequent topic of discussion among employees. It is still, however, a better paying job for those with no degree. You can request to work a lot of overtime if you want. Managers are considerate, communicative, and handle all issues professionally. Opportunities for advancement are present and do include raises. They'll pay for school if it's a relevant field to the company. Biggest issue, however, is injury. This is a fast paced assembly job, injuries of the hand, wrist, and arms are not uncommon from overuse."

good,Para mi es una de las mejores empresas en las que he trabajado...
good,"I worked at Skyworks for several years, Had to re-locate and would of remained but family comes first.

I learned the depth of music and the diversity of it. The whole part of the job was very difficult, I cant say anything about it was easy, it was a very crazy hectic job. Never a dull moment.

Management was great due to the fact that employees get rewarded bonuses for completing monthly output goals. Co-workers were great, had a good sense of humor and hard working. Hardest part of the job would have to be when our lead calls in sick and i am 2nd lead. Being in charge of production on our shift was tough but it made the day go by faster"
