rating,review
bad,Forced overtime with minimal time between shifts.  Management in the bottling house is horrible.  You can’t make any plans outside of work because they force you to work weekends with limited notice.  I wouldn’t recommended working here if you have an active social life.
bad,Job didn't pay much but it was easy and lots of benefits. A lot of people left for better pay wish I had. The last 2 years was bad because they started pinching pennies like crazy.
bad,An uptight corporate environment that will stab you in the back. Will be all smiles on the surface but will micro-manage and look for any opportunity to cut you down.
bad,"Management is cut throat. Looking to fire everyone or nonsense matters. Cut security jobs and hired contractor company. Has 2 tier wages which reminds me of when women would do the same job as men and get paid a lot less. "
bad,Interview process was not truthful.  Management out of touch.  Almost no training provided.  Vague expectations.  Lots of favoritism.  Not family friendly.  As I said above.  Wish I had never worked here.  Waste of time and very difficult on my family.
bad,Me refiero a lo referente a bebidas de baja graduación lo veo muy complicado que uno creciendo horizontalmente  le den una patada en el rabo y prostituyan  las bebidas con una serie de precios bajos que hasta los calzones se bajan yo tengo vendiendo su producto por muchos años  y no son capaces de regular esto recuerden que estan donde estan por la venta horizontal  si alguien lee esto haganlo llegar a dirección soy una persona de guadalajara no sean ojetes
bad,"Could have been a good job, but attitude reflects leadership and the leadership at this Trinity Al facility is abysmal. The exspections are not based in reality and regard for the Technicians is almost zero. This place is a revolving door of turnover and its roots are in the front office. The manager is rude, makes inappropriate jokes, and does not care if anyone in the facility stays or goes."
bad,Management at this place is a joke.If they like you then you are golden but if not they try to find reasons to get you out of there.You only get raises every six months for your first 2 years and then your at your cap and can’t go any higher in pay unless a position opens up and then you better know someone and be in their good graces to get the position.They never fix anything the right way it’s always bandaided so they keep going down so you pretty much clean all day long.Managment never communicates with the employees and it causes a lot of getting in trouble o
bad,There is a system there called the good ol' boy. I myself have seen so much racial behavior pertaining to people of color. Its deep rooted and if you dare speak about it you will be targeted and they will find away to get you out the door.
bad,Pas d'ame au sein de cette entreprise
bad,"It's what you'd expect from a sawmill, despite the hype up from the new hire orientation. The people are good to work with, however, the management is quite under-trained."
bad,"Brown Forman hires talented professionals with proven track record and industry contacts. The Orientation program at corporate is good, but integration within local teams is difficult and clicky, due to lack of communication of roles & responsibilities. "
bad,"I worked the third shift in the quality control lab. My day would start at 10:30pm and end at 7:30am. I was in charge of processing samples of liquor and verifying certain characteristics such as color, alcohol content, pH, and brix. I was also responsible for the maintenance of quality on the bottling line. I learned how to manage my time, balance multiple tasks at once, and anticipate problems before they occur. "
bad,"I worked at Brown Forman for 34 years before I was let go for absolutely no reason.  Brown Forman is very bad about using people and using them up and then getting rid of them whenever they feel like it.  I was an excellent hard working employee and since there was no reason to let me go for my performance, they said it was because of a reorganization, which is a joke.  I worked in Human Resources for 15 years, and saw some really terrible things happen to people.  There is no job security whatsoever."
bad,"Sempre apresentável e pontual ao horário e local de serviço , sempre com vocabulário sem gírias e bem comunicativo ."
bad,Pay is good and they have happy hours sometimes to let people socialize and decompress. Upward growth is difficult and loyalty to current employees is lacking
bad,Drugs are an issue....professionalism is way down. Management also seems to really not care about important things especially when it comes down to employee downtime
good,"Çok şey verdiğim yer, fakat boşa emek verilmiş sadece, çalışmaktan ziyade ikili ilişkinize göre değer gördüğünüz bir ortam."
good,Apesar de várias avaliações negativas que existem sobre a Microcamp tenho muito a agradecer a empresa. Eles foram os primeiros a ver potencial em mim e me oferecer uma oportunidade.
good,The job is extremely hot in the summer and extremely cold in the winter. Employees are expected 2 work overtime with no notice. Employees are expected to be qualified and trained for the jobs they are doing yet there is no training program and it's more like a learn as you go system
good,Limited career advancement partially due to low turnover but also due to hiring from outside for middle and upper positions instead of promoting from within.
good,Was a good learning experience and offers outstanding benefits to their employees.
good,"Has been and educating and enlightening experience. Very interesting industry. Friendly colleagues, excellent employee orientation."
good,"Todos los lunes junta con mi equipo de trabajo para revisar estatus de proyectos, necesidades, problemas.  Después actualización de reportes de mercados, elaborar presentaciones para que la toma de decisión con insights importantes. "
good,"clock in at 6 am. Work until 9 then a 15 min break then lunch at 11:30 and last break at 2:30 and we clock out at 4:30. Fast paced job. Management could be better. Hardest part of the job is some days keeping up. Best part of the job is we work 4 days a week and are off Friday, Saturday and Sunday"

good,"A Brown Forman baseia sua motivaçao na meritocracia, num ambiente saudavel e harmonioso."
good,"I would usually be on one machine a day, unless I was getting trained to operate a different machine at a different stage of the barrel making process. The management wasn't the best ever, but you learn to deal, a job is a job so you just keep your head down and do what you need to do to get the job done. The hardest part of the job by far would be having to become qualified at raising barrels. That is where you actually make the body of the barrels at, and you were expected to make a certain number of barrels by the end of the shift, and if you could not do that over a period of a week, you would be fired. The most enjoyable part of the job would actually be just knowing that you are making barrels that are going to be used to create whiskey that everyone enjoys, in a funny way it makes you feel like you were a pivotal part of how whiskey is made."
good,"Had interesting challenging projects with good proffessionals ,.  Had a  long carrier there with opportunities. The industry is fun, the company big enough to make it  challenging  but small  enough to be well paid."

good,"At this time I had 10 states in the Midwest, I spent about 75% of the time in WI or MN.  Work withs in both on and off premise was a huge part of my time spent.  One day a week was given to office duties and about 15% was given to my other markets.

good,"Great place to work; highly political. The politics is not obvious, but it is there. You only notice it when you see under-performers advance."
good,I worked at the new stave mill at Stevenson. Al. The work was very labor intensive even at the plant supervisor level. I would stay after hours every day and help maintenance ensure all equipment was ready for the next day. As this was a salaried job no overtime was paid to me. The overall company culture was great but not a lot of opportunity to move to other facilities.

good,I typically process invoices and work on excel spreadsheets and databases regarding vendor information.  The most important thing I've learned from this is to ask questions and always ask for something to do if there is down time.
