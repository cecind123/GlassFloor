bad,"i was a 3rd party call center for pc mastercard. in a nutshell people dont call you because their happy with their card. This job was very stressful, once you ended one call another would come in instantlly most of hte time. so you had no downtime."
bad,"You get hired only if you got refered by someone, at the workplace they treat you unfairly, they are very racist act like if you not hispanic you cant stay as an employee. "
bad,"I liked the actual work that I did while there, but that was the only thing I liked about it.  They have a very poor attitude towards employees.  Like they were a necessary evil."
bad,"Corp. security makes the security outside agency very stressful   Brian King Mastercard Corp  security is a racist, and sexually harasses the female guards and threatens them with being fired if they talk    "
bad,As a software engineer don’t come to this company you will not develop as an engineer also less paid than other companies. No work/life balance you would end up crazy
bad,"I would not recommend this place to my family and friends. There are good, honest, hardworking people at MasterCard and there are a lot of other types of leaders. While the pay is good the churn is high."
bad,"On paper, the company looks great to work for with great pay and decent benefits but it's all smoke and mirrors. If you work in any sort of Operations or Account Management role, say goodbye to work/life balance. You'll also be paid less than people at the same level that work less outside of those organizations. Expect to be bogged down in senseless meetings throughout most of the day and still expected to hit deadlines with the few hours that you have left over. This place is chaos and it starts with the executive management that clearly have no centralized focus, especially within any sort of operations whether it's technical, development, or business.  Now, if you're an entry to lower level applicant, definitely get in there but know that your job will never be safe so milk it quickly and then escape as fast as you can. 60 hour work weeks should be expected but if you're up against deadlines or your management is even more clueless than the rest of them, get ready to easily push 90 hour weeks with no reward except a salary which you have no time to enjoy"
bad,Answer calls for loyalty and rewards. A lot of the information was delayed between MasterCard and the banks were always delayed. Management was a little shady their was definitely favoritism shown through out this campaign at Telus. The hardest part was when a customer didn't receive their item and have to deal directly with the bank Key Bank was the hardest Bank to deal with and Wells Fargo.
bad,everyone there is in everyones business its very unorganized your job is never really secure the supervisors know nothing you'll know more than them the heads of master card are really nice and down to earth karen and lynn i would work with them directly if i ever had the chance
bad,"You get immense pressure for the work you are not even responsible for. Bad management techniques and the organisation is still learning on how to implement Agile in their working culture."
bad,"Terrible Manager, politics, ""Co. wrapped around axle"""
bad,"Mastercard has long tenure employees that are resistant to change, therefore, outsiders coming in are not welcomed.  The tenured employees make it impossible to get a new product or strategy executed.  Historically, the company was considered a 'country club' and that is exactly how they run the company.  The technology side of the business executes on leading technology but the business/product owners have a very different mentality."
bad,"Organizational transformation currently underway and many managers and employees are unable to advance in their careers. There is a mood of selfishness among senior management and while talent management organization does exist, there is little movement done save for those managers that preserve friendships over skillset."
bad,"Very consistent place to work paycheque wise, however I am not sure if the mental stress is worth it since the company is only paying minimum wage for banking services and it does not suffice the mental distress a customer can put one through."
bad,"There seems to be too much management politics in this company. Ideally the politics should not be coming down to technical team members, but in recent years it has become bad enough that the level of politics started to affect technical team as well. Unfair year end review practices has led to brain drain in the organization."
bad,"Tend to make contractors feel like outsiders.  Too many politics , not enough training and people working on their own agendas rather than developing their staff.  Glad I only worked here as contractor. Not a company I would persnally recommend to a friend or family member."
bad,"I would say this is not a place to work unless you are fully prepared to be a 9-5er and are just collecting a paycheck. If you have no ambitions and if you don't mind seeing a lot of waste and spin - then this is the place for you. Otherwise, think about it - this is a tax collection business - they take 2.5% or so on retail and other transactions so it takes on the culture of a tax collector which is in essence a government function. Given the fact that this is a 2-company duopoly - it is a government like entity no matter how the management spins it. Nothing wrong with that but be forewarned."
bad,"Mastercard has changed a lot in the past few years. The business model is terrific and the CEO is inspiring. Other senior managers are not up to par. There is no loyalty at this company toward long-term employees with a focus on hiring millennials who are just using the name to pad their resumes. It's very upsetting for employees who have put a lot of work in to make this company great when we get passed over for promotions and lateral opportunities given to unqualified newcomers. If you are under 30, you will be hired. Over 30? Don't bother unless you are in Human Resources since they are the only business unit that actually promotes their teams."
bad,"extremely high sales targets and management which did not provide effective coaching. In this role, everything is learned from trial and error. However, the compensation is at par with work put in."
bad,"MasterCard has a lot of opportunities for computer science and business minded people. However the authentication department lacks good organization skills and treats contractors poor. However, they have a lot's of talented people employed."
good,"There is a so much of work,No Work Life Balance, Management do not trust on employees. Hardest part of the job is too much expectation and no flexibility"
good,"relax and friendly, managers lead the tempo of the day to day and some appear to always be on a crisis mode... other than that; good experience.  As a contractor, good working environment, modern equipment and great office location."
good,"The company does a lot for the community. Very fast paced, some work life balance depending on the team your in and some good perks.  Managing up works best here for career advancement."
good,"Great work life balance, Great repository for publications and learning material, people are fun and lot of employee engagement programs. Lot of opportunities to participate in competitive contests."
good,"Good Benefits, very stressful job. management is awful, they don't treat all the employees as fair as they should. Good thing you can learn a lot and the team has very good people"
good,"Firstly the cafeteria and amenities are nice.  No complaint there.  Nice campus, picturesque building, etc."
good,Benefits are not good. Advancement opportunities are few. Very unpredictable schedule
good,"Lavoro occasionale, ambiente piacevole e giovanile."
good,"This was a contract position....therefore my time there not that long. However i got an opportunity to work as a Scrum Master, and work on high profile projects."
good,"This is a good place for entry level customer service positions. It has a lot of learning potential - both dealing with external customers and internal superiors/co-workers and management. "
good,It's a good company to work at given the compensation and benefits offered.  It is learning while growing really fast with a great chance to become a better place to work at.
good,"There are particular departments which are clearly racist. There is so little diversity, it is appalling. I am not sure how this company gets away with keeping particular departments, with higher executives, devoid of any people of color."
good,"I worked this job along time ago, the job was routine administrative work at very low pay.  Employees were very nice and professional and office environment was very pleasant."
good,"A typical day at works starts with the escalated issues. It is challenging to take up things which come day to day. "
good,"A typical day at work is mostly relax, sometimes busy.  Most employees are great people to work with. Poor management."
good,Within the area of Mastercard advisors.  It was a cut-throat environment lacking of work-life balance.  Regularly worked 14-16 hours days with regular travel.  The salaries and benefits are good but do not make up for the lack of work-life balance.
good,"All of the jobs are in St. Louis, and you have to relocate if you want to further your career. They pick and choose who to promote. There is no advancement for people of color or women, from what I have seen. Everyone is competing form one position that is open. The pay is not what it should be."
good,"Great benefits, generous - fair compensation, divisive work culture in Advisors extends through senior management. Employees are recognized based on popularity not performance."
good,"average place to work, little or no life work balance, significant reorganization within departments every other year, management and leadership varies significantly by department."
good,"Job Culture is good.But After Acquisition Salary benifits were no given to employees.No Onsite for Developer."
good,"More political workplace than most -- a lot of people focused on marketing themselves and promoting their initiatives as a ""success"" even when said initiatives fall flat."
good,"This is a workplace where we meet a lot people with various background and culture. However, I think between hiring process and retention, they need more improvement."
good,"Worked in different jobs: Return Items Department -when a check was deposited and then returned. Looking for why Customers writing a check and it was returned for non payment. Bookkeeping Department -settling 200 ledgers daily to zero balance. Locating deposits that did not post to accounts. Master Card Fraud Department-when a charge post to credit card account and the customer sis not make, stopping a credit card that a customer did not receive in the mail an issue another one. Teller-waiting on customers when they made a deposit to accounts or cashing checks. Proof Department- proof adding customers deposit put through teller's work  making sure the added correctly. Proof adding tellers work making sure they settled their work correctly."
good,"Friendly staff, and relaxed atmosphere. Assistance available whenever required. Learnt various things from fraud, project management and customer relationships."
good,The company is very good at teaching you how to perform the job but there are too many kids and not everyone wants to help you learn.  it is not a permanent position because they can fire you at anytime and with no reason.  There is a lot of bullying and harassment.
good,"If you don't go along with the ""click"" your days are numbered. Too much emphasis placed on your attire. A lot of ""brown noseing""  If you disagree just beware."
good,"Good Place to work but did not had the learning opportunity, I improved a lot as a lead which helps me to raise my bar."
good,If you are looking for an entry Job this is the place but you got to get moving the job gets boring after a little while with not many options to move up
good,A good place to work generally but a lot of time is wasted by long processes which don't really as intended.  They are very much in need of a LEAN/Six Sigma style review to stop wasting all this time and energy.
good,"Overall solid place to work, intense workload with minimal chance to advance in group, people tend to work in silos though always trying to breakthrough, collaboration decent but lack of understanding of roles can lead to obstacles."
good,"Difficult to advance - goals at times can be difficult to reach. Compensation and benefits are very good, but it is difficult to achieve bonuses as outlined during ""goal setting"" period and annual reviews."
good,"Being a big company provides the opportunity to move around and increase experience."
good,"clash of old culture and new culture."
good,"A typical day: there is no such thing. My days vary from minute to minute."
good,Good learning experience. But in adoption of technology it is laid back. Also due to working with US normally the rush starts after 6 PM. So managing work life is a bit of challenge
good,"Enjoy work with my co-workers, but management people not so great. My Team Leader provided great support but higher manager no."
good,"Empresa que lhe permite adquirir experiência internacional com times de diversos países. Oferece um ambiente agradável de trabalho, bons salários e benefícios mas com raras chances de crescimento de carreira no Brasil."
good,Mastercard was a decent place to work. i worked with a very smart group of individuals that delivered quality software to is product owners. Time management is key to success at Mastercard.
good,"Master Card is a client of Sedgwick, not the actual employer.  therefor it is not fair to actually rate Master Card as an actual employer. "
good,Mastercard is  a place where you need to handle your own career. Many people are expected to make their own way and only you can decide how much or how little you want to put in.
good,This company offers great starting salary and lots of opportunities to have independance and creativity within the position. The expectations for positions are high
good,"The company has a pretty long probationary period and is very fast paced. The company is growing rapidly and is an overall good place to work, but quite stressful at times."
good,"A lot of talented people work here who want to excel.  The culture which is openly promoted should allow for this.  However, there lacks a cohesive partnership in upper management to identify and achieve common goals, so personal politics blunt or derail a lot of what could be great."
good,"Successfully placed me in a role with a major corporation within 1 week of registering with Kelly.  The position was a long-term assignment, and ultimately I was hired directly into the client company."
good,had a great opportunity to grow in information security.  Would like to have been able to extend my short term contract.  Communication was good but not clear from management.
good,I only worked at Mastercard as a consultant for one year. I enjoyed working there and was hopeful to convert to an employee position which is the only reason I left.
good,"Mastercard is a pretty good company to work at, with some good people that really care. Over the past few years the culture has been continuously evolving from the traditional corporate environment. It is great for employees with families and is working hard to stay current with office practice trends. It is dress down, jeans and sneakers acceptable, but still several employees that still wear suits or business casual."
good,"Good for IT professionals starting their career."
good,"Dynamic and engaging work environment focusing mainly on the support and operation of the Mastercard Pre-Paid card business, specifically, the global Cash-Passport product."
good,"After 15, 20, 25 years of service you can be let go regardless. Learn what you can and take advantage of the great benefits while you can."
good,Stressful job but enjoyable. Great team in Mexico. Management could be better. Good environment every day. It is a good company in Mexico City with good benefits.
good,"There were not a lot of job opportunities at MasterCard in Purchase, New York.  MasterCard are good corporate citizens and they give back to many communities around the world"
good,"As Director of Corporate Security I was responsible for ensuring the safety and security of the employees and company assets. I didn't have a typical work day due to unexpected occurrences such as emergencies and work place incidents. I had to multitask on a daily basis.  In addition to security related responsibilities I handled a variety of administrative tasks.  "
good,"MasterCard Advisors, the consulting & data specialists for parent MasterCard has a great opportunity to create a fantastic business. The challenges include a poorly articulated commission plan, slow responding solution teams, overly ambitious revenue expectations and being overshadowed by the parent org card business. But, the seeds of a great business are there."
good,"Most of the things are good in terms of work-life balance, good culture and good environment, work from home facility. Also stability of job is also okay."
good,"MasterCard is a truly global company that looks to leverage learning and align business strategies across the globe, where it makes sense to do so."
good,The size of the operation and the multi level organizational structure makes it hard to see the full picture and utilize skills across the board.
good,"Mastercard was a great company to work for, environment was professional and they was always someone there to help when i did need assistance"
good,"I enjoyed working at master card. Team is very collaborative and innovative. "
good,It was a good company to work for at the exception that the internal management have a lot of improvement to make in order to keep a nice and professional environment as well as the good work going.
good,"a good communication with the customers/clients before sales"
good,"A typical Bank Teller' day generally included a personal and corporate servicing and presenting the bank products. Conducting customer transactions – loan payments, saving deposits and etc."
good,"They work outrageous hours and think they own you.  Very little opportunity for advancement unless you are younger than 25.  They value degrees, not people - talent is not rewarded."
good,"At Xerox, analyst worked to adhere to client service level agreements. We fixed our clients technical issues with great skills provided through company excellent training models. The incentives were awesome and bonuses real. This job I'd recommend for long hall despite obvious political problems."
good,"MasterCard is a fantastic company to work for as it pertains to benefits, bonuses and salary. As technology grows, the work/life balance is not as strong as it once was."
good,"If you are a fresher or looking to start a career i would not recommend this place since there are lot of employees working there since ages who would handle most of the things which provides no scope for growth. No margin for error, do a mistake, get fired and you won't even know it until everyone else knows it."
good,MasterCard provides unique opportunities to work in the payment processing industry using cutting edge technologies to offer products and services to make electronic payments secure and fast.
good,"Like everywhere else, it depends on who you work for and with.  The company is trying to move into the 21st century, but the shackles of bureaucracy still hold strong."
good,A typical day at work consisted of supporting a manager with business and personal needs. What I learred was that networking is your best asset in a large organization.  The management styles vary from one department to the next. My coworkers were very supportive of me and my abilities. The hardest part of the job was learning how to become thick skinned. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I came to know on a personal level. MasterCard is a company with core values focusing on custumer needs and advanced technology.
good,"MasterCard processes transactions. Worldwide leader in payments industry."
good,"Day to day duties are Scheduling, adherence and real time monitoring of over 100 staff, Analyse productivity and performance results across teams and sites and provide recommendations of areas of improvement, Pro-actively monitor and analyse call volumes and profiles per client, new market launch to highlight and action any required changes to the WFM staffing schedules and regular communication with line managers on how their staff are performing in relation to schedules, productivity, call time, after call work, and attendance. Since being in both roles within the company I have gained vast product knowledge, various system knowledge, customer service skills & great communication skills. The hardest part of this role would be working to the tight deadlines, but although that's the hardest task within the role I gain a great sense of accomplishment from this once achieved."
good,I had alot of responsibility and worked alot of hours. I had no personal life for practically 3 years.
good,This was a great place to work. There are amazing people who will support you andy your career growth. Most managers allow a flex work environment and the company strikes a good work-life balance.
good,Great benefits and pay for positions held. Too much office politics and micro-managing to allow people to take leads on work.  The on-boarding process and training does not exist and you are expected to jump in full speed.
good,"not comfortable rating these companies in public.  Payments category was very competitive back then, and less so now.  Many changes globally  Interesting times.."
good,"Review current process flows"
good,It is a great place to work but you most develop a great relationship with the Group Head of the Department in order to advance and get recognized.  Unfortunately there is a lot of promotion and career advancement based on your relationship with the Group Head and not your work ability.
good,Mastercard has wide range of products where anyone can get  ample amount of opportunities to learn something new in the area of Credit or debit card business.
good,"My everyday Task where all about been a sales representative and some office work that sometimes it was a bit challenging "
good,"Flexible working 2 days per week from home.  Good working conditions, offices and benefits"
good,"Challenging work, nice people, good work/life balance. "
good,"Reasonable benefits and pay for positions held. managers don't fully align to organizations overall visions, missions, objectives, and goals. Experience outside of Mastercard is not well respected. Company try to copy other technology companies."
good,"It is a placement company so you are in and out."
good,"Good:"
good,"If you can handle a corporate environment, this is a great place to work.  They are dedicated to being good corporate citizens.  The salary and benefits are great."
good,Good benefits and work life balance though don't expect pay raises or opportunities for advancement.  Good place to learn about payments space then move on.
good,"Some of the offices have their own culture and not the Company one. We were part of a region that did nor support our needs, but every year we had double digits growth."
good,"-  Répondre aux téléphone et résoudre les problèmes concernant leurs transactions et relevés de carte de crédit-  Assurer un service personnalisé qui répond aux besoins des clients"
good,Mastercard is a great fortune 500 company which good management and leadership. The company is always looking for ways to be innovative and involve youth into their projects.
good,"I was eager and hungry to learn more. They taught me a lot. Thanks to them, I am able to fly solo and live my career to a new height of information.  Thank you so much!"
good,"Excelente para desenvolvimento pessoal. "
good,"Very good company to work especially in payments sector. Cross language work profile allows you to acquire different skill sets. Newly opened facility in Pune, India has excellent infrastructure."
good,I excepted this position with the promise of not sitting behind a desk for 8 hours and watching a camera.  The company went public and heavy department cuts followed.  Not very exciting job unless you like sitting at a desk for 8 hours and do nothing.
good,"I enjoy working at APW, because i feel it has deveolped me as not only an employee but as a person.I feel i have progressed and learnt alot about the payment card industry and how it operates. A typical day would see me come into an office, that more often then not contains a good enviroment. As part of the fraud department our main role was to prevent any loss from fraudulent activity and process Sanction checking. Over the years i have learnt about different varities of fraud. New and old, the process/importance of sanctions.. and about spending patterns, not only in the /uk but worldwide. The most enjoyable ascpect of the role is the pleasing feeling you recieve when you stop a substantial ammount of fraud from occuring on payment cards. This obviously benefits the cardholder as they respect and appreciate the job we are doing,but also the company as we are minimizing any potential loss."
good,"The company is a great company to work, the people are very professional and respectful.  The company has recently changed the President and the Market Development Division will go under organizational changes.  I am being proactive in starting to look closer to my home address."
good,It is a Buerocratic nightmare.  Really bad management refuses to admit the mess is due to them. Promotions at upper levels for technical workers are made of unobtanium.
good,"Good company, but dirty office politics,"
good,"The company as a whole is a great place to work. Altough they promote work life balance, you won't find that in some departments. Like any other workplace, you have some supervisors that have no compassion and do not give praise for a job well done but then, you have other supervisors that make you feel great about going to work everyday."
good,"Can be a great company if you are in the right group. The company is doing lots of great things to be proud of.  Many employees are very cut throat there, not exactly the kind of co-workers you want.  If you land in the right group, it has lots of potential though."
good,"Good company,  enjoyed talking with card holders. Liked managing customers accounts looking for fraud.  Liked knowing I was helping people not be taken advantage of."
good,I really enjoyed working here as there was plenty of time to learn how it is to work in Help desk. The pay was definitely not the best but good enough to stay and learn what you need and move on.
good,"Lack of work/life balance"
good,"not a bad place to work. "
good,You need to find your own path within the organisation. Work independently almost all the time and seek help from relevant SMEs within and outside the organisation.
good,"Depending what team you are in the environment can be very political, with the right in needed to advance but this does not apply to the whole company.  Overall great CEO and company vision."
good,"Mastercard is an exciting and innovative company, depending on where you work in the organization, one can advance quickly - however the culture is cut throat and stressful."
good,"Use 4XSystems, Inbound and Outbound calls inc B2B, Emailing, Faxing, Excalating when needed, dealing with complaints, securing sensitive data and personal information, recommending financial uses, International calls dealing with International timescales, hitting targets, building rapport, going the extra mile."
good,"Unless you’re ou’re working for a favored manager who likes your work and will defend you, you’re in for a tough ride  Job Security exists only at HQ so remote teams are often atvr"
good,"High intensity, challenging environment for driven employees.  Great leadership at top, middle level managers less great.  Lots of traveling at regional offices."
good,People in management tend to depend on other people's skill set to get through the day.  Overall it is a great company to work for if you have the right manager who is collaborative.
good,"* Very soothing environment"
good,MasterCard is changing as the world change. great company to work in.  Culture is targeting the millenium generation.  .. Co workers are great. they are team players.
good,"- Conhecimento na dinâmica de um grande banco publico"
good,"Team morale has declined noticeably within the past couple of years. It is no longer a fun place to work. The customer contact is great, but that is no longer the priority."
good,"> Employee facilities are good."
good,I felt the environment was collaborative and I was given a great deal of independence.  I would have stayed if they had job openings when my contract was up
good,"Working at the TechHub in NYC Mastercard tries to create a ""start up"" culture. The office is very nice. Modern. Open. No offices. However, from a cultural stand-point they are not successful. Start up/Agile environments that they are trying to cultivate succeed because of the empowerment of the teams. Teams are given autonomy to get the job done any way they want. Those companies don't stress over how the office is decorated. If it helps productivity that's all that matters.  At MC the command-and-control culture of a big multi-national corporation is still very evident. Case in point: the rolling desk pedestals have a cushioned top with one of three colors. These colors correspond to the color of the columns in various areas of the floor. Red pedestals MUST stay near Red columns! It's indicative of the controlling - not empowering - nature of the culture."
good,good experience of working!!!challenging project which helped me to learn a lot more and its a very good experience to be a part of this organization.
good,I reported to the Regional Office in Mexico. Different culture than the one I was used to see in the US. I had issues with the way Senior management treated employyes.
good,"Great company, very innovative, nice people and a great campus. Location is rural and not a great fit for people who commute in from Manhattan or Long Island."
good,Human resources and Management team are employee friendly. Master card provided a dynamic work environment where you could learn and grow with the organization at faster pace
good,"It's been a great pleasure to be part of the MasterCard Concierege Team ..... Throughout my time working with them, I was able to grow professionally."
good,"There are a lot of opportunities at Mastercard, however it is a challenge to advance.  There is a lot of opportunity to work from home, and good benefits are offered."
good,"Constantly look for ideas to grow the business. Good employee perks and management listens to employee ideas. However, some days can have long hours."
good,"I liked my job, but the career opportunities in St Louis were limited for the career track I was interested in pursuing.  Career opportunities seemed more available in NY."
good,"Maintain very busy calendar, arrange meetings, travel, conference calls, etc., process T&E's.  Work independently on variety of projects."
good,Good Company.  Most managers understand the importance of work/life balance.  People are its biggest asset.  It has a very nice culture.
good,MasterCard is a leader in the digital payments innovation space including defining industry standards for interoperability and scalability.
good,"MasterCard is a great place to work.  The pace is fast, and the creativity flows.  It's very collegial, and I work with a very talented group of people."
good,"Great way to build communication skills. "
good,MasterCard at Telus International is a very good company to work for. Only problem that I had is that it was a new company and too many people jockeying for positions they were not qualified for and some people were actually placed in positions. Due to this MANY people were fired without good reason.
good,Have enjoyed working here and appreciate having the opportunity to work with.   Had nice and favorable support and encouragement throughout the years.
good,This company is trying to be new age but is still stuck in the past.
good,"work 9-5:30 cant change for the first year, hardest part of job is trying to learn all the acronyms they use.  The most enjoyable part is being able to say I work at mastercard.  The thing I dont like the most is the non flexibility of the position I am in.  I do know that if you get in with a different position they may have more flexibility."
good,"Loved working at mastercard.  Everyone is friendly.  They have an open-door policy and there is encouragement from management to move up.  They offer great benefits and very active in supporting such things as ""Back-to-School"" They do donate to those in need. They are culture friendly."
good,It's been too long ago to give a review of this company.  The one thing I can say is that they had an excellent 401K plan while I was there.  MasterCard matched $2 for every $1 dollar that I put into my 401K.
good,Great place to work for innovative minds and forward thinkers. No day is exactly like another.  great organization that provides opportunities to give back and get involved with the community.
good,Interesting place to work with good work life balance.  It is difficult to move internally.  There are interesting projects to work on but things take a long time to get done.
good,"It was good experience with mastercard they are basically in banking backend domain and they generate good revinew per year in the market."
good,"Mastercard was a good company that provided challenging, aggressive work goals, with a good mix of technologies. The location was a bit far from the city."
good,"Worked in Production Control to do scheduling tasks for mainframe jobs. Learned new ways to use scheduling software. Management on the whole was very dedicated to getting the job done. Mastercard staff was very professional, but friendly at the same time. Keeping up with the shear volume of the the work was intense. The was a definite sense of team work to get the job done."
good,"Due to scope of the job at Mastercard I was required to work alternating 12 hour - 3 day, 4 day work weeks. I was required to be on call for support during my off hours and days. On the most part work was done on a very professional level. As with all large corporations there were problems but the staff were very dedicated to resolving them. My interaction with Mastecard team members was very positive and I was very impressed with their dedication."
good,"Good environment and nice management."
good,"To be successful in this role, one must enjoy working with others in a team setting as well as with multiple levels of management.  It is essential to be organized, friendly with customer account personnel and possess the ability to multi-task and negotiate deadlines for various projects."
good,"at my job, time flies, it is high pressure but rewarding, good atmosphere, high professional level from most co-workers, multinational/multi cultural environment."
good,"Great people to work with, unbelievable amount of talent to surround yourself with, however, it was fairly compartmentalized in certain areas, so advancement within some verticals was difficult."
good,"Enjoyed working at this company. Learned a lot during my stay. People were nice and management was open and honest. Took several training to skill my self. Overall, it was a good experience."
good,Sitting at a desk on the phones all day can get boring but surrounded by my colleagues its never a dull day a this call Centre.
good,"This is a very good company to work for, good people. The typical day at work is awesome, just get your job done."
good,It was interesting to learn how we could help people around the world.
good,I learned the many facets of the banking industry as well as the credit card industry.
good,Focused on preferred employer status and diversity in the workplace. Enjoyed the cross-functional project management teams.
good,"Work pace is relatively fast with tight deadlines."
good,"Just setting your expectations. You will be paid 25% higher than anywhere else, but the work load is unrealistic. Some people can manage long term. I did 6 years, saved my pennies, and got out when it stopped being worth it personally. Find yourself a manager who can shield you from the BS and you’ll last longer. Culturally combative from the top down. Still worth it for the experience and the boost to my net worth. (Speaking for STL and NY locations only)"

You get a chance to speak with people from everywhere and people that are from the US visiting everywhere and educate them about benefits they may not have been aware of. Our management team was very relaxed and open. Helped anytime it was needed. It was a fairly easy job but without paid time off it made it hard to balance family events that could occur during work hours.

A normal day at work consisted of sitting in front of a computer screen attached to a headset either taking calls or making them.

I learned how tax codes work in Europe and how to process correctly so MasterCard receives the discounts from the different governments in Europe.  In turn, the refunds go to MasterCard which provides a savings of several million dollars a year.  Incentive invoices proved the most challenging because the process was inefficient and required review at least three times, enter into the system and place on hold, then wait for the hold-release for the payment to be made.  To overcome this, we streamlined the process to only review twice and only enter into the system once the invoice was ready to be paid.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the volume of work that needed to be processed.  There was always something to do and always something new to learn.
